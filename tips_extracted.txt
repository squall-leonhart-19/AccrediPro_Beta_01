30 DAILY COMMUNITY TIPS - WEEK 1 (FINAL VERSION)



You Don't Need to Know Everything

Hi there! 💕

Can I tell you a secret? On the day I got my first paying client, I was TERRIFIED. I thought I needed to have every answer memorized, every protocol perfected, every possible scenario prepared for.

Want to know what actually happened?

My client asked me a question I didn't know the answer to. And you know what I said? "That's a great question - let me research that and get back to you by tomorrow."

She didn't fire me. She didn't ask for a refund. She actually said, "I love that you're honest and thorough!"

Here's the truth: Your clients don't need you to be a walking encyclopedia. They need you to:

✅ Listen deeply to their struggles ✅ Care genuinely about their transformation ✅ Be honest when you don't know something ✅ Research and learn alongside them ✅ Show up consistently with your whole heart

You're not supposed to know everything on Day 1. You're supposed to be willing to learn, grow, and support your clients through their journey.

The certification gives you the foundation. Your heart and commitment give you everything else.

With belief in you, Sarah ✨

💬 YOUR TURN: What's the ONE question you're most afraid a client will ask you? Drop it in the comments - let's normalize not knowing everything!

And here's the magic: I bet someone in this community actually has the answer. That's the power of learning together. 👇



DAY 2 (TUESDAY): Your First Client Is Closer Than You Think

Hi! 💕

I know what you're thinking: "Who would actually pay ME for coaching?"

Let me paint you a picture of where your first client probably is right now:

👉 Your friend who always asks you for health advice 👉 Your coworker who saw you transform your own health 👉 Your sister who keeps saying "I wish I could figure out what you figured out" 👉 That person in your yoga class who mentioned their gut issues 👉 Your neighbor who's struggling with fatigue and "normal" labs

Your first client isn't a stranger who finds you through some perfect marketing funnel.

Your first client is someone who already knows you, trusts you, and has watched you either:

Transform your own health, OR

Show genuine care about helping people

Here's what's stopping you:

You're waiting for the "perfect" approach, the "right" time, the "complete" package.

But your first client just needs you to say: "Hey, I'm certified now. Can we talk about what you're going through?"

That's it. One conversation.

Struggling with HOW to have that conversation?

That's exactly what we cover in Level 2 - Client Acquisition Mastery. I walk you through:

How to approach people without being weird

What to say in that first conversation

How to transition from "friend" to "coach"

When and how to talk about pricing

How to handle "I need to think about it"

3 students landed their first client within 48 hours of taking that training.

Ready to level up? Comment 'LEVEL 2' below and I'll DM you all the details.

Or just go for it on your own - the most important thing is HAVING the conversation, not having it perfectly.

Your homework: Make a list of 5 people in your life who fit that description above. Don't reach out yet - just notice who they are.

You've got this! Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: Without naming names, describe your ideal first client in the comments. What are they struggling with? What keeps them up at night?

Let's make them REAL in your mind!



DAY 3 (WEDNESDAY): Imposter Syndrome Is a Sign You're Growing

Hi there! 💕

Did you wake up today thinking: "Who am I to call myself a coach? I just finished this certification. I'm not qualified enough."

GOOD.

Wait, what? Good?!

Yes. Because that voice means you care deeply about doing this right. It means you have humility and integrity. It means you're taking this seriously.

Want to know who DOESN'T have imposter syndrome?

People who overestimate their abilities and charge into things recklessly. (We've all met them, right?)

Here's what I've learned after working with thousands of students:

The ones who feel "not ready enough" often become the BEST coaches. Why?

✅ They study more thoroughly ✅ They listen more carefully to clients ✅ They stay humble and keep learning ✅ They refer out when appropriate ✅ They build trust through authenticity

Your imposter syndrome isn't a stop sign. It's a compass showing you're heading in the right direction.

The antidote to imposter syndrome isn't waiting until you feel "ready enough."

It's taking action DESPITE the fear and watching yourself rise to meet the moment.

Every single graduate before you felt this way. And every single one who pushed through it now has a thriving practice.

Still feeling paralyzed by it?

We have monthly Group Confidence Coaching calls where I help you work through:

Imposter syndrome spirals

"I'm not ready" limiting beliefs

Comparison traps

Fear of being visible

Pricing anxiety

It's like group therapy for new coaches (but way more productive 😊)

Next call: December 12th, 7pm ET

Included free with All-In-One Access.

Or push through on your own - sometimes the best confidence builder is just DOING the scary thing and realizing you survived it.

You're exactly where you need to be.

With confidence in you, Sarah ✨

Drop a number below - no shame, no judgment. We've ALL been there.

Then reply to at least ONE other person's number with encouragement. Let's lift each other up!



DAY 4 (THURSDAY): Stop Waiting for the Perfect Niche

Hi! 💕

Let me guess - you've spent hours (maybe days?) trying to figure out your "perfect niche":

"Should I focus on hormone health? Gut health? Autoimmune?"

"What if I pick wrong and no one wants to work with me?"

"What if I box myself in and can't help other people?"

I'm about to save you weeks of overthinking:

Start with the health journey YOU lived.

That's it. That's the answer.

Did you heal your own:

Gut issues? → Coach people with gut issues

Hormone imbalances? → Coach people with hormone chaos

Chronic fatigue? → Coach exhausted people dismissed by doctors

Autoimmune condition? → Coach people navigating autoimmunity

Nothing specific but love research? → Start with whoever shows up first

Why does starting with YOUR story work?

✅ You deeply understand their pain ✅ You know the emotional rollercoaster they're on ✅ You've already researched solutions (years of Googling = expertise!) ✅ Your story becomes your most powerful marketing ✅ You'll attract people who see themselves in you

"But Sarah, what if I healed multiple things?"

Pick the ONE you're most passionate about helping others with. Start there.

"What if nothing was seriously wrong with me?"

Then start with whoever shows up first. Help them. Get a testimonial. See what feels good. Your niche will emerge naturally.

Your niche will refine itself as you work with real clients. You don't need to architect it perfectly before you begin.

Still completely stuck and spinning your wheels?

I offer 1:1 Niche Clarity Sessions where we jump on Zoom for 30 minutes and figure out: ✅ Your ideal client (specific, not generic) ✅ Your unique positioning in the market ✅ Your core message that attracts the right people ✅ Your first offer structure

You walk away with a clear niche and action plan - no more overthinking.

Comment 'NICHE' below and I'll DM you the details.

Or use this formula right now (free!):

"I help [specific people] who struggle with [specific problem] so they can [specific result] without [thing they're tired of trying]."

Examples:

"I help women in their 40s struggling with hormone chaos so they can feel like themselves again without HRT or restrictive diets"

"I help exhausted moms with gut issues so they can have energy again without eliminating every food they love"

"I help professionals with burnout and brain fog so they can perform at work without relying on coffee and willpower"

See? Specific, relatable, clear.

Let it be simple.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: Fill in that blank in the comments! "I help _____ with _____ so they can _____."

Even if it's messy, even if you'll change it later - just WRITE something. Let's practice!

And reply to at least 2 other people's niches with encouragement or feedback!



DAY 5 (FRIDAY - FREEBIE DAY): Your Transformation Story IS Your Credibility

🎁 FREEBIE FRIDAY 🎁

Hi there! 💕

Every Friday, I drop ONE premium resource for free to celebrate your hard work this week.

But first, let's talk about your most powerful marketing tool:

Your personal health transformation story.

I need to tell you something that might surprise you:

Your story is worth more than any certification letters after your name.

Credentials matter. (That's why you're here!)

But here's what actually makes potential clients say "I want to work with HER":

"She's been where I am. She gets it. She figured it out. Maybe she can help me too."

Let me show you the difference:

Version 1 (Credential-focused): "I'm a certified Integrative Health Coach with credentials from CMA, IPHM, ICAHP, and IAOTH."

Version 2 (Transformation-focused): "Three years ago, I was exhausted, bloated, and dismissed by doctors who said my labs were 'normal.' I knew something was wrong. After healing myself through functional medicine, I became a certified coach to help women who feel gaslit by the medical system finally get answers and feel like themselves again."

Which one made you FEEL something?

Your story includes: ✅ Where you were (the struggle people relate to) ✅ What you tried that didn't work (shows you understand their frustration) ✅ What finally worked (gives them hope) ✅ Why you're passionate about helping others (proves you genuinely care)

Someone out there is struggling with EXACTLY what you overcame.

And when they hear your story, they'll think: "Finally, someone who understands."

That's when they become your client.



THIS WEEK'S FREEBIE: Your Story Script (Copy-Paste Ready)

I'm giving you my proven word-for-word script for telling your transformation story in a way that builds trust and converts.

This 4-page PDF includes: ✅ The proven 4-part structure (hook → struggle → breakthrough → invitation) ✅ Real examples from 5 successful coaches in our community ✅ Fill-in-the-blank scripts you can customize in 10 minutes ✅ Where to use it (Instagram posts, discovery calls, website About page, networking) ✅ What NOT to say (common mistakes that turn people off)

No overthinking. No staring at a blank page. Just copy, customize, and use TODAY.

Download it here: [link to PDF in community files]



NEXT FRIDAY'S FREEBIE: Client Onboarding Email Scripts (5 copy-paste emails from "Welcome!" to "See you at our first session!")

Own your story! Sarah ✨

💬 GRATITUDE CHAIN: If this script helps you, comment below with one powerful sentence from YOUR transformation story.

Let's practice vulnerability and cheer each other on!

And tag someone else in the community who needs to read this today!



DAY 6 (SATURDAY): You Can Start Coaching BEFORE Your Website Is Perfect

Hi! 💕

Let me guess where you are right now:

You've been researching website builders for hours. Choosing color schemes. Writing and rewriting your About page. Freaking out about photography. Comparing yourself to coaches who have these gorgeous, polished sites.

And meanwhile... you haven't talked to a single potential client.

Can I give you some tough love wrapped in encouragement?

You don't need a website to get your first 3-5 clients.

I know that feels wrong. I know you want everything "professional" before you start. But here's the truth:

Your first clients will come from: 👉 Conversations (not your website) 👉 Relationships (not SEO) 👉 Referrals (not your Instagram aesthetic) 👉 Your story (not your logo)

Here's what you ACTUALLY need to start coaching RIGHT NOW:

✅ A way to schedule calls → Calendly free version (10 minutes to set up) ✅ A way to get paid → Venmo, PayPal, Stripe (you already have one) ✅ A way to communicate → Zoom, email, phone (you have this too) ✅ Your certification → Check! You're here! ✅ Someone who needs help → They're already in your life

That's it. You literally have everything you need TODAY.

"But Sarah, don't I need to look professional?"

Yes! But professionalism comes from:

Showing up on time

Listening deeply to what they're actually saying

Following through on what you promise

Getting your clients actual, measurable results

Communicating clearly and confidently

A beautiful website doesn't make you professional. Your integrity and results do.

Here's what I want you to do THIS WEEK:

Before you spend one more hour on your website:

Make a list of 10 people who might need your help

Reach out to 3 of them (use Friday's story script!)

Have 1 real conversation about their health struggles

Offer to help them (yes, for money - we'll talk pricing Monday!)

That's it. Four simple actions. Zero website required.

Will you eventually want a website? Probably! It's a helpful tool once you have clients and testimonials.

Should you build it now? Only if you already have 2-3 client success stories to showcase on it.

Empty websites don't convert. Results-filled websites do.

So get results first. Build the website second.

My challenge:

Comment below with ONE action you're committing to this week INSTEAD of working on your website.

Examples:

"I'm texting my friend Sarah about her gut issues"

"I'm posting my transformation story on Facebook today"

"I'm scheduling 3 coffee chats this week"

"I'm offering a pilot session to my sister-in-law"

"I'm DMing 5 people who've asked me health questions before"

Let's hold each other accountable to ACTION, not perfection.

Get out there! Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: What's ONE thing you're doing this week instead of building a website? Drop it below - then DO IT!

And reply to 2 other people committing to THEIR action with encouragement! We're in this together!

30 DAILY COMMUNITY TIPS - WEEK 2 (Days 8-14)



DAY 8 (MONDAY): How to Price Your Services Without Undervaluing Yourself

Hi there! 💕

Okay, let's talk about the question that's been keeping you up at night:

"How much should I charge?"

I see this happen ALL the time with new coaches:

"Maybe I'll charge $50/session since I'm new?"

"I don't want to seem greedy..."

"Who would pay ME $200? I just got certified!"

"I'll start low and raise my prices later..."

Let me be really direct with you:

Undercharging doesn't help your clients - it hurts them.

Why? Because when someone pays $25 for coaching, they don't take it seriously. They cancel. They don't do the work. They don't show up. They don't get results.

But when someone invests real money? They show up. They commit. They do the homework. They transform.

Your pricing communicates your value.

Here's what I recommend for NEW coaches:

For your first 3-5 pilot clients: Offer a 4-week intensive at a discounted rate in exchange for detailed feedback and testimonials.

After your pilots:

Single sessions: Start at $150-250

Packages: $800-2000 for 8-12 weeks

"But Sarah, that feels SO high! No one will pay that!"

Wrong. Here's why:

✅ People spend $200/month on supplements that don't work ✅ They spend $150 on facials that last 2 hours ✅ They spend $300/month on meal delivery services ✅ But they won't invest in actually FIXING their health?

Your services are MORE valuable than any of those things.

You're not selling an hour. You're selling transformation.

The real question isn't "Am I worth it?"

The real question is: "Am I committed to getting my clients real, measurable results?"

If yes, then charge accordingly.

Pro tip:

When someone balks at your price, that's not a "you" problem - it's a "fit" problem. They're not your ideal client. Someone else out there WILL invest because they're ready for real change.

Don't shrink your prices to accommodate people who aren't ready. Find the people who are.

Still feeling wobbly about pricing?

We cover this DEEP in our monthly Group Pricing Power Hour where I help you:

Calculate your rates based on your market and goals

Practice saying your price with confidence

Handle price objections without folding

Know when to offer payment plans vs. hold firm

Next session: December 18th, 7pm ET

Included free with All-In-One Access.

Want in? Comment 'PRICING' below and I'll send you upgrade details.

Price like the professional you are! Sarah ✨

💬 YOUR TURN: What are you charging right now? (Or planning to charge?) Drop it below - no judgment, just curiosity!

Let's normalize talking about money as a community. We all struggle with this!



DAY 9 (TUESDAY): What to Say on Your First Discovery Call

Hi! 💕

Okay, this is it - you've got your first discovery call scheduled.

Your palms are sweating. Your mind is racing. You're wondering:

"What do I even SAY?"

"What if they ask something I don't know?"

"How do I 'sell' without being pushy?"

"What if they don't want to work with me?"

"When do I talk about money?!"

Take a breath. I've got you.

Here's the structure that works:

1. Connection (5 minutes): "Thanks so much for taking time to chat! Before we dive in, tell me a little about yourself - what brought you to look for a coach right now?"

→ Listen. Don't interrupt. Take notes.

2. Deep Dive into Their Struggle (15 minutes): "Walk me through what you've already tried... what's been most frustrating... how is this impacting your daily life?"

→ Let them vent. Ask clarifying questions. Show genuine empathy.

3. Paint the Vision (5 minutes): "If we worked together and 3 months from now you were feeling amazing - what would that look like? What would be different?"

→ Let THEM describe success. You're not selling - you're listening.

4. Share How You Can Help (10 minutes): "Based on what you've shared, here's how I'd approach this... [outline your process]... Does this resonate with you?"

→ Be specific. Connect dots between their symptoms and root causes.

5. Discuss Investment (5 minutes): "My 4-week program is [your price] and includes [details]. Does that feel aligned for you?"

→ State your price confidently. Then STOP TALKING. Let them respond.

The secret sauce?

You're not convincing them to work with you. You're discovering if you're a good fit for each other.

If they're not ready, that's okay! Thank them gracefully and move on.

If they ARE ready, congratulations - you have a client! 🎉

Common fears (and how to handle them):

"What if I freeze and forget everything?" → Keep notes in front of you. It's okay to pause and think.

"What if they ask about their specific condition and I don't know enough?" → "Great question - let me research that and get back to you. Based on what I know, here's what I'd explore..."

"What if they want to think about it?" → We'll cover this Saturday! (Spoiler: it's not the end of the conversation)

Want the complete word-for-word script?

I have a Discovery Call Mastery Training that includes: ✅ Complete script (questions to ask at every stage) ✅ How to handle every objection ✅ When and how to talk money ✅ Follow-up email templates ✅ Real recorded calls you can listen to

It's inside Level 2 - Client Acquisition.

Ready to master discovery calls? Comment 'DISCOVERY' below and I'll DM you details.

Or just use the structure above and trust yourself. You don't need to be perfect - you just need to be present, caring, and honest.

You've got this! Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: What's your biggest fear about discovery calls? Drop it below - let's troubleshoot together as a community!

And if you've already DONE a discovery call, share what surprised you most about it!



DAY 10 (WEDNESDAY): The Power of Pilot Programs

Hi there! 💕

Let me tell you about the smartest thing I ever did when I started coaching:

I offered pilot programs.

"Sarah, what's a pilot program?"

Great question! A pilot program is:

✅ A discounted coaching package (usually 50-60% off your eventual rate) ✅ For your first 3-5 clients only ✅ In exchange for detailed feedback and a testimonial ✅ A chance to refine your process before "officially" launching

Why pilot programs are GENIUS:

1. They remove your imposter syndrome: You're not claiming to be a perfect expert - you're upfront that you're refining your approach. Clients appreciate the honesty and feel special being part of it!

2. They lower the barrier for your first clients: Instead of asking someone to invest $1500, you're offering $400-500. Much easier yes!

3. You get REAL experience: Nothing teaches you faster than working with actual humans with actual problems.

4. You build a testimonial library: These success stories become your most powerful marketing FOREVER.

5. You refine your process: You'll discover what works, what doesn't, what your clients need most, and how to structure your offers going forward.

How to structure a pilot program:

"4-Week Health Transformation - Pilot Program"

What's included:

4 one-on-one sessions (weekly)

Email support between sessions

Personalized protocol and action plan

Resources and tracking tools

Your investment: [Your discounted rate - roughly 50% off what you'll eventually charge]

What I need from you:

Honest feedback after each session

Written testimonial at the end

Before/after metrics (photos optional but appreciated!)

Active participation in refining the program

Then say this:

"I'm accepting 5 pilot clients at a significantly reduced rate because I'm refining my coaching process and want to make sure it delivers incredible results. You'll get premium support and transformation, and I'll get real-world experience and feedback. It's a true win-win!"

People LOVE being pilot clients because: 👉 They're getting expert coaching at a fraction of future cost 👉 They feel special being part of something new 👉 They love contributing to your growth 👉 They get extra attention (you're deeply invested in their success)

After your 5 pilots:

You raise your prices to full rate, armed with:

5 detailed testimonials

Confidence in your process

Proof that your methods work

Referrals (happy clients tell everyone!)

This is how you bridge the gap between "certified" and "confident."

Need help structuring your pilot offer?

I walk you through the entire process - pricing, positioning, how to pitch it, what to include, how to get testimonials that convert - in Level 2 Advanced Training.

Plus you get my pilot program templates (copy-paste ready).

Want access? Comment 'PILOT' below and I'll send you the details.

Ready to launch your pilot program? Sarah ✨

💬 YOUR TURN: Who's ready to offer a pilot program? Comment "I'M IN!" below and tell us your niche!

Let's hype each other up! Reply to at least 2 people committing to their pilot with encouragement!



DAY 11 (THURSDAY): You Don't Need a Big Social Media Following

Hi! 💕

I know you've been scrolling through Instagram looking at coaches with 50K followers, thinking:

"I'll never get clients with only 247 followers. I need to build my audience first."

Let me stop you right there.

You don't need thousands of followers to build a thriving coaching practice.

You need 10-20 people who actually know, like, and trust you.

Here's the math that matters:

❌ 10,000 followers who scroll past your posts ✅ 50 engaged people who read, comment, and actually DM you

❌ Posting 3x/day to "grow your audience" ✅ Having 3 real conversations with potential clients

❌ Trying to "go viral" ✅ Building genuine relationships one person at a time

Real story from one of our students:

Jen had 180 Instagram followers when she signed her first client. Then her second. Then her third.

Six months later, she was fully booked with a waiting list - still under 400 followers.

How?

✅ She posted her transformation story authentically (not perfectly) ✅ She engaged meaningfully in comments (not just dropping emojis) ✅ She answered DMs thoughtfully (treating each person like a human) ✅ She offered valuable content without constantly pitching ✅ She asked satisfied clients for referrals

Here's what actually gets you clients:

👉 Depth of connection (not breadth of reach) 👉 Quality conversations (not viral posts) 👉 Trust building (not follower count) 👉 Showing up consistently (not showing up perfectly)

Your action step THIS WEEK:

Stop obsessing over follower count. Start obsessing over connection depth.

Do these 4 things:

Post your transformation story (even if only 100 people see it)

Engage meaningfully with 10 people's content (real comments, not "Great post! 🔥")

DM 3 people and start genuine conversations (not "Hey hun! Want to join my program?")

Offer value without expecting anything back

Remember:

You don't need to be an influencer to be a successful coach. You need to be someone people trust with their health and transformation.

Small audience, deep impact beats large audience, shallow reach EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

You're enough, exactly as you are.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: How many followers do you have right now? Drop the number below - let's prove that size doesn't matter!

I bet we have fully booked coaches here with under 500 followers. Who wants to share their story?

DAY 13 (SATURDAY): How to Handle "I Need to Think About It"

Hi there! 💕

You just had an amazing discovery call. The person loved everything you shared. You talked about your program, the investment, and then...

"This sounds great! I just need to think about it."

Your heart sinks. You say "Of course, no pressure!" and end the call.

Then you never hear from them again.

Sound familiar?

Let's fix this.

"I need to think about it" usually means one of three things:

"I'm not sure I can afford it" (money concern)

"I'm not sure this will work for ME" (trust/belief concern)

"I'm scared of committing and failing again" (fear concern)

Your job isn't to pressure them. It's to uncover which concern they have so you can address it honestly.

Here's what to say instead of "Okay, take your time!":

"I totally understand! Can I ask - what specifically do you want to think about? Is it the investment, the timing, or something about the program itself?"

Then STOP TALKING. Let them fill the silence.

If they say: "The money..."

"I get it - this is an investment. Can I ask what you're currently spending on [supplements/doctor visits/treatments that aren't working]? Sometimes when we add it up, focused coaching actually costs less than continuing down the same path with no results. Does that resonate?"

If they say: "I'm just not sure..."

"What would need to be true for this to feel like a confident yes? What questions can I answer that would help you decide?"

If they say: "I need to check with my partner..."

"Of course! Would it be helpful if we scheduled a quick call with both of you so they can ask any questions? I want you both to feel good about this decision."

If they say: "I want to try on my own first..."

"I completely respect that! Can I ask - what's different about trying now versus the last few times you tried? Most people I work with have already tried on their own multiple times. That's usually why they're looking for support. Does that feel true for you?"

The key is:

❌ Don't let them leave with vague uncertainty ✅ Help them identify their REAL concern ✅ Address it honestly and directly ✅ Give them a clear next step

Remember:

"I need to think about it" is rarely about thinking. It's about fear.

Your job is to help them see that working with you is LESS risky than continuing to struggle alone.

But if after addressing concerns they're still not ready?

That's okay! Some people truly aren't ready, and that's not your failure.

Say this:

"I totally understand! Here's my calendar link - if you decide you're ready in the next few weeks, just book a time. Either way, I'm rooting for you!"

Then let it go and find the people who ARE ready.

30 DAILY COMMUNITY TIPS - WEEK 3 (Days 15-21)



DAY 15 (MONDAY): The Art of Active Listening (Your Secret Weapon)

Hi there! 💕

Want to know the one skill that will make you a better coach than 90% of the coaches out there?

Active listening.

Not fancy certifications. Not knowing every supplement on the market. Not having perfect protocols.

The ability to truly LISTEN.

Here's what usually happens:

Client: "I'm so tired all the time..."

Mediocre coach's brain: "Oh! I know this! It's probably adrenal fatigue and low thyroid! I'll jump in with my advice now!"

Great coach's brain: "Interesting. Let me ask more before assuming. What else is happening for them?"

See the difference?

Most coaches (especially new ones) are so eager to show they know things that they:

Interrupt mid-story

Jump to solutions too fast

Miss important context

Make assumptions

Fail to hear what's NOT being said

Active listening means:

✅ Listening to understand, not to respond ✅ Asking follow-up questions ("Tell me more about that...") ✅ Noticing patterns across what they're sharing ✅ Reflecting back what you're hearing ✅ Making space for silence (people process in silence!) ✅ Reading between the lines (what are they NOT saying?)

Here's how to level up your listening:

1. PAUSE before responding

Count to 3 in your head after they finish talking. Make sure they're actually done.

2. Reflect back what you heard

"So what I'm hearing is... [summarize]. Did I get that right?"

This shows you're listening AND gives them a chance to clarify.

3. Ask open-ended questions

❌ "Do you eat breakfast?" (yes/no answer) ✅ "Tell me about your typical morning routine" (opens conversation)

❌ "Are you stressed?" (yes/no answer) ✅ "What's your stress level like these days?" (invites detail)

4. Notice what they're NOT saying

They talk about physical symptoms but never mention emotions → Maybe emotional health is the real root

They mention their partner a lot but always sound frustrated → Maybe relationship stress is affecting their health

They list 10 things they've tried but dismiss each one quickly → Maybe they're not actually ready to commit to solutions

5. Follow their energy

When their voice changes, their eyes light up, or they get emotional → That's where the gold is. Dig deeper there.

"I notice you got really emotional when you mentioned that. Can you tell me more?"

6. Don't fill every silence

Silence is where people process. Give them space to think. It feels awkward at first, but it's where breakthroughs happen.

7. Take notes

You can't remember everything. Write down key points so you can refer back: "Last week you mentioned your energy crashes at 3pm - how was that this week?"

Questions that unlock deeper insights:

💭 "What else?" (keeps them talking) 💭 "Tell me more about that" (goes deeper) 💭 "What makes you say that?" (uncovers beliefs) 💭 "How does that make you feel?" (adds emotional dimension) 💭 "What have you tried so far?" (reveals patterns) 💭 "What would 'better' look like for you?" (clarifies goals)

Here's what happens when you listen deeply:

✅ Clients feel truly heard (maybe for the first time in their health journey) ✅ You uncover root causes (that surface-level questions would miss) ✅ You build trust faster (people trust those who understand them) ✅ You create better protocols (because you actually know what's going on) ✅ You get better results (because you're addressing the real issues)

Your homework:

In your next conversation (with ANYONE - doesn't have to be a client!), practice listening WITHOUT planning your response while they talk.

Just listen. Be present. Get curious.

Notice how much MORE you hear.

Remember:

Your expertise is valuable. But your presence is priceless.

Listen like their healing depends on it. Because it does.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: What's the hardest part of active listening for you? Do you interrupt? Jump to solutions? Get distracted planning your response?

Be honest below - we ALL struggle with this!



DAY 16 (TUESDAY): When to Refer Out (And Why It's Your Superpower)

Hi there! 💕

Let's talk about something that scares new coaches:

Turning down a potential client.

I know what you're thinking:

"Sarah, I barely have any clients! Why would I turn someone away?"

Because not every client is YOUR client.

And knowing when to refer out is one of the most professional things you can do.

Here's when you NEED to refer out:

1. When they need medical intervention, not coaching:

🚩 Severe eating disorders 🚩 Active suicidal ideation or mental health crisis 🚩 Unexplained rapid weight loss (20+ pounds in a month) 🚩 Severe chronic pain without diagnosis 🚩 Active substance abuse/addiction 🚩 Symptoms requiring immediate medical attention (chest pain, severe bleeding, etc.)

What to say: "Based on what you've shared, I think you need medical evaluation first. I'd be happy to work with you AFTER you've seen [specialist type] and we have medical clearance. Your safety is my top priority."

2. When they want you to replace their doctor:

🚩 "I don't trust doctors, so I'm only working with you" 🚩 "Can you tell me if I should stop my medication?" 🚩 "I need someone to diagnose what's wrong with me"

What to say: "I work alongside your medical team, not instead of them. My role is to support lifestyle changes and wellness education - but you need to maintain care with your physician for medical decisions."

3. When they're not willing to do the work:

🚩 "Just tell me what supplements to take" 🚩 "I don't want to change my diet or lifestyle" 🚩 "Can't you just give me a quick fix?" 🚩 "I'm too busy to do anything between sessions"

What to say: "My approach requires active participation and lifestyle changes. If you're looking for a supplement-only solution, that's not how I work. I want to make sure we're a good fit before we start."

4. When their expectations are unrealistic:

🚩 "I want to cure my autoimmune disease in 2 weeks" 🚩 "I won't follow any of my doctor's advice, but I expect you to fix me" 🚩 "I need to lose 50 pounds by next month for my wedding"

What to say: "I want to be honest about realistic timelines. Based on what you've described, [realistic expectation]. If you're looking for faster results than that, we might not be the right fit."

5. When they're outside your specialty:

🚩 You focus on gut health; they need complex hormone support 🚩 You work with women; they're a man with specific needs 🚩 You specialize in autoimmune; they need diabetes management 🚩 They have a condition you've never worked with and don't feel confident supporting

What to say: "While I could work with you, I think you'd get better results with someone who specializes in [their specific need]. Can I connect you with a colleague who focuses on exactly that?"

Here's the beautiful part:

When you refer out, you: ✅ Protect your boundaries and energy ✅ Maintain professional integrity ✅ Keep your certification safe (stay in scope!) ✅ Build trust (even with people you don't take on) ✅ Create referral relationships with other practitioners ✅ Ensure your clients are the RIGHT clients

The clients you DO take on get better results because you're not stretched thin trying to help everyone.

How to build a referral network:

Connect with other coaches/practitioners in different specialties

Create a "resource list" of professionals you trust

When you refer out, offer to be THEIR referral for your specialty (reciprocity!)

Remember:

Your business won't fail because you said no to wrong-fit clients.

Your business will THRIVE because you said yes to the RIGHT clients and gave them your absolute best.

Need help knowing your scope of practice?

We cover this in-depth in Level 2 - Professional Boundaries & Ethics Training including: ✅ Exactly what's in your scope (and what's not) ✅ How to handle red flag situations ✅ Legal protection strategies ✅ Building your referral network ✅ Sample contracts and liability waivers

Want access? Comment 'BOUNDARIES' below and I'll DM you details.

Refer out with confidence. It's not weakness - it's wisdom.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: Have you ever felt pressured to take on a client who wasn't a good fit? Or turned someone down and felt guilty?

Share your story below - let's normalize setting boundaries!



DAY 17 (WEDNESDAY): Boundaries Are NOT Selfish (They're Essential)

Hi there! 💕

We need to talk about something that trips up SO many new coaches:

Boundaries.

I see this pattern ALL the time:

You give clients your personal cell number "in case they need you"

You answer texts at 10pm because "they're struggling"

You offer extra sessions for free because "they really need help"

You let sessions run 90 minutes when you scheduled 60

You feel guilty taking a day off because "what if someone needs me?"

Let me say this with love:

This is not sustainable. And it's not serving anyone.

Here's what happens when you have no boundaries:

For YOU:

Resentment builds (you're exhausted)

You burn out (coaching stops feeling good)

Your personal life suffers (family time vanishes)

You can't sustain your practice long-term (you quit)

For YOUR CLIENTS:

They don't learn to self-regulate (they become dependent)

They become dependent on you (not empowered)

They don't value your time (you trained them not to)

They don't develop their own coping skills (you're doing the work for them)

Boundaries aren't selfish. They're essential.

Here are non-negotiable boundaries you need:

✅ Session time limits "Our sessions are 60 minutes. If we need more time, we can schedule a follow-up session."

✅ Communication hours "I check messages between 9am-5pm Monday-Friday. If you message outside those hours, I'll respond the next business day."

✅ Emergency protocol "If you're experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 or go to the ER. I'm not able to provide urgent medical care."

✅ Scope of practice "That question falls outside my scope as a health coach. I recommend discussing that with your doctor."

✅ Payment policies "Payment is due before our session. I'm not able to hold sessions with outstanding balances."

✅ Cancellation policy "I need 24 hours notice for cancellations. Late cancellations or no-shows forfeit the session."

"But Sarah, I don't want to seem cold or uncaring!"

Boundaries don't make you cold. They make you PROFESSIONAL.

Would you expect your dentist to answer your call at midnight? Your therapist to work for free? Your hair stylist to take walk-ins during their day off?

No. Because they have boundaries. And you respect them MORE for it.

Your clients will respect you more when you have clear boundaries.

They'll:

Show up on time

Do the work between sessions

Value your expertise

Take responsibility for their healing

Get better results (because they're empowered, not dependent)

How to communicate boundaries with warmth:

"I care so much about your progress! To give you my best, I need to maintain clear boundaries around our work together. Here's how we'll communicate... [explain boundaries]. Does this work for you?"

If a client pushes back on boundaries?

That's a red flag. They're not the right client for you.

Remember:

You can't pour from an empty cup. You can't help anyone if you're burnt out. You can't sustain a practice if you're working unsustainable hours.

Boundaries protect:

Your energy (so you can show up fully)

Your family time (so you have a life outside coaching)

Your mental health (so you don't resent your work)

Your passion (so coaching stays joyful)

Your ability to serve long-term (so you're still doing this in 10 years)

Set them clearly. Hold them lovingly. Never apologize for them.

Your future self will thank you.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: What boundary do you struggle with most? Saying no? Not answering texts at night? Letting sessions run over?

Drop it below - let's support each other in getting better at this!

And if you HAVE a boundary you hold firmly, share it! Inspire the rest of us!



DAY 18 (THURSDAY): The Power of "I Don't Know" (And How to Say It With Confidence)

Hi! 💕

Can I tell you about one of the most liberating moments in my coaching career?

The day I said "I don't know" to a client and didn't die of shame.

Here's what happened:

A client asked me a detailed question about methylation pathways and MTHFR gene variants. I knew some things about it, but not enough to answer confidently.

Old me would have:

Panicked internally

Fumbled through a half-informed answer

Googled frantically mid-session

Felt like a complete fraud afterward

New me said:

"That's a really great question, and I want to give you an accurate answer rather than guessing. Let me research that thoroughly and get back to you by tomorrow with some solid resources. In the meantime, here's what I DO know about..."

You know what happened?

My client said: "I really appreciate your honesty! So many people just make stuff up."

Mind. Blown.

Here's what I learned:

Saying "I don't know" doesn't make you look incompetent.

It makes you look: ✅ Honest (clients value this more than you think) ✅ Ethical (you're not making stuff up) ✅ Professional (you know your limits) ✅ Trustworthy (they can rely on what you DO say) ✅ Committed to accuracy (their safety matters more than your ego)

What DOES make you look incompetent?

Making up answers you're unsure about. Confidently stating things you only half-remember. Giving advice outside your expertise.

The truth is:

Functional medicine is VAST. Nobody knows everything. Not me. Not doctors. Not researchers with PhDs. Nobody.

Your job isn't to be a walking encyclopedia.

Your job is to:

Know your scope and stay within it

Have frameworks for investigation

Know when to research further

Know when to refer out

Be honest about the limits of your knowledge

The magic phrase:

"I don't know the answer to that, but let me find out and get back to you."

Variations you can use:

"That's outside my area of expertise. Let me connect you with someone who specializes in that."

"Great question! I want to give you accurate information, so let me research that and follow up by [specific time]."

"I have some ideas, but I'd want to confirm before advising. Can we table this and I'll come prepared to our next session?"

"I don't feel confident answering that without more information. Can you ask your doctor and then we can discuss their recommendations?"

When you say "I don't know," you're not showing weakness.

You're showing:

Integrity (honesty over ego)

Professionalism (knowing your limits)

Respect for your client (their safety &gt; your pride)

Commitment to quality (accuracy matters)

Confidence in what you DO know (secure enough to admit what you don't)

Your clients aren't hiring you to be omniscient.

They're hiring you to:

Care deeply about their wellbeing

Guide them with what you know

Research what you don't

Refer out when appropriate

Walk alongside them in their healing journey

You can do all of that while also saying "I don't know" sometimes.

In fact, you MUST do all of that while also saying "I don't know" sometimes.

Embrace the power of "I don't know."

It's not a weakness. It's a superpower.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: What's a question you're terrified a client will ask because you don't know the answer?

Drop it below - let's normalize not knowing everything! And maybe someone here actually DOES know the answer and can help! 😊



DAY 19 (FRIDAY - FREEBIE DAY): The Complete Objection Handler Script

🎁 FREEBIE FRIDAY 🎁

Hi there! 💕

It's Friday, which means it's time for this week's premium resource!

Last week you got: Client Onboarding Email Scripts This week: The Complete Objection Handler

Picture this:

You just had a GREAT discovery call. They loved everything. You shared your program. You stated your price.

Then they say:

"That's more than I expected..."

"I need to think about it..."

"Can I do a payment plan?"

"My partner handles the money..."

"I want to try on my own first..."

And you freeze. Your confidence crumbles. You backtrack. You discount. You lose the client.

Most coaches give up after the first objection.

Professional coaches know: Objections are just questions in disguise.

THIS WEEK'S FREEBIE: The Complete Objection Handler Script

This 8-page PDF includes word-for-word responses to:

💬 "That's too expensive" / "I can't afford it" 💬 "I need to think about it" 💬 "I need to talk to my partner" 💬 "Can you do a discount?" 💬 "I want to try on my own first" 💬 "I'm not sure it will work for me" 💬 "Can I just do one session and see?" 💬 "I don't have time right now" 💬 "I need to wait until [future date]" 💬 "I've tried coaching before and it didn't work"

PLUS: ✅ How to uncover the REAL objection (it's usually not what they first say) ✅ When to push gently vs. when to let them go ✅ Follow-up scripts for people who said "not now" ✅ How to offer payment plans without devaluing your work ✅ What to do when they ghost after saying yes

These are the exact scripts I use and teach to students who now close 60-80% of their discovery calls.

No guessing. No panic. Just copy-paste confidence.

DAY 20 (SATURDAY): Building a Sustainable Practice (Not a Burnout Factory)

Hi there! 💕

Let's talk about something really important:

Building a coaching practice that doesn't destroy your life.

Because here's what I see happen ALL THE TIME:

Phase 1: Excited beginner

Takes on every client who shows interest

Works nights and weekends

Answers messages at all hours

Feels energized by helping people

Phase 2: Busy but stressed

Client schedule is packed back-to-back

Personal time disappears

Quality of coaching starts slipping

Still telling yourself "This is just temporary"

Phase 3: Burnt the F* out**

Resentment builds toward clients

Your own health suffers

Relationships strain

You question whether coaching is sustainable

You consider quitting entirely

Sound familiar?

Here's what nobody tells you:

A "successful" practice that burns you out ISN'T successful.

Sustainability matters more than size.

Here's how to build a practice that lasts:

1. Cap your client load

Most coaches can effectively handle:

8-12 individual clients at a time (if seeing weekly)

15-20 if seeing bi-weekly

More if you add group programs

Know your limit. Then stay BELOW it.

Why? You need buffer room for:

Life emergencies

Admin time and prep

Continuing education

Sick days

Vacations

Your own health appointments

2. Charge enough to work LESS, not more

Bad math: 20 clients × $100 = $2,000/month (exhausting!) Good math: 8 clients × $300 = $2,400/month (sustainable!)

Which scenario lets you deliver better care?

The one where you have fewer clients paying more.

3. Build in white space

Don't book back-to-back-to-back sessions.

Your schedule should look like:

9:00-10:00 → Client session 10:00-10:30 → Break / Notes / Admin 10:30-11:30 → Client session 11:30-12:30 → Lunch (actual food, not "working lunch") 12:30-1:30 → Client session 1:30-2:00 → Break / Walk / Breathe 2:00-3:00 → Admin / Prep / Research

NOT like this:

9:00-10:00 → Client 10:00-11:00 → Client 11:00-12:00 → Client 12:00-1:00 → Client 1:00-2:00 → Client 2:00-3:00 → Client (then collapse)

You are not a machine.

4. Protect your non-working time

✅ No sessions on weekends (except rare exceptions) ✅ No client communication after 6pm ✅ One full day off per week (minimum!) ✅ Actual vacations where you UNPLUG

"But what if clients need me?!"

They can wait until Monday. Trust me. The world won't end.

5. Diversify your income streams

Don't rely solely on 1:1 coaching:

💰 Group programs (leverage your time - help 10 people at once) 💰 Digital products (passive income - create once, sell forever) 💰 Workshops/webinars (one-to-many teaching) 💰 Affiliate partnerships (ethical ones that serve your audience)

This gives you:

More income with less time

Flexibility if you need to reduce 1:1 load

Multiple revenue sources (safety net)

6. Take care of YOUR health first

You cannot pour from an empty cup.

Non-negotiables: ✅ Sleep 7-8 hours (model what you preach!) ✅ Move your body regularly ✅ Eat nourishing food ✅ Have hobbies outside coaching ✅ Maintain relationships ✅ Get your own support (therapy, coaching, whatever you need)

If you're giving health advice while ignoring your own health, something's wrong.

7. Regularly evaluate and adjust

Every quarter, ask yourself:

Do I still enjoy this work?

Am I making enough money?

Is my schedule sustainable?

Am I growing or just surviving?

What needs to change?

Then make the changes. Don't wait for a breakdown.

Remember:

A sustainable practice means: ✅ You love Monday mornings (not dread them) ✅ You have energy for your clients (not resentment) ✅ You have a life outside your business ✅ You're still doing this 5, 10, 20 years from now

That's the goal.

Not "hustling harder." Not "grinding it out." Not "sacrificing everything for success."

Build something that nourishes you, not depletes you.

Your future self will thank you.

Sarah 💕

💬 YOUR TURN: What's ONE boundary you're committing to for sustainability?

Examples:

"No sessions after 5pm"

"Sundays are completely off"

"Max 10 clients at a time"

"I'm taking a real lunch break"

DAY 22 (MONDAY): Why Continuing Education Is Non-Negotiable

Hi! 💕

Let me ask you something:

Now that you're certified, are you done learning?

If you answered yes... we need to talk.

Here's the truth:

The day you stop learning is the day you stop being an effective coach.

Why?

✅ Science evolves - What we knew about gut health 5 years ago has changed dramatically ✅ Your clients evolve - They'll bring you cases you've never seen before ✅ You evolve - Your skills and interests will deepen and shift over time ✅ The field advances - New research, new protocols, new understanding constantly emerges

The best coaches are perpetual students.

Here's what continuing education looks like:

1. Reading (books, studies, articles)

Follow functional medicine practitioners on social media

Read books by experts in your niche

Stay current on research (even if it's just reading abstracts)

Join professional groups and forums

2. Advanced training/certifications

After mastering foundational skills, consider specializing:

Hormone health deep-dives

Gut-brain connection

Autoimmune protocols

SIBO/IBS specialization

Mold toxicity

Nervous system regulation

Trauma-informed coaching

3. Peer learning

Join mastermind groups with other coaches

Attend conferences (virtual or in-person)

Case study reviews with colleagues

Mentorship (being mentored AND mentoring others)

4. Client-driven learning

Every challenging client case is an opportunity:

Research conditions you're unfamiliar with

Consult with other practitioners

Learn from what works (and what doesn't)

Document patterns you notice

"But Sarah, I'm overwhelmed just trying to get clients! I don't have time to study more!"

I get it. But here's the thing:

Continuing education doesn't have to be a huge time commitment.

Start small:

📚 15 minutes/day reading one article or book chapter 🎧 Podcast during commute (functional medicine, coaching skills, business growth) 💻 1 webinar/month on a topic related to your niche 👥 1 peer conversation/week discussing cases and learning together

This compounds over time.

In one year, you'll have:

Read 12+ books or 365 articles

Listened to 250+ hours of expert content

Attended 12 professional trainings

Discussed 52 cases with peers

That's MASSIVE growth.

Why this matters for your business:

The more you know: ✅ The more confident you feel (imposter syndrome shrinks) ✅ The more complex cases you can handle (bigger impact) ✅ The more you can charge (expertise = premium pricing) ✅ The better results your clients get (which means more referrals) ✅ The more satisfied you feel (mastery is fulfilling)

DAY 23 (TUESDAY): Your First Testimonial Matters More Than You Think

Hi there! 💕

Let's talk about testimonials.

Specifically, let's talk about how ONE great testimonial can change your entire business.

Here's what I see new coaches do:

They get amazing results with a client, feel great about it, and then... never ask for a testimonial.

Why?

"It feels awkward"

"I don't want to bother them"

"They'll leave one if they want to"

"I'll ask later"

Then "later" never comes, and you have zero social proof to show potential clients.

Meanwhile, your ideal client is thinking:

"This sounds great, but has she actually helped anyone? I don't see any testimonials..."

And they scroll on.

Here's the truth:

People don't buy coaching because of your credentials. They buy because of proof that you get results.

Testimonials ARE that proof.

How to ask for a testimonial (without feeling weird):

Option 1: During your final session

"[Name], it's been incredible watching your transformation from [specific before state] to [specific after state]! I'd love to share your success story to help other women who are struggling like you were. Would you be comfortable writing a short testimonial about your experience working with me?"

Option 2: Via email after your work together ends

Subject: You're amazing! (and I need a favor)

"Hi [Name]!

I'm so proud of everything you accomplished during our time together - you went from [specific struggles] to [specific victories]!

Would you be willing to write a short testimonial about your experience? It would mean the world to me and would help other women who are where you were find the support they need.

Specifically, it would be helpful if you could share:

What you were struggling with before we started

What changed during our work together

How you feel now

No pressure at all - but if you're open to it, I'd be so grateful!

Thank you for trusting me with your health journey!

With gratitude, Sarah"

Option 3: Make it even easier with prompts

"If it helps, here are some questions you could answer:

What was your biggest health challenge before working with me?

What made you decide to invest in coaching?

What surprised you most about the process?

What results did you experience?

Would you recommend working with me? Why?

Feel free to answer whichever questions resonate - I'll turn it into a testimonial!"

What makes a GREAT testimonial:

✅ Specific results "I reduced my bloating by 80%, started sleeping through the night, and lost 15 pounds" vs. "I feel better"

✅ Emotional transformation "I finally feel like myself again" / "I have hope for the first time in years"

✅ Before & after contrast "I went from exhausted and foggy to energized and clear-headed"

✅ Overcoming skepticism "I was skeptical at first because I'd tried everything, but Sarah really got to the root of what was going on"

Pro tips:

📸 Ask for a photo! Testimonials with photos perform 300% better than text alone.

📝 Get it in writing Voice notes or verbal feedback are great, but you need written permission to use it publicly.

✍️ Offer to write it for them "I know you're busy - would it help if I drafted something based on our conversations and you can edit it?"

Want my complete Testimonial Collection System?

I have a step-by-step guide that includes: ✅ Email templates for requesting testimonials ✅ How to turn casual feedback into powerful testimonials ✅ Permission forms (legal protection) ✅ Where and how to display testimonials ✅ How to turn testimonials into case studies

It's inside the Business Mastery section of All-In-One Access.

Want access? Comment 'TESTIMONIALS' below and I'll DM you details.

Your action step:

If you've worked with ANYONE (paid or free pilot), reach out TODAY and ask for a testimonial.

Even if it's your mom. Even if you didn't charge them. Even if it feels uncomfortable.

Your first testimonial leads to your second client. Your second testimonial leads to your fifth client. Your fifth testimonial leads to being fully booked.

Start collecting proof today.

You've got this! Sarah 💕

DAY 24 (WEDNESDAY): The Referral Script That Actually Works

Hi! 💕

Let's talk about the fastest way to get new clients:

Referrals from happy clients.

But here's where most new coaches struggle:

They're too shy/awkward to actually ASK for referrals!

Sound familiar?

You've just helped someone transform their health. They're thrilled. They're grateful. They're telling everyone about you.

But you never actually ask them to refer people... so they don't (intentionally).

Why?

Because you're thinking: "I don't want to seem pushy... they'll refer people if they want to... I don't want to make it awkward..."

Let me fix this for you.

Here's the exact script that works:

After getting great results with a client, say this:

"[Name], I'm so thrilled with your progress! Watching you go from [before state] to [current state] has been incredible.

I have a small favor to ask - I'm currently accepting [X] new clients this month. If you know anyone who's struggling with [similar issue] and might benefit from support like you received, I'd be so grateful if you'd send them my way.

Who comes to mind when you think about people in your life who are dealing with [symptoms/issues]?"

Then STOP TALKING. Wait for them to think.

What usually happens:

"Oh my gosh, YES! My friend Sarah has been struggling with the exact same thing! Can I give her your info?"

BOOM. Referral.

Why this works:

✅ You're asking for help (people love to help people they like) ✅ You're being specific about WHO you want (makes it easier for them) ✅ You're prompting them to think of actual people (not leaving it vague like "if you know anyone...") ✅ You're making it easy (they just send your info)

Alternative version for introverts:

"I'm so grateful I got to support you through this transformation! If you know anyone who might benefit from similar support, I'd love if you'd share my info. Here's my calendar link - feel free to pass it along to anyone who comes to mind!"

Pro tip:

Make it EASY for them to refer. Give them:

Your calendar/booking link

A one-sentence description they can copy/paste

Your digital business card or contact info

Example:

"Here's what you can say: 'I just worked with Sarah, a functional medicine coach who helped me finally figure out my gut issues. She's amazing and taking new clients! Here's her link: [calendar link]'"

The truth?

Happy clients WANT to refer people. They just need:

Permission (you asking makes it okay)

Prompting (helps them think of who specifically)

Easy action (give them exactly what to share)

Give them all three, and watch your practice fill up!

Your homework:

Think about your last successful client (or pilot).

This week, reach out and use this script. Even if they finished working with you months ago. Even if it feels scary.

One referral conversation could lead to your next 3 clients.

Ask for those referrals! Sarah ✨

💬 YOUR TURN: Have you ever asked for a referral? What happened?

If you haven't yet, what's stopping you? Drop your fear below - let's work through it together!

And if you HAVE successfully gotten referrals, share your story! Inspire the rest of us!



DAY 25 (THURSDAY): The Truth About Comparison (It's Stealing Your Joy)

Hi there! 💕

Let me guess what happened today:

You were feeling pretty good about your coaching journey. Then you opened Instagram.

You saw:

Coach A with 10K followers announcing her "sold-out program"

Coach B posting her "$20K month" income screenshot

Coach C with her glossy brand photoshoot and perfect website

Coach D celebrating her 50th client testimonial

And suddenly you felt... small.

"Why am I so far behind?" "I'll never be that successful" "Maybe I'm not cut out for this"

Sound familiar?

Let me tell you something really important:

You're comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel.

Here's what you DON'T see:

👉 Coach A bought most of those followers and has 3 actual clients 👉 Coach B is showing revenue (not profit) and is $15K in debt from ads 👉 Coach C is miserable, burnt out, and questioning everything despite looking perfect 👉 Coach D has been coaching for 5 years (but doesn't mention that part in her post)

I'm not saying this to tear anyone down.

I'm saying it to show you: Social media is not reality.

The coaches you're comparing yourself to?

They're comparing themselves to someone else too.

Here's what actually matters:

✅ Are you helping people? (Even one person counts) ✅ Are you learning and growing? (Every day you're better than yesterday) ✅ Are you staying true to your values? (Integrity &gt; income) ✅ Are you making progress? (Even if it's slow) ✅ Are you proud of the work you're doing? (This is YOUR journey)

If yes to any of those, you're succeeding.

Your timeline is YOUR timeline.

Some coaches:

Get 10 clients in month 1 (usually because they already had an audience)

Take 6 months to get their first client (completely normal!)

Build slowly and sustainably (tortoise wins the race)

Explode fast but burn out within a year

None of these paths is "right" or "wrong."

What's right is what's right for YOU.

Here's your homework:

Every time you catch yourself comparing, ask:

1. "What am I actually jealous of?" Their income? Their confidence? Their client roster? Their visibility?

2. "What action can I take toward that goal?" Instead of scrolling and feeling bad, DO something productive.

3. "What am I grateful for in MY journey?" Refocus on your own wins, however small.

Pro tip:

If certain accounts make you feel consistently bad about yourself, unfollow them.

Your mental health matters more than keeping up with what everyone else is doing.

Your peace &gt; their highlight reel.

Remember:

The only person you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday.

Are you:

More confident than last month?

More skilled than last week?

Closer to your goals than yesterday?

If yes, you're winning.

Stop measuring your Chapter 1 against someone else's Chapter 20.

Your story is unfolding exactly as it should.

Stay in your lane. Trust your pace. Your journey is yours.

Sarah 💕

P.S. - That coach you're jealous of? She's probably jealous of something YOU have. We're all human. We all struggle. Even the "successful" ones.

💬 YOUR TURN: Who do you compare yourself to? (You don't have to name them!)

DAY 27 (SATURDAY): How to Handle Clients Who Don't Do the Work

Hi there! 💕

Okay, real talk time.

You're going to have clients who:

Don't complete their action steps

Show up to sessions unprepared

Make excuses every single week

Expect results without putting in effort

And it's going to frustrate the hell out of you.

Here's what usually happens:

Week 1: You give them homework. They don't do it. Week 2: You give them homework again. They don't do it. Week 3: You feel like a failure. "Am I not explaining it well enough?" Week 4: You're working harder than they are. You're exhausted.

STOP.

Here's what you need to understand:

You cannot want their transformation more than they do.

Let me say it louder for the coaches in the back:

YOU CANNOT WANT THEIR TRANSFORMATION MORE THAN THEY DO.

Your job is to: ✅ Provide expert guidance ✅ Create clear, doable action plans ✅ Hold space for their struggles ✅ Offer accountability with compassion

Your job is NOT to: ❌ Force them to do the work ❌ Make excuses for why they're not showing up ❌ Carry the responsibility for their results ❌ Work harder than they do

So what do you do when a client isn't doing the work?

Step 1: Name it directly (with compassion)

"I'm noticing a pattern - for the last 3 weeks you've mentioned you didn't complete the action steps we agreed on. What's going on?"

Then LISTEN.

Sometimes there are legitimate barriers:

Unexpected life crisis (death, divorce, job loss)

Overwhelming action steps (you gave them too much)

Missing resources or skills (they don't know HOW)

Mental health challenges (depression, anxiety)

If that's the case, adjust the plan. Make it simpler. Break it down. Provide more support.

But sometimes the answer is:

"I just didn't get around to it" "I was too busy" "I forgot"

Step 2: Clarify commitment

"I want to make sure we're on the same page. My role is to guide you, but the actual work of transformation happens between our sessions when you implement what we discuss. Are you committed to making these changes?"

If yes → "Great! Let's figure out what support you need to actually follow through. What would make this easier?"

If they hedge → "It sounds like maybe now isn't the right time for you to be doing this work. Would it make sense to pause our sessions and revisit this when you're ready to prioritize it?"

Step 3: Set a boundary

"I'm deeply invested in your success, but I can't do the work for you. If you're not able to complete action steps between sessions, we're not going to see the results you want. I need to see consistent effort for us to continue working together effectively."

This isn't mean. It's honest.

Here's the hard truth:

Not every client is ready for transformation, even if they say they are.

And that's NOT your failure.

Some people:

Want a magic pill, not lifestyle change

Need to complain more than they need to change

Aren't ready to let go of their identity as "the sick one"

Have secondary gains from staying stuck (attention, avoiding responsibility, etc.)

You can't save people who don't want to be saved.

What you CAN do:

✅ Be honest about what's required for results ✅ Hold boundaries around what you will/won't tolerate ✅ Release clients who consistently don't show up ✅ Focus your energy on clients who DO the work

Remember:

The clients who DO show up, DO the work, and DO transform?

They're proof that your methods work.

The clients who don't? They're just proof that not everyone is ready.

And that's okay. It's not about you.

Need support navigating difficult client situations?

We handle this in our monthly Group Coaching Calls where I help you with: ✅ How to have hard conversations with clients ✅ When to fire a client (yes, sometimes you should) ✅ Setting boundaries without guilt ✅ Not taking their lack of effort personally

Included with All-In-One Access.

Want in? Comment 'COACHING' below and I'll send details.

Hold your standards high! Sarah 💕

30 DAILY COMMUNITY TIPS - FINAL DAYS (Days 29-30)



DAY 29 (MONDAY): You're Ready (Even If You Don't Feel Like It)

Hi there! 💕

We've reached Day 29.

Twenty-nine days of tips, insights, mindset shifts, and practical strategies.

And if I had to guess, you're probably feeling one of two ways right now:

Option 1: "I'm SO ready! Let's do this!"

Amazing. Go get 'em! You're about to change lives.

Option 2: "I still don't feel ready. I need to learn more / prepare more / be more before I start."

If you're Option 2, this message is for you.

Here's what I need you to understand:

You will NEVER feel 100% ready.

Never.

Not after your certification. Not after reading 10 more books. Not after watching 50 more webinars. Not after perfectly organizing all your systems. Not after building the perfect website. Not after having all the answers.

You know when you'll feel ready?

After you've helped your first client and realized you survived it.

Because that's when you'll discover:

You DO know enough (and you can research what you don't)

You CAN handle the hard questions (or say "I don't know" with confidence)

You ARE capable of guiding transformation (your heart matters more than perfection)

Clients DON'T expect perfection (they expect presence and care)

Your commitment matters more than your credentials

Every single coach who's now thriving had the same fear you have right now.

Every. Single. One.

"What if I'm not ready?" "What if I mess up?" "What if I don't know enough?" "What if I fail them?"

You know what they did?

They started anyway.

And you know what happened?

They figured it out as they went

They learned from every client interaction

They grew their confidence through ACTION (not more studying)

They became the coach they are today

Not by waiting. By DOING.

Here's what's actually true RIGHT NOW:

✅ You've completed a comprehensive certification ✅ You have frameworks and protocols to work from ✅ You know how to research what you don't know ✅ You understand when to refer out (scope of practice) ✅ You genuinely care about helping people ✅ You've been showing up here for 29 days learning and growing

That's enough to start.

You don't need to know everything. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to show up, give your best, and keep learning.

So here's my challenge to you:

In the next 7 days, do ONE of these things:

Post your transformation story on social media and offer 3 free discovery calls

Tell 5 people in your life that you're now a certified coach and what you do

Reach out to 3 potential pilot clients and offer your program

Join a health-related Facebook group and offer genuine value (answer questions, support people)

Update all your social bios to say "Certified Integrative Health Coach"

Send the referral script to your last 3 satisfied clients/pilots

Book your first discovery call with someone who's been asking you health questions

Just ONE. Pick the one that scares you least and DO IT.

Take ONE action that moves you from "preparing" to "practicing."

Because here's the truth:

Your future clients don't need you to be perfect.

They need you to be present. They need you to care. They need you to show up.

And they're waiting for you RIGHT NOW.

The woman who's been dismissed by 5 doctors... The man who's exhausted and has tried everything... The mom who's desperate to feel like herself again...

They don't need a perfect coach with every answer.

They need YOUR compassion, YOUR story, YOUR willingness to walk alongside them.

That person you were before you started this journey?

The one who was struggling, confused, searching for answers, feeling dismissed and alone?

Someone out there is that person RIGHT NOW.

And you're the one who can help them.

So stop waiting for "ready."

Start being brave.
