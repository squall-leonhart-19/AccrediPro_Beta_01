## Functional Medicine Practitioner Certification Readiness Assessment

**Instructions:** Answer all 10 questions. You need 70% (7/10) to pass and unlock your results.

---

### Question 1 (Module 1)
**What percentage of Americans currently have at least one chronic disease?**

- A) 40%
- B) 50%
- C) 60% ✓
- D) 70%

> **Correct Answer: C) 60%**
> 
> 60% of Americans have at least one chronic disease, and 40% have two or more. This epidemic is driven by a healthcare system designed for acute care, not chronic disease management.

### Question 2 (Module 1)
**In Functional Medicine, what does "Sick Care" refer to?**

- A) Emergency room treatment
- B) Traditional medicine that suppresses symptoms without addressing root causes ✓
- C) Care for terminally ill patients
- D) Preventive health screenings

> **Correct Answer: B) Traditional medicine that suppresses symptoms without addressing root causes**
> 
> "Sick Care" is the term used to describe the conventional medical model that asks "what are your symptoms?" and prescribes treatments to suppress those symptoms—without ever asking "why" the person is unwell.

### Question 3 (Module 1)
**Which body system produces 90% of your serotonin (the "happiness" chemical)?**

- A) Brain
- B) Gut ✓
- C) Adrenal glands
- D) Thyroid

> **Correct Answer: B) Gut**
> 
> The gut produces 90% of your serotonin and houses 70-80% of your immune system. This is why Functional Medicine always starts with gut health—it's the foundation of both mental and physical wellbeing.

---

### Question 4 (Module 2)
**How many patients did Michelle typically see per shift as a hospital nurse?**

- A) 10 patients
- B) 20 patients
- C) 30 patients ✓
- D) 40 patients

> **Correct Answer: C) 30 patients**
> 
> Michelle described seeing 30 patients per shift, with only 7 minutes (sometimes 5) per person. This impossible patient load is a key driver of moral injury in healthcare workers.

---

### Question 5 (Module 2)
**What was the root cause of Susan's 10-year migraine condition?**

- A) Genetic predisposition to migraines
- B) Chronic inflammation from grief-induced stress and antibiotic-damaged gut ✓
- C) Undiagnosed brain tumor
- D) Caffeine addiction

> **Correct Answer: B) Chronic inflammation from grief-induced stress and antibiotic-damaged gut**
> 
> Susan's migraines weren't a "brain problem"—they were the end result of systemic inflammation triggered by her mother's death (grief/stress) combined with antibiotics destroying her gut microbiome.

---

### Question 6 (Module 2)
**How long did it take for Susan to experience significant improvement in her migraines after working with Michelle?**

- A) 1 week
- B) 3 weeks ✓
- C) 3 months
- D) 6 months

> **Correct Answer: B) 3 weeks**
> 
> Three weeks after starting Michelle's protocol (gut repair, stress support, anti-inflammatory nutrition), Susan texted: "I haven't had a headache in 7 days." This demonstrated the power of addressing root causes.

---

### Question 7 (Module 3)
**What are the three key elements of the Functional Timeline?**

- A) Symptoms, Labs, Diagnosis
- B) Antecedents, Triggers, Mediators ✓
- C) Past, Present, Future
- D) Genetics, Environment, Lifestyle

> **Correct Answer: B) Antecedents, Triggers, Mediators**
> 
> The Functional Timeline organizes health history into Antecedents (predisposing factors), Triggers (the spark that initiated illness), and Mediators (factors that perpetuate the disease). This framework reveals connections invisible to symptom-focused medicine.

---

### Question 8 (Module 3)
**What are "Mediators" in the Functional Timeline framework?**

- A) Genetic predispositions inherited from parents
- B) The specific event that initiated the disease
- C) Factors that perpetuate the disease and keep you sick ✓
- D) Medications prescribed by doctors

> **Correct Answer: C) Factors that perpetuate the disease and keep you sick**
> 
> Mediators are the "logs on the fire"—factors like poor diet, chronic stress, inadequate sleep, or toxin exposure that keep the disease process active even after the trigger is gone. Remove them, and the body can finally heal.

---

### Question 9 (Module 1 + 2)
**What is the typical hourly rate range for trained Functional Medicine practitioners?**

- A) $25-50/hour
- B) $50-75/hour
- C) $100-300/hour ✓
- D) $400-600/hour

> **Correct Answer: C) $100-300/hour**
> 
> Trained Functional Medicine practitioners typically charge $100-300/hour, with 3-month programs ranging from $1,000-$3,000+. This represents a significant income opportunity while working fewer hours than traditional healthcare roles.

---

### Question 10 (Module 3)
**What is the "magic question" that forms the foundation of the Functional Timeline approach?**

- A) "What medications are you currently taking?"
- B) "What are your symptoms today?"
- C) "When was the last time you felt truly healthy—and what happened next?" ✓
- D) "Do you have health insurance?"

> **Correct Answer: C) "When was the last time you felt truly healthy—and what happened next?"**
> 
> This question shifts the focus from current symptoms to the patient's full health story. It helps identify the trigger that initiated the illness and reveals the timeline of events conventional medicine ignores.
