    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Sarah.</strong></p>

    <p>And if you're reading this right now, I'm going to guess something about you.</p>

    <p>I'm going to guess that you're tired. Not just "didn't get enough sleep" tired. I mean <mark
            style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;">soul-tired</mark>.</p>

    <p>Maybe you've been working in the medical system for 15, 20, even 25 years. You went into nursing—or medicine, or
        therapy—because you genuinely wanted to <mark style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;">help
            people</mark>. You had this vision of what healing looked like. You imagined having time with patients.
        Listening to them. Understanding their stories. Making a real difference in their lives.</p>

    <p>But somewhere along the way, that vision got crushed.</p>

    <p>Instead of healing, you found yourself managing. Managing symptoms. Managing paperwork. Managing impossible
        patient loads and unrealistic expectations from administrators who have never touched a patient in their lives.
    </p>

    <p>You started to notice something that broke your heart: <mark
            style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;"><strong>Your patients weren't getting
                better.</strong></mark></p>

    <p>They'd come in with fatigue, and you'd run labs. "Normal." They'd come in with brain fog, digestive issues,
        anxiety, weight they couldn't lose. And the answer was always the same: another prescription. Another 7-minute
        appointment. Another band-aid on a wound that needed surgery.</p>

    <p>You saw the same faces, month after month, year after year. And you started to feel something you never expected
        to feel in a "helping profession":</p>

    <div
        style="background-color: #722F37; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0; text-align: center;">
        <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin: 0;"><strong>Moral Injury</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>That's the clinical term for what happens when you're forced to act against your own values. When you KNOW
        there's a better way, but the system won't let you pursue it. When you're complicit in a healthcare model that's
        failing the very people you swore to help.</p>

    <p>If any of this resonates with you—if you've ever sat in your car after a shift and wondered <em>"Is this really
            it?"</em>—then this lesson is going to change everything.</p>

    <!-- The Crisis -->
    <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin-top: 40px;">The State of American Health</h3>

    <p>Let me share some numbers with you. These aren't opinions—they're facts.</p>

    <div
        style="background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0; border-left: 4px solid #722F37;">
        <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li style="padding: 8px 0;"><mark style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;"><strong>60% of
                        Americans</strong></mark> have at least one chronic disease</li>
            <li style="padding: 8px 0;"><mark style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;"><strong>40% have two
                        or more</strong></mark> chronic conditions</li>
            <li style="padding: 8px 0;"><strong>$4.1 trillion</strong> is spent annually on healthcare—yet outcomes are
                getting worse</li>
            <li style="padding: 8px 0;">The United States ranks <mark
                    style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;"><strong>last</strong></mark> among developed
                nations in healthcare outcomes</li>
            <li style="padding: 8px 0;">Average doctor visit: <mark
                    style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;"><strong>7 minutes</strong></mark></li>
            <li style="padding: 8px 0;">Average time to get diagnosed with autoimmune disease: <strong>4.5
                    years</strong> and <strong>5 doctors</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Read those numbers again. We spend more money on healthcare than any country in the world, and we are <mark
            style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;">LAST in outcomes</mark>. We are sicker than ever
        before.</p>

    <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

    <p>Because modern medicine was designed for <mark style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;">acute
            care</mark>—not chronic disease.</p>

    <p>If you break your leg, go to the ER. They are brilliant at that. If you're having a heart attack, they will save
        your life. Modern medicine excels at crisis intervention.</p>

    <p>But for the 60% of Americans dealing with chronic illness? For the women suffering from:</p>

                style="position: absolute; left: 0;">•</span> Brain fog that makes them feel like they're losing their
            minds</li>

                style="position: absolute; left: 0;">•</span> Digestive issues that have no clear diagnosis</li>
        <li style="padding: 8px 0; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;"><span
                style="position: absolute; left: 0;">•</span> Hormonal chaos—PMS, perimenopause, irregular cycles</li>
        <li style="padding: 8px 0; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;"><span
                style="position: absolute; left: 0;">•</span> Weight that won't budge no matter what they try</li>
        <li style="padding: 8px 0; padding-left: 25px; position: relative;"><span
                style="position: absolute; left: 0;">•</span> Anxiety and depression that antidepressants don't fully
            address</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For these women, the system has nothing to offer but <mark
            style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;">symptom suppression</mark>.</p>

    <p>"Here's a pill for the pain."<br>
        "Here's something for the anxiety."<br>
        "Your labs are normal—it's probably stress."</p>

    <div
        style="background-color: #fff3e0; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800;">
        <p style="color: #e65100; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0;">This is not healthcare. This is "Sick
            Care."</p>
    </div>

    <p><mark style="background-color: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 4px;">Sick Care</mark> doesn't ask <em>why</em> you're
        unwell. It only asks <em>what</em> you're feeling—so it can prescribe something to suppress that feeling.</p>

    <p>The underlying cause? Still there. Growing. Festering. Until the next symptom appears. And then the next
        prescription.</p>

    <p>This is why your patients aren't getting better. This is why YOU feel depleted. Because you're trapped in a
        system that was never designed to heal.</p>
