    <div class="connection-box">
        <h3>🔗 Connection to Your Practice</h3>
        <p>You've defined who you serve. Now we address the practical question every coach faces: <span class="highlight">What exactly do you offer, and what do you charge?</span> Your package structure and pricing directly impact client results, practice sustainability, and your professional fulfillment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="objectives-box">
        <h3>🎯 Learning Objectives</h3>
        <p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand why package-based coaching outperforms session-by-session</li>
            <li>Design coaching packages that create optimal client outcomes</li>
            <li>Price your services based on value and sustainability</li>
            <li>Present pricing with confidence and handle price objections</li>
            <li>Develop multiple offerings for different client needs</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="story-box">
        <h3>📖 Coaching Story: Lisa's Pricing Journey</h3>
        <p>When Lisa started coaching, she charged $75 per session and let clients book whenever they wanted. She was busy but perpetually broke, with clients who would come once, skip three weeks, then return—making real progress impossible.</p>
        <p>When she shifted to a 3-month package at $1,800 ($150/session equivalent, biweekly meetings, plus email support), everything changed. Clients committed. They showed up consistently. They got results. Lisa's income stabilized, and she worked fewer hours.</p>
        <p>"I was afraid to raise prices," Lisa admitted. "But my clients actually thank me now. They say the commitment made them take it seriously."</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666;">The right <span class="highlight">package structure</span> serves everyone better.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Packages Work Better Than Sessions</h2>

    <p>Selling coaching by the session seems straightforward, but it undermines both results and sustainability:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Session-by-Session</th>
                <th>Package-Based</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Client decides each time whether to continue</td>
                <td>Commitment made upfront—client stays through challenges</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inconsistent scheduling disrupts momentum</td>
                <td>Regular cadence builds habits and accountability</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Each session feels like a transaction</td>
                <td>Relationship-based container for transformation</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unpredictable income for coach</td>
                <td>Stable, predictable revenue</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Limited outcomes—clients often quit before results</td>
                <td>Clients stay long enough to achieve meaningful change</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="gradient-box">
        <h4>The Transformation Reality</h4>
        <p>Real health transformation takes time—typically 3-6 months minimum for meaningful, sustainable change. Packages create the container for this transformation. When clients can drop out after one session that felt hard, they never experience the breakthrough that comes from persisting through difficulty.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Designing Effective Coaching Packages</h2>

    <h3>Package Components</h3>

    <div class="light-box-red">
        <h4>Duration</h4>
        <p><strong>3-Month Package:</strong> Good starting point. Allows time for assessment, implementation, and initial results. Popular for focused concerns.</p>
        <p><strong>6-Month Package:</strong> Better for complex cases, multiple issues, or deeper transformation. Allows for complete protocol implementation and adjustment.</p>
        <p><strong>12-Month Package:</strong> For comprehensive transformation or ongoing support. Often priced at a discount. Common for VIP or premium offerings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="light-box-gold">
        <h4>Session Frequency and Length</h4>
        <p><strong>Weekly 60-min:</strong> High-touch, intensive support. Good for complex situations or clients who need more accountability.</p>
        <p><strong>Biweekly 60-min:</strong> Common and effective. Allows time for implementation between sessions.</p>
        <p><strong>Monthly 90-min:</strong> Less intensive, good for maintenance phase or experienced clients.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="light-box-green">
        <h4>Additional Support</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email/message support:</strong> Between-session questions and check-ins</li>
            <li><strong>Resource library:</strong> Handouts, guides, recipes, trackers</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency support:</strong> Brief calls for urgent needs</li>
            <li><strong>Lab review:</strong> If within scope and training</li>
            <li><strong>Meal planning:</strong> If you offer nutrition guidance</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    </div>

    <h2>Pricing Your Services</h2>

    <p>Pricing triggers more anxiety than almost any other business decision. Let's address it head-on.</p>

    <h3>Pricing Approaches</h3>

    <div class="gradient-box">
        <h4>Value-Based Pricing</h4>
        <p>Price based on the value of the transformation, not your time. Ask: What is solving this problem worth to the client?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy and quality of life: Priceless</li>
            <li>Reduced healthcare costs: Thousands per year</li>
            <li>Improved work performance: Career and income impact</li>
            <li>Better relationships: Can't put a price on it</li>
            <li>Prevention of disease: Decades of life quality</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="gold-gradient-box">
        <h4>Sustainability-Based Pricing</h4>
        <p>Calculate what you need to charge to sustain yourself and your practice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Annual income goal:</strong> $X</li>
            <li><strong>Business expenses:</strong> Technology, insurance, continuing education, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Working weeks/year:</strong> Account for vacation, sick time</li>
            <li><strong>Client capacity:</strong> How many clients can you effectively serve?</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate:</strong> (Income + Expenses) ÷ (Clients × Year) = Minimum package price</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Market Research</h3>

    <p>Understand the range in your market:</p>

    <div class="objectives-box">
        <h4>Typical Health Coaching Rates (US, 2024)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New coaches:</strong> $100-200/hour equivalent</li>
            <li><strong>Experienced coaches:</strong> $150-300/hour equivalent</li>
            <li><strong>Specialized/established coaches:</strong> $250-500+/hour equivalent</li>
            <li><strong>3-month packages:</strong> $1,000-5,000</li>
            <li><strong>6-month packages:</strong> $2,500-10,000</li>
            <li><strong>Premium/VIP:</strong> $5,000-20,000+</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>Note: Rates vary significantly by niche, location, credentials, and specialization. These are general ranges for context.</em></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Pricing Mindset</h3>

    <div class="light-box-red">
        <h4>Your Price Reflects Your Value, Not Your Worth</h4>
        <p>You're not selling your hours—you're selling transformation. A client isn't buying 60 minutes of your time; they're buying the ability to have energy, clarity, and health. Price the transformation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="light-box-gold">
        <h4>Underpricing Harms Everyone</h4>
        <p>When you underprice, you can't sustain your practice, you attract less committed clients, and you devalue the entire coaching profession. Sustainable pricing serves everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="light-box-green">
        <h4>Investment Creates Commitment</h4>
        <p>Clients who invest meaningfully show up, do the work, and get results. Free or cheap coaching often produces free or cheap results. The investment is part of the transformation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Presenting Your Pricing</h2>

    <p>How you present pricing matters as much as the number itself:</p>

    <div class="gradient-box">
        <h4>Pricing Presentation Best Practices</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead with transformation:</strong> Describe what they'll achieve before mentioning price</li>
            <li><strong>Anchor to value:</strong> "For the price of a daily coffee, you get your health back"</li>
            <li><strong>State price confidently:</strong> No apologizing, minimizing, or over-explaining</li>

    <h3>Handling Price Objections</h3>

    <div class="objectives-box">
        <h4>"I can't afford it."</h4>
        <p><strong>Explore:</strong> "I understand investment is a consideration. Can you share more about what's holding you back?" Often there are other factors. If truly financial, discuss payment plans or whether the timing is right. Never discount—it devalues your work and attracts the wrong clients.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="objectives-box">
        <h4 style="color: #B8860B;">"I need to think about it."</h4>
        <p><strong>Explore:</strong> "Of course—this is a significant decision. What specifically would you like to think through? Sometimes talking it out helps." Often they have an unstated concern you can address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="objectives-box">
        <h4 style="color: #28a745;">"It costs more than I expected."</h4>
        <p><strong>Explore:</strong> "What were you expecting?" This opens conversation about what they're comparing to, what value they see, and whether you've communicated the transformation effectively.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h4>💡 Tip: Payment Plans ≠ Discounts</h4>
        <p>Offer the same total price with payment options—don't discount for payment plans. If you offer a pay-in-full discount (typically 5-10%), the payment plan price is your actual price, and pay-in-full is the discounted option.</p>
