## ✅ FIRST WAVE — Seed 12-15 Initially

---

### 1. The Big Picture Question (Short)
**"I'm trying to understand the bigger picture. What does the path usually look like from the Mini Diploma onward?"**

---

### 2. The Turning Point (Medium)
**"At what point do you stop feeling like you're 'just learning' and start feeling like this could actually become something real? I need to know there's a light at the end of the tunnel."**

---

### 3. The Specialization Story (Long)
**"I'm really struggling with the specialization question and could use some perspective. I feel drawn to gut health because of my own IBS journey, but I'm also fascinated by hormones since perimenopause hit me like a truck last year. And then there's the mental health connection which honestly might be the most important piece of all. How did you choose? Did you feel like you were 'giving up' the other areas? Or do things naturally start to focus as you learn more?"**

---

### 4. The Practitioner Status Clarity (Short)
**"When people say 'Practitioner Status,' what does that actually mean day to day?"**

---

### 5. The Real Life Balance (Medium)
**"How are people actually balancing this with full-time work, kids, and real life? I want to be realistic before I start. I've got two teenagers, a full-time nursing job, and a husband who travels. Give it to me straight."**

---

### 6. The Hindsight Wisdom (Short)
**"Looking back, is there anything you wish you *didn't* stress so much about in the beginning?"**

---

### 7. The Pace Question (Short)
**"Is it better to move quickly while motivation is high, or take it slow and steady? I tend to burn out when I go too fast."**

---

### 8. The Progress Check Story (Long)
**"I'm about 6 weeks in and honestly having a hard time knowing if I'm 'on track.' Some days I feel like I'm absorbing so much, other days I feel like I've forgotten everything from the week before. What does progress usually look like in the first few months? I'm trying SO HARD not to compare myself to others but it's difficult. Did anyone else feel a bit lost at first before things started clicking?"**

---

### 9. The Opportunity Question (Medium)
**"Once you finish the core pathway, what options actually open up? I'm curious about what's possible but don't want to get too far ahead of myself. Is it mostly virtual practice? In-person? Working with practitioners? I want the real picture."**

---

### 10. The Right Path Confirmation (Short)
**"How did you personally know this path was the right one for you? I keep second-guessing myself."**

---

### 11. The Income Reality Check (Medium)
**"I know it varies wildly, but what's a realistic timeline for starting to earn something from this? I'm not trying to replace my corporate income in year one — I just want to know that eventually this could support me. Not looking for promises, just honest perspectives."**

---

### 12. The First Client Story (Long)
**"The first client thing is really scaring me and I need to hear how others handled it. How did you get your FIRST actual client? Like, the very first human being who trusted you enough to work with you? Did you feel terrified? Did you charge them? Did you question everything you'd learned? I keep imagining this moment and freezing up. I need to know it's not as scary as it seems in my head right now."**

---

### 13. The Certification Value (Short)
**"Do clients actually care about certification? Or is it more about your knowledge and how you show up?"**

---

### 14. The Part-Time Possibility Story (Long)
**"Okay, real question from a 43-year-old mom of 3 who works as a pharmacy tech and has exactly zero interest in leaving my stable job with benefits right now: Can this realistically be a side thing for a while? I'm not dreaming of quitting my job — I'm dreaming of having something meaningful that's MINE, maybe seeing 2-3 clients on the side eventually. Is that even realistic or does this kind of work require full-time commitment to be legit? I need to know before I dive in."**

---

### 15. The Niche Question (Medium)
**"How did you figure out your niche? Did it come naturally from your own health journey, or did you have to experiment with different populations? I feel like I could help SO many people but I keep hearing 'you need a niche.' Is that really true?"**

### 16. The Mentor Relationship (Short)
**"What's the mentor support actually like in this program? Is it real interaction or just pre-recorded stuff and emails?"**

---

### 17. The Community Value Story (Long)
**"I'll be honest — I'm not naturally a 'joiner.' Facebook groups, online communities, that stuff usually makes me cringe. I'm more of a do-it-yourself type. But I keep hearing how important this community is for success. Can someone who also isn't a natural 'community person' share their experience? Did you have to force yourself to engage at first? Was it actually worth it? I'm trying to figure out if I need to push myself out of my comfort zone here."**

---

### 18. The Confidence Timeline (Medium)
**"How long did it take before you felt confident actually calling yourself a practitioner? Even just casually to friends? I can't imagine ever introducing myself that way without feeling like a fraud."**

---

### 19. The Building Phase (Short)
**"What are people doing to build their practice while still learning? Or do most wait until after they complete everything?"**

---

### 20. The Long Game (Short)
**"Five years from now, where do you see yourself with this? I'm trying to think long-term."**

---

### 21. The Nurse Transition Story (Long)
**"I'm an RN with 18 years in the hospital system and I'm burned OUT. I got into nursing to help people but I spend 80% of my time on documentation and the other 20% putting band-aids on chronic conditions that nobody seems interested in actually fixing. Functional medicine feels like what I was SUPPOSED to be doing all along. For any nurses who made this transition — how did it go? Did your nursing background help or did you have to 'unlearn' a lot? And most importantly — are you happier now?"**

---

### 22. The Marketing Fear (Medium)
**"This might be a weird question but… how do you market yourself without feeling gross about it? I'm not a salesy person AT ALL. The idea of promoting myself on social media or 'building a brand' makes me want to hide. Is there a way to build a practice without becoming an influencer?"**

---

### 23. The Pricing Question Story (Long)
**"I'm already anxious about pricing even though I haven't even finished the diploma yet. How do you decide what to charge? I have this mental block where I think 'who am I to charge money for this?' but I also know I can't help people for free forever. For those of you actually seeing clients — how did you get past the pricing anxiety? Did you start low and raise prices? Charge what you're worth from day one? I need to hear how real people handled this."**

---

### 24. The Lab Work Question (Short)
**"Can practitioners order labs or do you have to work with doctors for that? I'm confused about the scope."**

---

### 25. The Credibility Concern Story (Long)
**"Here's something I can't stop thinking about. I have a bachelor's degree in English literature from 25 years ago. That's it. No health background, no sciences, nothing. When I look at other practitioners they seem to have all these credentials and letters after their names. Will anyone take me seriously with just this certification? I want to help people but I'm terrified of being seen as 'not qualified.' Did anyone else start from a completely non-health background and build a credible practice? I need some hope here."**

---

### 26. The Insurance Question (Medium)
**"This might be basic but do functional medicine practitioners accept insurance? Or is it all private pay? I'm trying to understand the business model and what clients typically pay out of pocket."**

---

### 27. The Family Practice Story (Long)
**"Okay so my situation might be a little different. I originally started researching functional medicine to help my daughter who has PCOS and my mom who has early-stage autoimmune issues. I've kind of become the 'health researcher' in my family. Now I'm thinking… could I actually turn this into something that helps OTHER families too? Has anyone else started from trying to help their own family and turned it into a wider practice? How did that transition work?"**

---

### 28. The Collaboration Question (Short)
**"Do practitioners usually work solo or do people collaborate with others? I'm naturally more collaborative."**

---

### 29. The Virtual Practice Story (Long)
**"I live in rural Montana and there's basically NO functional medicine practitioners anywhere near me. Which is great because there's clearly a need, but also means I'd have to build something mostly virtual. For those doing virtual practice — how does it work? Do clients feel like they're getting enough support over video calls? Are there limitations I should know about? I keep going back and forth between 'this is perfect for me' and 'maybe this only works in person.'"**

---

### 30. The Scope of Practice (Medium)
**"I keep hearing about 'scope of practice' and honestly it scares me a little. What can practitioners actually do vs. what lines can't be crossed? I don't want to accidentally do something I'm not supposed to."**

---

### 31. The Continuing Education (Short)
**"After you finish, is continuing education required? How do you keep learning and stay current?"**

---

### 32. The Client Retention Story (Long)
**"Something I'm curious about that I haven't seen discussed much: once you have clients, how do you keep them? Is functional medicine a 'one and done' thing where you fix their problem and they move on? Or do people stay with you long-term? I'm trying to understand what a sustainable practice looks like — not just getting clients but actually keeping a practice going year after year."**

---

### 33. The Imposter Syndrome Timeline (Medium)
**"Real talk — does the imposter syndrome ever fully go away? Or is it something you just learn to manage? I already feel it and I haven't even started. Hoping someone further along can give me some perspective."**

---

### 34. The Men in Practice (Short)
**"I notice most people here seem to be women. Are there many men doing this? Would that be weird or is it just less common?"**

---

### 35. The Corporate Wellness Story (Long)
**"I've been in corporate HR for 15 years and I keep seeing how terrible our 'wellness programs' are — like, pizza parties and a gym discount don't fix burnout and chronic disease. I'm wondering if there's a way to bring functional medicine concepts into corporate settings eventually. Has anyone thought about or done corporate wellness consulting? I feel like there's a huge gap between what companies offer and what employees actually need for their health."**

---

### 36. The International Question (Medium)
**"I'm based in Germany and wondering if anyone else is practicing internationally? Are there limitations I should know about? Or does the certification still hold value outside the US?"**

---

### 37. The Age and Clients Story (Long)
**"This might sound strange but I'm 54 and wondering if my age is actually an ADVANTAGE for certain clients. I feel like women my age might connect better with someone who's been through menopause, raised kids, dealt with real life. As opposed to a 28-year-old who looks great but hasn't lived through the same challenges. Is anyone else using their 'been there, done that' life experience as a selling point? Or am I overthinking this?"**

---

### 38. The Technology Barrier (Short)
**"Is the technology side of running a practice complicated? I'm not super tech savvy and worried about the logistics."**

---

### 39. The Exit Strategy (Medium)
**"This is maybe premature but I'm curious — can you eventually sell a functional medicine practice? Or is it too dependent on the individual practitioner? I'm thinking way ahead but wondering about the long-term business potential."**

---

### 40. The Passion vs Burnout Story (Long)
**"I want to share something I've been thinking about. Part of why I'm drawn to this is because I'm passionate about health — but I'm also a little worried that turning my passion into a job might kill the passion? Has anyone experienced this? Is there a way to do this work without burning out the same way I burned out in my corporate job? I want to help people and feel fulfilled, not create another source of stress."**

---

### 41. The Regret Question (Short)
**"For those who've been at this for a year or more: any regrets? Anything you'd do differently if you could start over?"**
