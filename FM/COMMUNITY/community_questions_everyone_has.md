## ✅ FIRST WAVE — Seed 8-10 Initially

---

### 1. The Confidence Question (Short)
**"This might sound silly… but do you have to feel confident *before* enrolling? Or does that come later?"**

---

### 2. The No-Background Story (Long)
**"Okay so here's my situation. I'm 46, I've worked in HR for almost two decades, and I have ZERO medical background. Like, none. The closest I got was reading health blogs and helping my mom navigate her diabetes diagnosis a few years ago. I feel so drawn to this work but every time I look at the program I think 'who am I to do this?' Is that normal? Did anyone else start from square one like this or am I kidding myself?"**

---

### 3. The Readiness Worry (Medium)
**"How did you personally know you were 'ready' to work with real people? I keep imagining someone asking me a question I can't answer and me just freezing. That fear is real for me right now."**

---

### 4. The Emotional Rollercoaster (Short)
**"Some days I'm really excited about this… and other days I feel completely overwhelmed. Is that normal or should I be worried?"**

---

### 5. The Mom Guilt Story (Long)
**"I'm a mom of 3 (ages 8, 12, and 15) and I work part-time at a dental office. My husband is supportive but honestly I feel guilty even thinking about spending $997 on myself. Like, that's money that could go toward the kids' activities or into savings. But I also know I've put myself last for 15 years and I'm exhausted by it. I need something that's MINE. Did anyone else struggle with this? How did you get past the guilt of investing in yourself?"**

---

### 6. The Mistake Fear (Short)
**"What if I enroll and still feel unsure for a while? I don't want to feel like I made a mistake."**

---

### 7. The Busy Life Reality (Medium)
**"Can you actually do this at a slower pace and still succeed? I work full-time, have two kids in sports, and my husband travels for work. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have maybe 4-5 hours a week MAX. Is that enough or am I setting myself up to fail?"**

---

### 8. The Age Doubt (Short)
**"Did anyone else feel like they might be 'too old' to start something new at 47? I hate even asking that."**

---

### 9. The Health Journey Story (Long)
**"I'll be honest about why I'm here. Three years ago I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and my conventional doctor basically said 'here's your meds, see you in 6 months.' I started researching on my own and eventually found a functional medicine practitioner who changed my life. Like, completely. I lost 30 lbs, my brain fog cleared, I got my energy back. Now I can't stop thinking about doing this for other women who feel as lost as I did. But can I actually turn this into a real thing? Or is it just a nice idea that won't go anywhere?"**

---

### 10. The Waiting Loop (Medium)
**"I keep telling myself to 'wait a little longer' before committing… first it was 'wait until after the holidays,' then 'wait until spring,' now it's 'wait until things settle down at work.' But things never settle down. How did YOU finally decide to just go for it?"**

---

## 🔄 SECOND WAVE — Drip 1-2 Per Week

---

### 11. The Specialization Confusion (Short)
**"Is it okay to start without knowing exactly which specialization you want? I feel interested in *everything* and that's honestly confusing me."**

---

### 12. The Surprise Factor (Short)
**"What surprised you the most once you actually started the pathway? Good or bad, I want the real answer."**

---

### 13. The Divorce Restart Story (Long)
**"I'm going to be real because I need to hear from people who get it. I'm 52, recently divorced after 24 years, kids are in college, and for the first time in my life I'm asking 'what do I actually want?' I've been a teacher my whole career and I'm burned out. Like, completely. This functional medicine thing keeps calling to me but starting something brand new at this stage of life is terrifying. Anyone else in a similar 'starting over' situation? Did you feel crazy at first?"**

---

### 14. The Imposter Syndrome (Medium)
**"Does anyone else feel like maybe they don't have what it takes? Like, I look at some of the practitioners out there and they seem so polished and knowledgeable. I can't imagine ever being that confident. Please tell me this gets better."**

---

### 15. The Family Support Concern (Short)
**"My family doesn't really get why I want to do this. Did anyone else start without full support from people around them?"**

---

### 16. The Online Learning History (Medium)
**"I've tried online courses before — bought at least 5 or 6 over the years — and never finished a single one. They all seemed great at first and then I lost momentum. What makes this different? And please be honest, not salesy."**

---

### 17. The Career Change Fear Story (Long)
**"I've been in corporate marketing for 22 years. TWENTY-TWO. I'm tired, I feel meaningless, and honestly I dread Sunday nights because of Monday. About a year ago my sister got sick and I fell down this rabbit hole of functional medicine research trying to help her. It opened my eyes to so much. Now I can't stop thinking about switching paths entirely but the idea of leaving a stable 6-figure job for something completely unknown is terrifying. Has anyone else made a dramatic pivot like this? How did you handle the fear?"**

---

### 18. The Time Question (Short)
**"Realistically, how many hours per week should I expect to put in? I need real numbers, not marketing talk."**

---

### 19. The Self-Doubt Loop (Medium)
**"Every time I'm about to commit, this voice in my head says 'who do you think you are?' It's the same voice that's kept me stuck in a job I hate for years. How do you push past that? Because logic isn't working for me."**

---

### 20. The Perfectionism Trap (Short)
**"I tend to overthink everything and need things to be 'just right' before I move forward. Is this pathway okay for someone like me?"**

---

### 21. The Alone Feeling Story (Long)
**"Does anyone else feel a bit alone in this decision? My friends all have 'normal' careers — accountant, teacher, real estate agent. When I try to explain why I'm interested in functional medicine they look at me like I've joined a cult lol. My husband supports me but doesn't really understand the pull. I just want to know there are other women out there who feel this calling even when nobody around them gets it. Am I crazy?"**

---

### 22. The Starting Over at 50 (Medium)
**"At 51, I sometimes feel like I'm 'starting over' while everyone else my age is settled. My kids are grown, I'm still figuring out who I am without them needing me constantly. Is it as scary as it seems or does it get easier once you start?"**

---

### 23. The Investment Anxiety Story (Long)
**"$997 is not nothing for me. I'm not going to pretend it is. We're comfortable but not wealthy, and every dollar I spend on myself feels like it needs to be justified. My husband said 'if this is what you want, do it' but I can tell he's skeptical. I need to know this is worth it — not just for me emotionally but actually WORTH IT in terms of what I'll learn and where it can lead. Can someone who was also nervous about the money share their experience? Did you feel it was worth it in the end?"**

---

### 24. The Health Coach Comparison (Short)
**"What's the difference between this and just becoming a health coach? I keep seeing both terms and I'm confused about the path."**

---

### 25. The Credential Worry (Medium)
**"I don't have any letters after my name — no RN, no MS, nothing. Will that hold me back? Or do people actually respect this certification when you finish?"**

---

### 26. The Overwhelm Story (Long)
**"Can I just be honest about where I'm at? I've been researching functional medicine programs for probably 8 months now. I've downloaded at least 10 freebies, watched webinars, compared programs, made pro/con lists… and I'm MORE confused than when I started. Part of me thinks I'm using 'research' as an excuse to not actually commit. But another part of me is genuinely scared to make the wrong choice. Anyone else been stuck in analysis paralysis like this? How did you finally pick?"**

---

### 27. The Trust Question (Short)
**"How do I know this program is legit and not just another online course that promises everything and delivers nothing? Genuine question."**
