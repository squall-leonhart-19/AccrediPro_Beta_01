            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The four phases are: Connection (5-10 min to build rapport), Story (15-20 min letting client tell their story), Targeted Questions (20-30 min filling in gaps), and Summary/Next Steps (10-15 min reviewing and planning)."

                "Use 3 supplements at a time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limit initial changes to 3 main interventions. Humans can manage 3 new things; 10 creates overwhelm and non-compliance. Start with highest-impact changes, establish those habits, then add more."

            "options": [
                "To make excuses for treatment failure",
                "To prevent panic and dropout when die-off and adjustment reactions occur",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Preparing clients for initial worsening prevents panic and dropout. Die-off, dietary adjustment, and detoxification shifts are common in weeks 1-2. If clients expect this, they continue rather than abandoning treatment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The teach-back method asks clients to explain back what you told them in their own words. This confirms understanding and reveals communication gaps. If they struggle, it indicates need for clearer explanation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-compliance usually reflects barriers, not laziness: too many changes at once, not understanding why recommendations matter, practical barriers (cost, time), or emotional resistance. Ask 'What's getting in the way?'"

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gut healing typically takes 3-6 months. Weeks 1-4 are adjustment, weeks 4-8 show initial improvement, months 2-4 bring deeper healing, and months 4-6+ achieve full restoration and maintenance transition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients tend to forget how bad things were and 'move the goalposts.' Anchoring to baseline helps them see progress: 'You went from 8/10 to 5/10 bloating.' Without this, clients may feel unimproved even when significantly better."
