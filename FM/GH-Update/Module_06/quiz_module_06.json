            "question": "What does 'bidirectional' mean in the context of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": [
                "The brain only affects the gut",
                "The gut only affects the brain",
                "Communication goes both ways—the brain affects gut function AND the gut affects brain function",
                "Neither affects the other"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bidirectional means communication goes both ways. The brain affects gut function (stress impairs digestion), AND the gut affects brain function (microbiome influences mood, 90% of serotonin is made in the gut). 80% of vagus nerve fibers are afferent (gut to brain), emphasizing how much the gut 'talks' to the brain."

            "question": "Why is the extended exhale particularly important in diaphragmatic breathing?",
            "options": [
                "It builds lung capacity",
                "It specifically activates the vagus nerve and triggers the parasympathetic relaxation response",
                "It burns more calories",
                "It's not important; the inhale matters more"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The extended exhale specifically activates the vagus nerve and shifts the body toward parasympathetic state. While inhaling activates some sympathetic activity, the long exhale (6-8 counts) signals safety to the nervous system and triggers the relaxation response."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "What is the single most important sleep intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Taking melatonin supplements",
                "Blocking all blue light",
                "Consistent sleep and wake times—including weekends",
                "Sleeping more than 10 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent sleep timing is the most important intervention. The body's circadian rhythm needs consistency to function properly—going to bed and waking at the same time (including weekends) allows optimal hormone cycling, digestion timing, and microbiome rhythms."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Why can intense exercise worsen gut symptoms in clients with active gut issues?",
            "options": [
                "Exercise is always bad for the gut",
                "Intense exercise diverts blood from the gut to muscles, temporarily increasing permeability",
                "Exercise causes permanent gut damage",
                "This only happens with running"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intense exercise diverts blood from the gut to muscles, reducing intestinal blood flow by up to 80%. This can temporarily increase intestinal permeability, cause cramping, nausea, and diarrhea. For clients with active gut issues, this additional stress can worsen symptoms. Gentle to moderate exercise is preferred during healing."

            "question": "Why is glyphosate particularly harmful to gut health?",
            "options": [
                "It only affects plants",
                "It was patented as an antibiotic—it kills beneficial gut bacteria and damages tight junctions",
                "It has no effect on humans",
                "It only affects the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glyphosate (Roundup) was patented as an antibiotic—it kills beneficial bacteria in the gut just as it kills weeds. It damages the microbiome, disrupts tight junctions (increasing permeability), and has been linked to leaky gut. It's the most widely used herbicide and found on most conventional produce."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "How long can the effects of a single antibiotic course persist on the microbiome?",
            "options": [
                "A few days",
                "About 2 weeks",
                "6-12 months or even longer for some species",
                "Effects are immediate and then gone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A single antibiotic course reduces microbiome diversity by 25-30%, and some species may not recover for 6-12 months or even longer. This is why antibiotic history is so important—gut issues often trace back to antibiotics years earlier. Broad-spectrum antibiotics cause more lasting damage than targeted options."

            "question": "Why do PPIs increase SIBO risk?",
            "options": [
                "They cause constipation",
                "They reduce stomach acid by 90%+, allowing more bacteria to survive and colonize the small intestine",
                "They speed up motility too much",
                "They kill beneficial bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PPIs reduce stomach acid by 90%+. Normally, stomach acid kills most bacteria that enter with food. When acid is suppressed, more bacteria survive and can colonize the small intestine. SIBO risk increases 2-3x with PPI use."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "What is 'habit stacking'?",
            "options": [
                "Doing many habits at once",
                "Linking a new behavior to an existing habit: 'After I [current habit], I will [new habit]'",
                "Stacking supplements together",
                "Doing habits in any random order"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking links a new behavior to an existing habit: 'After I [current habit], I will [new habit].' It's effective because the existing habit serves as an automatic trigger—you don't have to remember or use willpower. The behavior becomes part of an established routine."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "What is the 'minimum effective dose' approach to lifestyle change?",
            "options": [
                "Taking the maximum amount of supplements",
                "Starting with the smallest intervention that produces results to avoid overwhelm",
                "Doing as much as possible immediately",
                "Only making changes when forced"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Start with the smallest intervention that produces results—avoiding overwhelm. For example, 3 deep breaths before meals instead of 30 minutes meditation. Once this small habit is established, it naturally grows. This builds success and confidence rather than creating failure from unsustainable goals."

            "options": [
                "Intense exercise daily, supplements, and fasting",
                "3 deep breaths before meals, consistent sleep times, post-meal walk, no screens during meals, 4-5 hours between meals",
                "Only medication management",
                "These recommendations vary too much to generalize"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Foundation Level lifestyle recommendations for everyone include: 3 deep breaths before meals, consistent sleep/wake times, 10-minute post-meal walk, no screens during meals, and 4-5 hours between meals (no snacking). These are minimum effective dose interventions that support gut health universally."
