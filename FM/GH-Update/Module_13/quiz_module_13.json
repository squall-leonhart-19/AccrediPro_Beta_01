            "question": "What is the difference between conventional and functional lab ranges?",
            "options": [
                "They are the same thing",
                "Conventional is based on sick population; functional is based on optimal health",
                "Functional ranges are wider than conventional",
                "Conventional ranges are stricter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conventional ranges are based on 95% of the tested population (often unhealthy). Functional ranges are tighter and based on optimal health, catching dysfunction before disease develops."

            "question": "What does low pancreatic elastase on a stool test indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Bacterial overgrowth",
                "Pancreatic insufficiency - enzymes needed",
                "Parasitic infection",
                "Low stomach acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low pancreatic elastase indicates pancreatic insufficiency—the pancreas isn't producing enough digestive enzymes. This leads to malabsorption and requires digestive enzyme supplementation."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "What is the positive criterion for hydrogen SIBO on a breath test?",
            "options": [
                "Any hydrogen detected",
                "≥10 ppm at any time",
                "≥20 ppm rise from baseline within 90 minutes",
                "≥50 ppm rise at 3 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A rise of ≥20 ppm hydrogen from baseline within 90 minutes of ingesting the substrate is positive for hydrogen SIBO. The early timing indicates fermentation in the small intestine."

            "question": "What does elevated arabinose on an organic acids test indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Bacterial overgrowth",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated arabinose (arabinitol) is the #1 marker for Candida/yeast overgrowth. It's a byproduct of yeast metabolism and indicates need for antifungal treatment."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "What does elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Folate deficiency",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated MMA is a functional marker for B12 insufficiency—even when serum B12 looks normal. B12 is needed to convert MMA; when low, it accumulates."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "What blood chemistry pattern suggests poor protein digestion?",
            "options": [
                "High total protein + high BUN",
                "Low total protein + low BUN",

                "High alkaline phosphatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low total protein + low BUN suggests poor protein digestion. This pattern often indicates low stomach acid (HCl) and/or inadequate digestive enzymes."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "What does low alkaline phosphatase on blood chemistry suggest?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low alkaline phosphatase is a functional marker for zinc deficiency. ALP is a zinc-dependent enzyme. When zinc is low, ALP activity decreases."

            "question": "Why might someone have multiple high IgG results on food sensitivity testing?",
            "options": [
                "They have allergies to all those foods",
                "It often indicates leaky gut, not true sensitivities",
                "They eat too much variety",
                "The test is always inaccurate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple high IgG results often indicate leaky gut rather than true sensitivities. When the gut is permeable, more food proteins cross into the bloodstream, triggering antibody production."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "When should you retest SIBO breath test after treatment?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately after treatment",
                "2-4 weeks after completing antimicrobial phase",
                "6 months after treatment",
                "Only if symptoms return"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Retest SIBO breath test 2-4 weeks after completing the antimicrobial phase. This allows time for gases to normalize but catches remaining overgrowth before regrowth."

                "IgE skin prick test",
                "Elimination diet with systematic reintroduction",
                "MRT testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The elimination diet with systematic reintroduction remains the gold standard. Tests can guide which foods to prioritize eliminating, but confirmation requires removing the food and reintroducing to observe reaction."
