            "question": "What is the key difference between functional and pathological lab ranges?",
            "options": [
                "Functional ranges are always wider than pathological ranges",
                "Pathological ranges detect disease; functional ranges are narrower and identify subclinical dysfunction",
                "They are identical but named differently",
                "Functional ranges are only used in Europe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pathological ranges are designed to identify disease states and are based on population averages (often including people with subclinical issues). Functional ranges are narrower and based on optimal function, helping identify dysfunction before it becomes pathology."

                "SIBO and Candida",
                "Food allergies and sensitivities",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a marker of intestinal inflammation. Elevated calprotectin (>50-200 µg/g) suggests IBD or infection with actual tissue inflammation. Normal calprotectin in a symptomatic patient suggests functional disorder like IBS, which is appropriate for practitioner support."

            "options": [
                "Hydrogen ≥10 ppm; Methane ≥20 ppm",
                "Hydrogen ≥20 ppm rise by 90 min; Methane ≥10 ppm at any point",
                "Any detectable hydrogen or methane",
                "Hydrogen ≥50 ppm; Methane ≥25 ppm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Positive hydrogen SIBO requires a rise of ≥20 ppm above baseline within 90 minutes. Positive methane (IMO) requires ≥10 ppm at any point during the test. These thresholds are based on North American Consensus guidelines."

                "Bacterial overgrowth",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Arabinose is a metabolite specifically produced by yeast. Elevated levels indicate active Candida/fungal overgrowth with metabolic activity—not just colonization. This is valuable because stool tests might miss yeast or not indicate activity level."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Why is IgG food sensitivity testing controversial?",
            "options": [
                "It's too expensive",
                "It requires a blood draw",
                "IgG antibodies may indicate normal exposure/tolerance rather than pathological reactivity",
                "It only tests for 10 foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IgG antibodies to foods are found in healthy individuals and may simply indicate normal exposure and immune tolerance—not necessarily a problem. Major allergy organizations caution against using IgG tests for diagnosis. Elimination diet remains the gold standard."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client has low ferritin, low B12, and elevated MCV. What pattern does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "High stomach acid",
                "Parasitic infection",
                "Low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria)",
                "Gallbladder dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is the classic low stomach acid pattern. Both iron and B12 require adequate acid for absorption, and elevated MCV indicates macrocytic anemia from B12/folate deficiency. Investigate H. pylori, PPI use, and consider acid support."

                "A yeast metabolite indicating Candida",
                "A marker of pathogenic Clostridia bacteria with potential neurotoxic effects",

                "An inflammation marker"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HPHPA is a metabolite produced by pathogenic Clostridia bacteria. Elevated levels indicate Clostridia overgrowth and are associated with neurotoxicity—HPHPA can affect neurotransmitter function, potentially contributing to mood and cognitive issues."

            "question": "What is the advantage of lactulose over glucose as a SIBO breath test substrate?",
            "options": [
                "Higher specificity",
                "Can detect distal (far end) SIBO because lactulose travels the entire small intestine",
                "Lower cost",
                "No preparation required"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lactulose is non-absorbed and travels the entire small intestine, allowing detection of distal SIBO. Glucose is absorbed in the proximal small intestine and may miss distal overgrowth. The trade-off is lactulose has lower specificity."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "How does OAT complement stool testing?",
            "options": [
                "They test for the same things",
                "Stool shows organism presence; OAT shows metabolic activity",
                "OAT is more expensive so it's more accurate",
                "OAT replaces the need for stool testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stool testing identifies WHAT organisms are present. OAT shows metabolic ACTIVITY—what those organisms are actually doing. Together they provide a complete picture: is Candida just colonizing or actively producing problematic metabolites?"

            "question": "Why are scoring systems valuable in assessment questionnaires?",
            "options": [
                "They make forms look more professional",
                "They provide objective tracking—a score dropping from 45 to 28 demonstrates improvement even if the client thinks they feel 'about the same'",
                "Insurance companies require them",
                "They are required by law"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scoring provides objective tracking of progress. Numbers reveal gradual improvement that's easily missed subjectively. This validates your work, motivates clients, helps with retention, and provides documentation for outcomes."
