            "question": "Why should dietary and lifestyle foundations be addressed before intensive supplementation?",
            "options": [
                "Supplements are too expensive to use first",
                "Supplements work best as accelerators when fundamentals are in place—they don't replace diet and lifestyle",
                "There's no particular order that matters",
                "Foundations should come after supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supplements accelerate healing but don't replace diet, sleep, and stress management. No supplement overcomes poor fundamentals. Think of supplements as accelerators that work best when the vehicle (diet, lifestyle) is already heading in the right direction."

            "question": "What is the purpose of the HCl challenge protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To test for H. pylori infection",
                "To determine the individual dose of Betaine HCl needed by finding the point where slight warmth is felt",
                "To diagnose GERD",
                "To measure stomach pH directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HCl challenge determines individual dosing needs. Start with 1 capsule per protein-containing meal, increase by 1 each meal until slight warmth is felt in the upper abdomen, then reduce by 1 capsule—this is the optimal dose. Most people need 1-5 capsules per meal."

            "options": [
                "It's the cheapest option",
                "It's the primary fuel for enterocytes (intestinal cells) and supports tight junction integrity",
                "It tastes better than other supplements",
                "It's only needed in small doses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enterocytes preferentially use L-glutamine (not glucose) for energy. Glutamine supports tight junction proteins that maintain intestinal barrier integrity, and also supports mucus production and gut immune function. Therapeutic doses are 5-10g daily."

            "question": "Why should biofilm disruptors be used before antimicrobials?",
            "options": [
                "They're cheaper to use first",
                "Biofilms are protective matrices pathogens create; disrupting them allows antimicrobials to penetrate and reach organisms",
                "They taste better when taken first",
                "There's no benefit to the order"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pathogens create protective biofilm matrices that shield them from antimicrobials. Biofilm disruptors (NAC, enzymes, EDTA) break down these structures, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate and reach the organisms. Starting disruptors 1-2 weeks before antimicrobials improves treatment effectiveness."

            "options": [
                "They're not real probiotics",
                "They add more bacteria to an already overgrown small intestine",
                "They're too expensive",
                "They only work in the large intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard probiotics add more bacteria to a small intestine that's already overgrown—adding fuel to the fire. Better options during active SIBO: spore-based probiotics (don't colonize small intestine), S. boulardii (yeast, not bacteria), or waiting until after antimicrobial treatment."

            "options": [
                "It's the cheapest option",
                "It's a therapeutic yeast (not bacteria), so it won't worsen SIBO and can be used during antibiotic courses",
                "It only works for children",
                "It requires refrigeration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "S. boulardii is a therapeutic yeast, not bacteria. This means it won't worsen SIBO, can be taken during antibiotic courses (antibiotics don't kill yeast), is excellent for C. diff prevention/treatment, prevents traveler's diarrhea, and doesn't require refrigeration."

            "options": [
                "A type of probiotic strain",
                "A cyclical cleansing wave that sweeps bacteria from the small intestine during fasting—impaired MMC causes SIBO",
                "A digestive enzyme",
                "A type of dietary fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC is a cyclical cleansing wave that sweeps bacteria, debris, and undigested food from the small intestine into the colon every 90-120 minutes during fasting. It's the gut's natural protection against bacterial overgrowth. Impaired MMC is the primary cause of SIBO development and recurrence."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Why is meal spacing (4-5 hours between meals) critical for SIBO prevention?",
            "options": [
                "It helps with weight loss",
                "The MMC only fires during fasting—constant eating prevents the cleansing waves from occurring",
                "It reduces supplement costs",
                "It's not actually important"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC only activates during fasting—eating stops it. Constant snacking prevents cleansing waves from occurring. Allowing 4-5 hours between meals enables 2-3 MMC cycles. This is possibly the most important long-term SIBO prevention strategy."

            "question": "What is the correct order of the 5R Framework?",

                "Repair, Remove, Reinoculate, Replace, Rebalance",
                "Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, Repair, Rebalance",
                "Rebalance, Reinoculate, Remove, Replace, Repair",
                "Replace, Repair, Remove, Reinoculate, Rebalance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5R Framework: Remove (inflammatory foods, pathogens) → Replace (digestive factors) → Reinoculate (probiotics after antimicrobials) → Repair (gut lining healing) → Rebalance (ongoing lifestyle). You can't repair a gut that's still under attack—Remove comes first."

            "question": "What is 'protocol stacking' and why should it be avoided?",
            "options": [
                "A beneficial way to speed up treatment",
                "Starting too many supplements simultaneously, making it impossible to identify what's helping or causing reactions",
                "Taking supplements with food",
                "Following proper sequencing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protocol stacking means starting too many supplements at once. It's problematic because you can't identify what's helping or causing reactions, it's overwhelming for clients, and expensive. Better: introduce 1-2 new elements per week maximum so you can track response."
