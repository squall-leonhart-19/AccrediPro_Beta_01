            "question": "According to Rome IV criteria, what is required for an IBS diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "A positive breath test for SIBO",
                "Recurrent abdominal pain at least 1 day/week for 3 months, associated with defecation and/or change in stool frequency/form",
                "Elevated inflammatory markers on blood work",
                "Visible inflammation on colonoscopy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rome IV requires recurrent abdominal pain averaging at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with 2 or more of: relation to defecation, change in stool frequency, or change in stool form. It's a diagnosis of inclusion based on symptom patterns."

            "question": "What distinguishes methane SIBO (IMO) from hydrogen SIBO in terms of symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Methane causes diarrhea; hydrogen causes constipation",
                "Methane causes constipation; hydrogen causes diarrhea",
                "Both cause identical symptoms",
                "Methane causes reflux; hydrogen causes bloating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methane-producing organisms slow intestinal transit, causing constipation (IBS-C pattern), while hydrogen-producing bacteria cause diarrhea and urgency (IBS-D pattern). This distinction is important for treatment selection."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)?",
            "options": [
                "Producing stomach acid",
                "Sweeping bacteria and debris from the small intestine during fasting",
                "Absorbing nutrients from food",
                "Producing digestive enzymes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC is the 'housekeeper wave' that sweeps the small intestine during fasting periods, clearing bacteria and debris toward the colon. When damaged, bacteria accumulate, leading to SIBO."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "How does Crohn's disease differ from ulcerative colitis?",
            "options": [
                "Crohn's affects only the colon; UC can affect any part of the GI tract",
                "Crohn's can affect any part of the GI tract with transmural inflammation; UC is limited to colon/rectum with mucosal inflammation",
                "Both conditions are identical in presentation",
                "Crohn's never causes diarrhea; UC always causes constipation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crohn's can affect anywhere from mouth to anus with transmural (full-thickness) inflammation and skip lesions. UC is limited to colon and rectum with continuous mucosal inflammation starting from the rectum."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Why might LOW stomach acid cause reflux symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Low acid causes food to digest too quickly",
                "Low acid leads to delayed gastric emptying, fermentation, and poor LES signaling",
                "Low acid directly damages the esophagus",
                "Low acid is not related to reflux symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low acid causes delayed gastric emptying (food sits longer), bacterial fermentation (producing gas), and poor LES closure signaling. This creates upward pressure, pushing stomach contents into the esophagus—acid in the wrong place, not too much acid."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What is the gold standard for identifying food sensitivities?",
            "options": [
                "IgG blood testing",
                "IgE skin prick testing",
                "Elimination diet with systematic reintroduction",
                "Muscle testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The elimination diet remains the gold standard because it directly demonstrates cause and effect: remove the food, symptoms improve; reintroduce, symptoms return. IgG testing has significant limitations and may only indicate exposure, not true reactivity."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What conditions allow normally commensal Candida to become problematic?",
            "options": [
                "Eating too much protein",
                "Excessive exercise",
                "Antibiotic use, high sugar diet, immunosuppression, PPI use",
                "Drinking too much water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Candida overgrow when competing bacteria are killed (antibiotics), fuel is abundant (high sugar), immune control is reduced (steroids, immunosuppression), or the gut environment changes (PPIs, birth control)."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Why is PCR-based stool testing preferred over standard O&P for parasites?",
            "options": [
                "It's less expensive",
                "It uses DNA detection which is more sensitive than microscopy",
                "It doesn't require a stool sample",
                "It only takes one minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCR testing uses DNA detection, which is significantly more sensitive than traditional microscopy (O&P). Standard O&P has a high false-negative rate because parasites shed intermittently and may be missed on single samples."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "What is a die-off (Herxheimer) reaction?",
            "options": [
                "An allergic response to supplements",
                "Temporary symptom worsening when pathogens are killed rapidly, releasing toxins",
                "A sign that treatment isn't working",
                "A permanent side effect of antifungals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Die-off occurs when Candida, bacteria, or other organisms are killed rapidly, releasing toxins that temporarily worsen symptoms. It's managed by starting slowly and supporting detoxification pathways."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What percentage of IBS patients may have underlying SIBO?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "20-30%",
                "60-80%",
                "Less than 1%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests 60-80% of IBS patients may have underlying SIBO. SIBO is often the mechanistic explanation for IBS symptoms, which is why SIBO should always be considered when working with IBS clients."
