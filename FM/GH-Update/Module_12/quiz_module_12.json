            "question": "What is the correct order of the 5R Framework?",
            "options": [
                "Repair, Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, Rebalance",
                "Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, Repair, Rebalance",
                "Rebalance, Repair, Reinoculate, Replace, Remove",
                "Replace, Remove, Repair, Reinoculate, Rebalance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5R Framework follows: Remove (pathogens, stressors) → Replace (digestive factors) → Reinoculate (probiotics) → Repair (mucosal lining) → Rebalance (lifestyle). Order matters for optimal results."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Why is prokinetic therapy essential after SIBO treatment?",
            "options": [
                "To replace digestive enzymes",
                "To restore the MMC (migrating motor complex) and prevent recurrence",
                "To feed beneficial bacteria",
                "To increase stomach acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC is the 'cleaning wave' that sweeps bacteria from the small intestine. SIBO often results from impaired MMC. Without prokinetics to restore motility, SIBO recurrence rates are 45% or higher."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "How long should prokinetic therapy continue after SIBO treatment?",
            "options": [
                "1 week",
                "2 weeks",
                "3+ months minimum",
                "Until symptoms return"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prokinetic therapy should continue for 3+ months minimum after SIBO treatment. Some clients need indefinite prokinetic support to maintain healthy motility and prevent recurrence."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Why should antifungals be rotated during Candida treatment?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce costs",
                "To prevent Candida from developing resistance",
                "To improve absorption",
                "To reduce side effects"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Candida can develop resistance to antifungals quickly. Rotating every 2-4 weeks prevents adaptation. Example: oregano oil for 2 weeks, then caprylic acid for 2 weeks, then berberine."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Why does parasite treatment typically need 60-90 days?",
            "options": [
                "Parasites take that long to die",
                "To cover multiple life cycle stages (eggs, larvae, adults)",
                "Medications need to build up",
                "Insurance requirements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parasites have life cycles with eggs, larvae, and adults. Treatment may kill adults but egg forms survive. Multiple cycles (60-90 days = 2-3 lunar cycles) are needed to catch all life stages."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "What is L-glutamine's primary role in leaky gut repair?",
            "options": [
                "It kills pathogens",
                "It is the primary fuel for enterocytes (intestinal cells)",
                "It increases stomach acid",
                "It feeds beneficial bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-glutamine is the primary fuel source for enterocytes (intestinal cells). Without adequate glutamine, these cells can't function or repair properly. Therapeutic doses are 5-30g daily."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "What condition should always be checked in constipation cases?",
            "options": [
                "Kidney function",
                "Hypothyroidism",
                "Blood pressure",
                "Blood sugar"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypothyroidism should always be checked in constipation cases. Low thyroid function slows all metabolic processes including gut motility. Many constipation cases resolve when thyroid is optimized."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "How does methane SIBO affect gut motility?",
            "options": [
                "It speeds up motility",
                "It has no effect on motility",
                "Methane gas directly slows gut motility",
                "It only affects the stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methane-producing archaea produce methane gas that directly slows gut motility. This leads to constipation, bloating, and incomplete evacuation. Treating methane SIBO often resolves chronic constipation."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "What is the difference between histamine intolerance and MCAS?",
            "options": [
                "They are the same condition",
                "HI = low DAO can't clear histamine; MCAS = overactive mast cells release many mediators",
                "HI is more serious than MCAS",
                "MCAS only affects the skin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Histamine intolerance: Low DAO enzyme can't clear dietary histamine. MCAS: Mast cells are overactive and release too many mediators (not just histamine). They often overlap but have different root causes."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Why is SIBO commonly connected to histamine issues?",
            "options": [
                "SIBO bacteria produce histamine and deplete DAO",
                "SIBO prevents histamine absorption",
                "There is no connection",
                "SIBO only affects serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bacteria in SIBO produce histamine as a byproduct. The inflammation and damage depletes DAO (the enzyme that breaks down histamine). Many SIBO patients develop histamine intolerance that resolves when SIBO is treated."
