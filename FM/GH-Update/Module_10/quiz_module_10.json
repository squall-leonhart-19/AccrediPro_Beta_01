            "question": "What is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and why does it matter for weight?",
            "options": [
                "A blood test measuring metabolism",
                "A ratio of gut bacteria; higher Firmicutes is linked to more efficient calorie extraction and obesity",
                "A measure of stomach acid",
                "A calculation for BMI"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The F/B ratio refers to the relative abundance of Firmicutes versus Bacteroidetes bacteria. Obese individuals often have higher Firmicutes ratios. Firmicutes are more efficient at extracting calories from food."

            "options": [
                "A type of food poisoning",
                "Chronic low levels of bacterial LPS in the bloodstream from leaky gut, causing inflammation and insulin resistance",

                "A genetic metabolic disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia refers to chronic low levels of LPS (lipopolysaccharides) in the bloodstream due to leaky gut. Even small amounts of LPS trigger inflammation and promote insulin resistance, contributing to metabolic syndrome."

            "question": "What foods increase Akkermansia muciniphila?",
            "options": [
                "Processed foods and sugar",
                "Antibiotics and PPIs",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Polyphenol-rich foods promote Akkermansia growth: cranberries, pomegranate, grape seed extract, and green tea. Prebiotic fibers like inulin also help. Intermittent fasting and moderate exercise support growth as well."

            "question": "How long does it take to break the sugar craving cycle by changing diet?",
            "options": [
                "1-2 days",
                "1 week",

                "6-12 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Breaking the sugar craving cycle typically requires 2-4 weeks of sugar restriction. During this time, sugar-loving bacteria and Candida decrease while beneficial bacteria increase. Die-off can cause temporary increased cravings before improvement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "About 20% of T4 to T3 conversion happens in the gut. This means gut health directly affects how much active thyroid hormone is available, regardless of what the thyroid gland produces."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic syndrome requires 3 of 5 criteria: 1) High waist circumference, 2) Elevated triglycerides (≥150), 3) Low HDL, 4) High blood pressure (≥130/85), 5) Elevated fasting glucose (≥100)."

                "It only kills parasites",
                "It improves blood sugar similar to metformin AND addresses gut dysbiosis",
                "It's a stimulant for weight loss",
                "It only helps with cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine has dual benefits: it improves blood sugar control comparable to metformin AND it's an antimicrobial that addresses gut dysbiosis. It also increases Akkermansia, reduces inflammation, and may help with weight loss."

                "Calorie counting doesn't work",
                "The microbiome adapts slowly (3-6 months) and can push back to old patterns",
                "Exercise is more important than diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The body defends its set point through metabolic adaptations. The microbiome adapts slowly and 'remembers' previous patterns, pushing you back. Sustainable change requires changing the microbiome itself, which takes 3-6 months."

            "options": [
                "Gluten causes Hashimoto's in everyone",
                "Gliadin (gluten protein) structurally resembles thyroid tissue, causing molecular mimicry",

                "There is no connection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gliadin (a protein in gluten) structurally resembles thyroid tissue. Through molecular mimicry, the immune system may attack both. Hashimoto's and celiac frequently co-occur, and gluten-free diets reduce thyroid antibodies in many patients."

                "5-10 lbs per week",
                "3-4 lbs per week",
                "1-2 lbs per week",
                "10+ lbs per month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable weight loss is 1-2 lbs per week maximum. This allows the microbiome time to adapt and helps prevent the metabolic adaptations that cause weight regain. Faster weight loss typically leads to faster regain."
