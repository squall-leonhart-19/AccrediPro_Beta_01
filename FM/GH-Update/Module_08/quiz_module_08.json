            "question": "Until what age is a child's microbiome considered to be actively developing?",
            "options": [
                "6 months",
                "1 year",
                "Around age 3",
                "Puberty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The microbiome is actively developing until around age 3. This critical window is shaped by birth method, feeding (breast vs. formula), antibiotic exposure, and environmental factors."

            "question": "What does 'start low, go slow' mean when working with elderly clients?",
            "options": [
                "Only work with them in the morning",
                "Start with lower supplement doses and increase gradually",
                "Have them walk slowly",
                "Lower their fiber intake permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Older adults often have reduced metabolism and clearance, increased sensitivity to changes, and potential medication interactions. Starting with lower doses and increasing slowly minimizes risks and adverse reactions."

            "question": "Why is constipation common during pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Pregnant women eat less fiber",
                "Progesterone relaxes smooth muscle and slows intestinal motility",
                "The baby sits on the colon",
                "It's not actually common"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone, a hormone elevated during pregnancy, relaxes smooth muscle throughout the body including the intestines. This slows motility and contributes to constipation. The growing uterus also adds physical compression."

            "question": "Why should athletes avoid NSAIDs before exercise?",
            "options": [
                "They slow performance",
                "NSAIDs damage gut lining, and combined with exercise-induced blood flow reduction, they significantly worsen leaky gut",
                "They cause dehydration",
                "They're banned in sports"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NSAIDs damage gut lining and increase intestinal permeability. Combined with exercise-induced blood flow diversion (up to 80% away from the gut), they significantly worsen leaky gut and increase systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fasano's Triad states autoimmunity requires: 1) Genetic predisposition, 2) Environmental trigger, and 3) Intestinal permeability (leaky gut). Addressing the gut is the factor we can most influence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90% of serotonin is produced in the gut by enterochromaffin cells. This highlights the significant impact gut health can have on mood, mental well-being, and conditions like anxiety and depression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SIBO is found at very high rates in CFS/ME patients—up to 77% in some studies. This likely contributes to nutrient malabsorption, B12 deficiency, and systemic inflammation that drives fatigue."

                "All antimicrobials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Generally safe in pregnancy: probiotics, ginger (in moderate amounts), fiber, and magnesium. Many herbs and high-dose vitamin A are contraindicated. Always verify safety before recommending anything during pregnancy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Up to 70% of endurance athletes experience GI issues during training/competition: cramping, nausea, diarrhea (runner's trots), side stitches, or reflux. This is caused by blood flow diversion, mechanical jostling, heat, and dehydration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to current research, intestinal permeability (leaky gut) is a necessary precondition for autoimmunity to develop. Addressing gut health can influence disease progression, even when genetic factors cannot be changed."
