            "question": "What is the key difference between therapeutic diets and general healthy eating advice?",
            "options": [
                "Therapeutic diets are more expensive",
                "Therapeutic diets are targeted, temporary interventions designed for specific conditions",
                "Therapeutic diets are always more restrictive",
                "There is no difference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic diets are targeted interventions designed to address specific dysfunction—like reducing bacterial fermentation or eliminating immune triggers. Unlike general healthy eating, they're meant to be temporary tools with planned reintroduction phases, not permanent restrictions."

            "question": "What are the 'Big 6-8' foods eliminated in a standard elimination diet?",
            "options": [
                "Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, vegetables",
                "Gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, corn, sugar, processed foods, alcohol/caffeine",
                "All grains, all vegetables, all fruits",
                "Only gluten and dairy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard elimination diet removes gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, corn, refined sugar, processed foods, and often alcohol/caffeine. These are the most common food sensitivities and removing them addresses the majority of food-related reactions."

            "question": "What does FODMAP stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Functional Oligosaccharides, Dietary Monosaccharides, And Proteins",
                "Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols",

                "Food-Origin Digestive Metabolic Acid Precursors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols. These are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed and fermented by gut bacteria, causing gas, bloating, and IBS symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Why should a low-FODMAP diet NOT be followed permanently?",
            "options": [
                "It's too expensive",
                "It starves beneficial bacteria (especially Bifidobacteria), reducing microbiome diversity",
                "It doesn't work long-term",
                "It causes weight gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term strict low-FODMAP starves beneficial bacteria because FODMAPs are their preferred fuel (they're prebiotics). This reduces microbiome diversity and can worsen gut health long-term. The goal is to identify specific triggers and liberalize the diet as much as possible."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "What is the core principle of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD)?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminate all fats",
                "Eliminate complex carbohydrates, allowing only monosaccharides",
                "Eat only raw foods",
                "Count calories precisely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCD eliminates complex carbohydrates (disaccharides, polysaccharides) and allows only monosaccharides. The theory is that complex carbs require digestion and when that's impaired, they feed pathogenic bacteria. Monosaccharides are directly absorbed without feeding bacteria."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a gut-healing food?",
            "options": [
                "Bone broth",
                "Refined vegetable oils",
                "Collagen/gelatin",
                "Foods rich in glutamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Refined vegetable oils (corn, soy, sunflower) are high in omega-6 fatty acids and are pro-inflammatory—the opposite of gut-healing. Bone broth, collagen/gelatin, and glutamine-rich foods all support intestinal barrier repair."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "What causes histamine intolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Eating too much protein",
                "DAO enzyme deficiency preventing adequate breakdown of dietary histamine",
                "Vitamin C deficiency",
                "Excess stomach acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Histamine intolerance occurs when DAO (diamine oxidase) is deficient. DAO is produced in the intestinal lining and breaks down dietary histamine. When the gut is damaged, DAO production decreases, and dietary histamine accumulates, causing symptoms across multiple body systems."

            "question": "Which FODMAP category includes garlic and onion?",
            "options": [
                "Disaccharides",
                "Polyols",
                "Oligosaccharides (fructans)",
                "Monosaccharides"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Garlic and onion are in the Oligosaccharides category, specifically fructans. This is the most common trigger category. Note: garlic- and onion-infused oils are often tolerated because fructans are water-soluble and don't transfer to oil."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "What is the simple meal template formula for therapeutic diets?",
            "options": [
                "Carbs + Carbs + More Carbs",
                "Quality protein + Non-starchy vegetables + Healthy fat + Optional starch",
                "Only protein and water",
                "Supplements only, no food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meal template is: Quality protein + Non-starchy vegetables + Healthy fat + Optional starch (based on protocol). This formula works across all therapeutic diets—just adjust which specific foods are included or excluded. It simplifies meal planning and ensures nutritional adequacy."

            "question": "When should you consider SCD or GAPS instead of simpler dietary interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Always start with SCD/GAPS for maximum effectiveness",
                "For IBD, severe SIBO, or when simpler interventions like low-FODMAP have failed",
                "Only for weight loss goals",
                "Never—they are outdated protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reserve SCD/GAPS for IBD (Crohn's/UC), severe SIBO when low-FODMAP wasn't sufficient, persistent complex dysbiosis, and cases where simpler interventions failed. Start conservatively with less restrictive diets first—match intervention intensity to condition severity."
