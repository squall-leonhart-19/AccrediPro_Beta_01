            "question": "What percentage of acne patients have gut dysbiosis?",
            "options": [
                "About 10%",
                "About 25%",
                "About 54%",
                "About 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show approximately 54% of acne patients have altered gut flora (dysbiosis). This highlights the importance of addressing gut health alongside topical treatments for acne."

                "A type of exercise for skin health",
                "The progression from eczema → food allergies → asthma → allergic rhinitis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The atopic march describes the typical progression of atopic conditions: eczema (usually in infancy) → food allergies → asthma → allergic rhinitis. Addressing gut health early can interrupt this progression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Up to 46% of rosacea patients test positive for SIBO—13 times higher than controls. In studies, treating SIBO led to complete or near-complete clearing of rosacea in over 90% of SIBO-positive patients."

            "question": "Why is dairy often problematic for acne?",
            "options": [
                "It contains too much calcium",
                "It increases IGF-1 which promotes sebum production",
                "It has too much vitamin D",
                "It causes dehydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dairy increases IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), which promotes sebum production and skin cell proliferation. Whey protein is especially problematic. This is why dairy elimination is often the first step in gut-based acne protocols."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psoriasis patients have 2-3 times higher rates of celiac disease than the general population. Additionally, many have gluten antibodies without full celiac. A gluten-free trial often significantly improves psoriasis."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Which nutrients support DAO enzyme function for histamine clearance?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium and magnesium",
                "Vitamin B6, copper, and vitamin C",

                "Vitamin E and selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B6, copper, and vitamin C are key cofactors for DAO (diamine oxidase) enzyme function. DAO breaks down histamine from food in the gut. Supporting these nutrients helps reduce histamine-related skin symptoms."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "How long does skin improvement typically take after addressing gut issues?",

                "6-12 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Skin improvement typically takes 4-12 weeks after gut issues are addressed. Skin cells turn over slowly, so internal changes take time to manifest externally. Setting this expectation early prevents discouragement."

            "id": "q9_8",

            "options": [
                "Skin becomes more hydrated",
                "Toxins exit through pores causing eruptions and inflammation",

                "Skin becomes more elastic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the liver and gut elimination pathways are overwhelmed (constipation, impaired detox, high toxin load), the body uses skin as a secondary elimination route. Toxins exit through pores, causing eruptions, rashes, and inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-histamine foods include: aged cheeses, wine, beer, fermented foods (sauerkraut, kombucha, kimchi), cured/smoked meats, vinegar, and canned or leftover fish/meat. Fresh foods are generally lower in histamine."
