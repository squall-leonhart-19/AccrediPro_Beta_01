            "question": "What are the three phases of liver detoxification?",
            "options": [
                "Ingestion, Digestion, Absorption",
                "Phase I (Functionalization), Phase II (Conjugation), Phase III (Transport)",
                "Preparation, Execution, Elimination",
                "Primary, Secondary, Tertiary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase I uses CYP450 enzymes to modify toxins. Phase II adds molecules to make them water-soluble. Phase III transports conjugated toxins out via bile or urine."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "What percentage of the liver's blood supply comes from the gut?",
            "options": [
                "20%",
                "50%",
                "70%",
                "90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "70% of the liver's blood supply comes from the gut via the portal vein. This means everything absorbed in the gut—nutrients and toxins—goes directly to the liver first."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "What is enterohepatic circulation?",
            "options": [
                "Blood flow between heart and liver",
                "The cycle where toxins in bile can be reabsorbed from the gut back to the liver",
                "Lymphatic drainage from the liver",
                "Nerve signaling between gut and liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Enterohepatic circulation is the cycle where toxins conjugated in liver are excreted in bile, enter the gut, and can be reabsorbed—especially if beta-glucuronidase breaks apart the conjugates."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Why is imbalanced Phase I (fast) and Phase II (slow) dangerous?",
            "options": [
                "It causes constipation",
                "Phase I creates more reactive intermediates that accumulate without Phase II processing them",
                "It raises blood pressure",
                "It depletes vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase I often creates MORE reactive intermediates than the original toxin. Without Phase II keeping up, these reactive compounds accumulate and cause oxidative damage and chemical sensitivity."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the estrobolome?",

                "A blood test for estrogen",

                "A type of estrogen receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is the collection of gut bacteria that metabolize estrogen. They produce beta-glucuronidase which can reactivate conjugated estrogen, directly influencing circulating levels."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "How does calcium-D-glucarate help with estrogen metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It produces more estrogen",
                "It inhibits beta-glucuronidase, preventing estrogen reabsorption",
                "It blocks estrogen receptors",
                "It converts testosterone to estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcium-D-glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, the enzyme that breaks apart conjugated estrogen in the gut. This allows estrogen to stay conjugated and be eliminated rather than reabsorbed."

            "question": "Why might Candida be associated with mercury toxicity?",
            "options": [
                "Mercury kills Candida",
                "Candida can sequester mercury as a survival strategy",
                "Candida produces mercury",
                "There is no connection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Candida can sequester mercury within its cell walls as a survival strategy. This is why stubborn Candida cases often have an underlying mercury burden—treating the metal may be necessary for resolution."

                "Drinking more water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Removing the exposure is the #1 priority. No amount of binders or supplements will resolve mold illness if the person continues to be exposed. Remediation or relocation is essential."

            "id": "q11_9",

            "options": [
                "Take high-dose vitamin C",
                "Start aggressive chelation",
                "Ensure elimination pathways are open (regular bowel movements, bile flow, hydration)",
                "Fast for 3 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'Open the drains before releasing the water.' Ensure elimination pathways work first—regular bowel movements, bile flow, hydration, kidney function—BEFORE mobilizing toxins."

            "options": [
                "Push through and increase doses",
                "Slow down, add binders, increase bowel movements and hydration",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Detox reactions mean going too fast. Slow down: reduce doses, take days off. Add binders to catch mobilized toxins. Increase bowel movements and hydration to enhance elimination."
