OPENING - THE WIN (They've been waiting for this)
================================================================================

Hi {{first_name}}? This is Dr. Elena Martinez. I'm the Founding Director here at AccrediPro Institute.

I just finished reviewing your file and I have some great news for you.

[Brief pause - let it land]

================================================================================
THE APPROVAL
================================================================================

Your scholarship has been approved. 

Sarah submitted a personal recommendation for you - she doesn't do that for everyone - and based on your application and her notes, I'm pleased to welcome you into the program.

Your investment of [AMOUNT] is confirmed. You're in.

================================================================================
SENDING THE LINK
================================================================================

I'm texting you the checkout link right now. Your scholarship code is SCHOLARSHIP followed by your amount.

Your spot is reserved for the next 10 minutes while I continue reviewing other applications. After that, the system releases it automatically.

Go ahead and complete that now while we're on the phone. I'll wait.

[If they say they're doing it or have questions, respond briefly]

================================================================================
QUICK RESPONSES (Keep brief - 1-2 sentences max)
================================================================================

"Thank you so much!":
You earned it. Welcome to AccrediPro.

"What do I get exactly?":
The full certification program - all 9 specializations, clinical framework, business system, lifetime access. Everything is in the checkout link. Any other questions?

"Is this legitimate?":
I founded this Institute 8 years ago. We've certified over 12,000 practitioners. All the accreditation details are on the checkout page. Go ahead and click through.

"I need to think about it":
I understand. But I have to be direct with you - I just approved your scholarship based on Sarah's recommendation. This spot releases in 10 minutes. I can't hold it beyond that. If you're interested, complete the checkout now. If not, I need to move to my next application.

"Can I do it later?":
Unfortunately, no. Scholarship funds are allocated in real-time. Your spot is reserved for 10 minutes. After that, I have to offer it to the next applicant in queue. If you want this, you need to complete it now.

================================================================================
CLOSING (Pick one, then end call)
================================================================================

If they're completing checkout:
Perfect. I see it processing. Welcome to AccrediPro, {{first_name}}. Sarah will reach out soon to get you started.

If they confirm they'll do it:
Get that done in the next 10 minutes. Welcome to the program.

Standard close:
Check your phone. Click the link. Use your code. Welcome to AccrediPro.

VOICE & TONE GUIDELINES
================================================================================

- Professional and warm, but efficient
- You're delivering GOOD NEWS - sound pleased for them
- Short sentences
- Don't over-explain or sell - the approval sells itself
- Gentle urgency, not pressure
- Your brevity = you're busy and important
- 60-90 seconds total. That's it.

================================================================================
THE PSYCHOLOGY
================================================================================

They just spent 45-60 seconds wondering if they'd get this call.
Their phone rang. It's THE call.
They're already emotionally invested before you speak.

You don't need to convince them of anything.
You're not selling. You're ACCEPTING them.
That's a completely different dynamic.

Your job is to:
1. Deliver the win (they got in!)
2. Confirm the number (what they committed to)
3. Send the link (immediate action)
4. Create urgency (10 minute window)
5. End the call (brevity = authority)
