        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 17px;"><strong>Connection to Your Journey:</strong> Throughout this module, you've explored professional practice foundations, scope of practice, legal considerations, ethical guidelines, collaboration with healthcare providers, confidentiality, and building referral networks. Now it's time to integrate all of this knowledge through realistic case studies. These scenarios will challenge you to apply your ethical reasoning to situations you may well encounter—situations where the "right" answer isn't always obvious, and where thoughtful judgment matters most.</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f9f5f5, #fff); border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin-bottom: 30px; border: 1px solid #e8d4d4;">
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 17px;">The ethical dilemmas that arise in health coaching rarely come with clear instructions. You won't find yourself thinking, "This is obviously a scope of practice violation." Instead, you'll face moments of uncertainty where multiple values seem to conflict—where helping the client seems to require stepping beyond your expertise, or where maintaining confidentiality feels like it might cause harm. These case studies are designed to develop your <span style="background: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px; font-weight: 500;">ethical reasoning capacity</span>—your ability to recognize dilemmas, analyze the competing considerations, and arrive at professionally sound decisions.</p>

    <!-- Case Study 1 -->

        <h2 style="margin: 0; font-size: 22px;">Case Study 1: The Supplement Suggestion</h2>
    </div>

    <!-- Scenario Box -->
    <div style="border: 2px solid #722F37; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0;">The Scenario</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Your client, Diane (52), has been working with you for two months on fatigue and brain fog. She's made dietary changes and improved her sleep, but she's frustrated that her energy hasn't bounced back. During your session, she mentions that she's heard B12 supplements can help with fatigue and asks, "Should I take B12? My friend takes it and says it changed her life."</p>
        <p style="margin: 15px 0 0 0; font-size: 15px;">You know that B12 deficiency is common, especially in women her age, and that supplementation is generally safe. You personally take B12 and have seen it help many clients. Her symptoms could absolutely be related to B12 levels. Part of you wants to say, "Yes, I think that's a great idea."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- The Dilemma -->
    <div style="background: #fff3e0; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #e65100; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">The Ethical Tension</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">You want to help Diane and believe supplementation might benefit her. However, recommending specific supplements for symptom treatment crosses into territory that requires clinical assessment. Fatigue and brain fog can have many causes—some serious. Without lab work to confirm deficiency, you're essentially guessing.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Analysis -->
    <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">Ethical Analysis</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Scope Considerations:</strong> Recommending supplements to treat symptoms falls outside the health coaching scope. While coaches can provide general education about nutrients, making personalized supplement recommendations based on symptoms constitutes treatment—a clinical function.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>What If She Takes It and Nothing Happens?</strong> She might miss underlying conditions that actually need attention. The supplement becomes a band-aid that delays proper diagnosis.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>What If Something Goes Wrong?</strong> While B12 is generally safe, you don't know her full medical picture. And if she has a reaction or her symptoms worsen, your recommendation could expose you to liability.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic;">"That's a great question, and I appreciate you thinking about what might support your energy. B12 is definitely important, and some people do find supplementation helpful. However, rather than guessing, I'd encourage you to ask your doctor about checking your B12 levels. That way, you'll know for sure if it's an issue, and if so, what dose makes sense. Fatigue and brain fog can have many causes, and having that information would help you make a more informed decision. Would you feel comfortable bringing this up at your next appointment?"</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 0; font-size: 22px;">Case Study 2: The Cry for Help</h2>
    </div>

    <!-- Scenario Box -->
    <div style="border: 2px solid #722F37; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0;">The Scenario</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Linda (47) has been your client for three months, working on stress management and emotional eating. Today's session feels different. She's tearful from the start, and when you ask what's going on, she says, "I just don't see the point anymore. I wake up every day and wonder why I bother." When you gently explore what she means, she admits that she's been having thoughts of "just not being here anymore"—but quickly adds, "I would never actually do anything. I just feel so hopeless."</p>
    </div>

    <!-- The Dilemma -->
    <div style="background: #fff3e0; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #e65100; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">The Ethical Tension</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Linda has disclosed suicidal ideation—thoughts of not wanting to live—but denies active intent or plan. She trusts you and has confided something she may not have shared with anyone else. You don't want to overreact and damage the relationship, but you also recognize this is serious. You're not a therapist and not trained to assess suicide risk. What's your responsibility here?</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Analysis -->
    <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">Ethical Analysis</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Scope Considerations:</strong> This is clearly outside health coaching scope. Suicidal ideation requires professional mental health assessment. Even if Linda denies active intent, she's describing hopelessness and a desire to not exist—these are serious warning signs.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Confidentiality Considerations:</strong> While we generally maintain client confidentiality, danger to self is an established exception. Linda's disclosure triggers an ethical obligation to ensure she gets appropriate help.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>The Relationship:</strong> How you handle this moment will affect whether Linda gets help and whether she continues to trust you. Responding with panic or immediate 911 calls may not be appropriate if she's not in immediate danger, but doing nothing isn't acceptable either.</p>
    </div>

        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic;">"Linda, I'm really glad you trusted me with this—it takes courage to share what you're feeling. What you're describing sounds incredibly painful, and I want to make sure you get the right support. These kinds of feelings are something a trained therapist can really help with. I'm not able to provide that kind of support as a health coach, but I don't want you to carry this alone."</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 15px;">Then, before ending the session:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; font-size: 15px;">

            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Provide resources: Share the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline number and therapist referrals from your network</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Create a safety plan: Ask her to commit to calling a crisis line or going to the ER if thoughts intensify</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Follow up: Schedule a check-in call within 24-48 hours</li>

        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0;">The Scenario</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Your client, Michelle (43), has been making wonderful progress addressing her autoimmune symptoms through anti-inflammatory nutrition and stress reduction. One day, you receive a phone call from her husband, Tom. "I'm Michelle's husband, and I need to know what you're telling her. She's refusing to take her medication because of something you said, and her doctor is furious. I pay for her coaching sessions, so I have a right to know what's going on."</p>

        <h3 style="color: #e65100; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">The Ethical Tension</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Tom is concerned about his wife and claims financial involvement. But you haven't spoken to Michelle about this, and you never advised her to stop her medication. Sharing information about your sessions would violate confidentiality—but refusing to engage might escalate the conflict at home. And you're troubled by the allegation that something you said is being used to justify stopping medication.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Analysis -->
    <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0;">
        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">Ethical Analysis</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Even though Tom pays for sessions, Michelle is your client. You cannot share information about her care without her explicit written consent—not even confirming that she's a client.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Scope:</strong> Health coaches don't advise clients to stop medications. If Michelle interpreted something you said that way, this needs to be addressed directly with her.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Client Welfare:</strong> If Michelle has stopped medication against medical advice, she may be at risk. You have an obligation to address this—but through proper channels, not through her husband.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Recommended Response -->
    <div style="background: #f0f7f0; border-radius: 10px; padding: 25px; margin: 25px 0; border-left: 4px solid #2e7d32;">
        <h3 style="color: #2e7d32; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">✓ A Professional Response</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>To Tom:</strong> <em>"I appreciate your concern for Michelle. However, I'm not able to discuss anything about my work with any client—including confirming whether someone is a client—without their explicit written permission. I'd encourage you to talk directly with Michelle about your concerns. If she'd like me to speak with you, she can let me know and sign a release."</em></p>
        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>Then, follow up with Michelle:</strong> Contact her to discuss what happened. Clarify that you never advised stopping medication. Explore what she understood from your sessions. Emphasize the importance of working with her doctor on any medication decisions. Document the conversation carefully.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Your close friend Sarah introduces you to her neighbor, Rachel, at a dinner party. Rachel mentions she's been struggling with hormonal issues and asks if you might be able to help her. Sarah enthusiastically endorses you: "She's amazing! She completely transformed my health." Rachel is eager to start right away and offers to pay you cash—no paperwork needed. "It would be so easy since we already know each other through Sarah," she says.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Rachel's connection to your friend creates a <span style="background: #FFF59D; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 3px; font-weight: 500;">dual relationship</span>—you'd be both a friend-of-friend and her health coach. The informal approach (cash, no paperwork) feels convenient but bypasses professional protections. And you're being put on the spot in a social situation.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Boundary Concerns:</strong> Working with friends-of-friends creates potential complications. What happens if information Rachel shares in sessions becomes awkward in your friendship with Sarah? What if Rachel is dissatisfied—does that affect your relationship with Sarah?</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Professional Standards:</strong> "No paperwork" means no informed consent, no documentation, no clear agreements. This exposes both you and Rachel. It's also not how professional practice works.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Social Pressure:</strong> Making business decisions at dinner parties, under social pressure, rarely leads to good outcomes.</p>

That way I can explain my process properly and you can decide if it's right for you."</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;">Jennifer is reaching out for guidance on what is potentially a medical emergency. She trusts you, which is why she texted.

        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Scope:</strong> Assessing symptoms and advising on emergency care is absolutely not within your scope. This is a medical situation.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><strong>Risk:</strong> Severe, worsening abdominal pain can indicate serious conditions—appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, bowel obstruction—that require immediate care. "Wait and see" advice from you could delay life-saving treatment.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Boundaries:</strong> This also touches on availability boundaries. Clients texting at 10 PM on weekends about medical symptoms suggests unclear expectations about your role and availability.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> In your next session, gently clarify your availability and scope. Ensure Jennifer understands that medical symptoms always require medical attention, not coaching input.</p>

    <!-- When to Seek Consultation -->

        <h3 style="color: #722F37; margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 18px;">When to Seek Consultation</h3>
        <p style="margin: 0 0 15px 0; font-size: 15px;">You don't have to navigate every dilemma alone. Seek consultation when:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">The situation involves potential harm to the client or others</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">You're uncertain about legal obligations (consult an attorney)</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">The dilemma is complex and multiple approaches seem reasonable</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Your emotions are clouding your judgment</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">You're facing something you've never encountered before</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin: 15px 0 0 0; font-size: 15px;">Build relationships with mentors, supervisors, or peer consultation groups who can provide guidance. Professional isolation is a risk factor for ethical missteps.</p>

                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Dilemmas Require Judgment:</strong> Ethical situations rarely have obvious answers—they require careful analysis and professional reasoning</p>

                <span style="font-size: 20px;">🤝</span>
                <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Referral is a Skill:</strong> Knowing when and how to refer is a core competency, not an admission of limitation</p>
