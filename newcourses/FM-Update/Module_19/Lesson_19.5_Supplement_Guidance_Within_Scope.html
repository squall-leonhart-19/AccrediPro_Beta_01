    <!-- Opening Story -->
    <div>
        <h3>📖 Coaching Story: Teresa's Supplement Confusion</h3>
        <p>Teresa, a 44-year-old client, arrived with a shopping bag full of supplements. "I've been reading about functional medicine and ordered all these. Vitamin D, omega-3s, probiotics, adaptogens, liver support, adrenal support—I don't even know what half of them are for. Can you tell me which ones I should take?"</p>
        <p>This moment presents both an opportunity and a boundary challenge. Teresa needs guidance, but simply prescribing a supplement regimen would exceed coaching scope. Instead, we explored her goals, discussed what she'd learned about each supplement, reviewed general safety considerations, and identified which decisions required her healthcare provider's input.</p>
        <p>Teresa left with a clearer understanding of her supplements, questions to ask her doctor, and confidence in the distinction between <span class="highlight">general wellness support</span> and clinical treatment—exactly what coaching scope allows.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Understanding Scope: The Critical Distinction</h2>

    <p>Supplement guidance is one of the areas where coaching scope requires careful navigation. The distinction isn't about what supplements do, but about <span class="highlight">the context and intent</span> of your guidance.</p>

    <h3>What Health Coaches CAN Do</h3>

    <div>
        <h4>Within Coaching Scope ✓</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide general education</strong> about how supplements work, common uses, and general safety considerations</li>
            <li><strong>Discuss food-based sources</strong> of nutrients and when food alone may or may not be sufficient</li>
            <li><strong>Support implementation</strong> of supplement protocols prescribed by licensed providers</li>
            <li><strong>Share general wellness information</strong> about widely-used supplements (like vitamin D, omega-3s, magnesium)</li>
            <li><strong>Guide quality selection</strong> by explaining third-party testing, form differences, and label reading</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage provider consultation</strong> for clinical decisions</li>
            <li><strong>Help track subjective responses</strong> to supplements clients are taking</li>
            <li><strong>Discuss relevant research</strong> in general educational terms</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>What Health Coaches Should NOT Do</h3>

    <div>
        <h4>Outside Coaching Scope ✗</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prescribe supplements to treat conditions:</strong> "Take this for your thyroid problem"</li>
            <li><strong>Recommend specific dosages for clinical issues:</strong> "You need 5,000 IU of vitamin D for your deficiency"</li>
            <li><strong>Advise stopping prescribed medications:</strong> "You can replace that with a supplement"</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnose nutrient deficiencies:</strong> "Your symptoms mean you're deficient in B12"</li>
            <li><strong>Create clinical supplement protocols:</strong> Detailed therapeutic regimens based on labs</li>
            <li><strong>Override provider recommendations:</strong> "That supplement your doctor suggested isn't good"</li>
            <li><strong>Promise therapeutic outcomes:</strong> "This supplement will cure your condition"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="caution-box">
        <h4>⚠️ The Key Question: Intent and Context</h4>
        <p>Ask yourself: Am I providing general wellness education, or am I diagnosing and treating? Am I supporting a client's autonomy and informed decision-making, or am I prescribing? The same information can be appropriate or inappropriate depending on how it's framed and why it's being shared.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Language Matters: How to Discuss Supplements Appropriately</h2>

    <p>The words you choose when discussing supplements can determine whether you're staying within scope. Here's how to reframe common conversations:</p>

    <div>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Outside Scope (Prescriptive)</th>
                    <th>Within Scope (Educational)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>"You need to take magnesium for your anxiety."</td>
                    <td>"Research suggests magnesium may support nervous system function. Many people find it helpful. This would be worth discussing with your provider."</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"Take 5,000 IU of vitamin D."</td>
                    <td>"Vitamin D needs vary by individual. Your provider can test your levels and recommend the right amount for you."</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"This probiotic will fix your gut issues."</td>
                    <td>"Probiotics are widely studied for digestive support. There are many different strains—your practitioner can help determine if one might be appropriate for you."</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>"You're deficient in iron."</td>
                    <td>"Some of what you describe can be associated with low iron. Have you had your iron levels checked? That's something your provider could test."</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <h2>Categories of Supplement Discussions</h2>

    <h3>General Wellness Supplements: Lower Risk</h3>

    <p>Some supplements have extensive safety data and are commonly used for general wellness. These are often appropriate for educational discussion:</p>

    <div>

        <div>
            <h4>Vitamin D</h4>
            <p><strong>General Education:</strong> Widely studied, many people are insufficient, supports bone health, immune function, mood. Testing is readily available.</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Role:</strong> Encourage testing, discuss sun exposure and food sources, explain that supplementation needs are individual.</p>
            <p><strong>Refer When:</strong> Client needs specific dosing, has medical conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism, or is taking medications that interact.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h4>
            <p><strong>General Education:</strong> Essential fats the body cannot make, support cardiovascular, brain, and inflammatory balance. Available from fish and algae sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Role:</strong> Discuss food sources, explain EPA vs. DHA, guide quality selection (third-party tested, low oxidation).</p>
            <p><strong>Refer When:</strong> Client is on blood thinners, has bleeding disorders, needs therapeutic dosing for specific conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Magnesium</h4>
            <p><strong>General Education:</strong> Involved in 300+ enzymatic reactions, many people don't meet RDA through food, various forms for different purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Role:</strong> Discuss food sources, explain form differences (glycinate for calm, citrate for digestion, etc.), general safety.</p>
            <p><strong>Refer When:</strong> Kidney disease, cardiac conditions, taking medications that affect magnesium, need clinical dosing.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Probiotics</h4>
            <p><strong>General Education:</strong> Beneficial bacteria that support gut microbiome, many strains with different effects, generally well-tolerated.</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Role:</strong> Discuss fermented foods, explain strain specificity, general quality considerations.</p>
            <p><strong>Refer When:</strong> Severe immune compromise, SIBO concerns, need condition-specific strain selection, complex digestive issues.</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Clinical Supplements: Higher Complexity</h3>

    <p>Some supplements require more clinical oversight due to potency, interactions, or condition-specific use:</p>

    <div>

        <div>
            <h4>Herbs and Botanicals</h4>
            <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Active compounds can interact with medications, vary in potency, have condition-specific contraindications.</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Approach:</strong> General education only. Always encourage provider consultation before use, especially with medications or health conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Hormonal Precursors</h4>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> DHEA, pregnenolone, melatonin at high doses</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Approach:</strong> These affect hormone levels and should be supervised by providers. Education about what they are is appropriate; recommending use is not.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Therapeutic Protocols</h4>
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Gut protocols, detox protocols, antimicrobial protocols</p>
            <p><strong>Coaching Approach:</strong> These are clinical interventions. Coaches can support implementation of provider-prescribed protocols but should not design therapeutic supplement protocols independently.</p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h2>Guiding Quality Selection</h2>

    <p>When clients are going to take supplements (whether self-directed or provider-recommended), guiding them toward <span class="highlight">quality products</span> is an appropriate coaching function.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Testing and Certification</h3>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h4>What to Look For</h4>
        <div>
            <div>
                <strong>NSF Certified for Sport / NSF International:</strong>
                <p>Tests for contaminants, verifies label accuracy, ongoing manufacturing audits</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>USP Verified:</strong>
                <p>Tests for identity, potency, purity, and dissolution; pharmacopeia standards</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>ConsumerLab Approved:</strong>
                <p>Independent testing for product quality, ingredient accuracy, contamination</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>GMP Certified:</strong>
                <p>Good Manufacturing Practices—baseline quality standard, not third-party ingredient testing</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Understanding Supplement Forms</h3>

                    <td>Glycinate and threonate well-absorbed, less GI effect; citrate supports bowels; oxide poorly absorbed</td>
                </tr>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Vitamin D</strong></td>

    <h2>Common Client Scenarios</h2>

    <div>
        <h4>Scenario 1: "What supplements should I take?"</h4>
        <p><strong>Appropriate Response:</strong></p>
        <p>"That's a great question, and the answer really depends on your individual situation. Supplements can be helpful, but what's right for one person isn't right for another. Let's talk about your goals and what you're hoping to support. For anything beyond basic wellness support, I'd recommend working with your healthcare provider, especially since they can test for deficiencies and consider your complete health picture. I can share some general information about what various supplements do, and I can help you implement whatever your provider recommends."</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Scenario 2: "My friend recommended this supplement for my [condition]."</h4>
        <p><strong>Appropriate Response:</strong></p>
        <p>"I understand wanting to explore options, and it's wonderful that your friend was trying to help. When it comes to supplements for specific health conditions, that's really something to discuss with your healthcare provider. They can determine if it's appropriate for you, check for any interactions with medications, and suggest the right form and dose. I'm happy to help you prepare questions for that conversation."</p>
    </div>

        <h4>Scenario 3: "I'm already taking these supplements. Can you tell me if they're good quality?"</h4>
        <p><strong>Appropriate Response:</strong></p>
        <p>"I can help you evaluate the quality of your supplements. Let's look at whether they have third-party testing, what forms of nutrients they use, and if the doses align with what your provider recommended. Some things to look for are certifications like NSF, USP, or ConsumerLab approval. Would you like to go through your supplements together?"</p>

    <h2>Documentation Best Practices</h2>

    <p>Proper documentation protects you and creates clarity about the scope of your supplement discussions.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h4>Documentation Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Document nature of discussion:</strong> "Provided general education about..." vs. "Recommended client take..."</li>
            <li><strong>Note referrals made:</strong> "Encouraged client to discuss with provider before starting..."</li>
            <li><strong>Record client self-directed choices:</strong> "Client reported independently deciding to start..."</li>
            <li><strong>Track implementation support:</strong> "Helped client create schedule for provider-prescribed supplements..."</li>
            <li><strong>Note any concerns:</strong> "Client reported new symptom since starting [supplement]—advised contacting provider"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>When to Refer</h2>

    <p>Know when supplement decisions require provider involvement:</p>

    <div class="caution-box">
