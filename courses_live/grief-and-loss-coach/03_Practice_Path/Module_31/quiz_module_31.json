            "question": "In trauma-informed copywriting (L1), why is the traditional 'Problem-Agitate-Solve' (PAS) marketing framework often criticized in the grief coaching niche?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to implement in digital advertising.",
                "It intentionally heightens emotional distress in vulnerable individuals to force a sale.",
                "It focuses too much on the solution rather than the client's current pain.",
                "It is ineffective because grief cannot be 'solved' by a coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed marketing avoids 'agitation' because it can re-traumatize potential clients. Ethical marketing in this space focuses on empathy and safety rather than exploiting emotional pain for conversion."

                "It reduces competition and increases 'Expert Authority' by speaking to a specific, underserved experience.",
                "It ensures that the coach will never have to deal with complex trauma cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-niching (e.g., grief for pet loss or career-related loss) allows a coach to become a specialist, which builds authority faster and attracts clients who feel the coach specifically understands their unique situation."
