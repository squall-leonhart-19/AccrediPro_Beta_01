                "Coaching focuses on the past and resolving childhood trauma, while therapy focuses on the future.",
                "Coaching is primarily future-oriented and focuses on integration and functional growth, whereas therapy addresses clinical pathology and diagnostic symptoms.",
                "Coaching allows for the prescription of medication for sleep disturbances, while therapy does not.",
                "There is no functional distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in professional practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional grief coaching is distinguished by its focus on post-traumatic growth, integration, and forward-moving life design, rather than the clinical diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders found in psychotherapy."

            "question": "In the neurobiology of grief (Lesson 2), what specific structural change is often observed in the brain during the acute phase of bereavement?",

                "Complete cessation of HPA axis activity resulting in low cortisol levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurobiological studies show that acute grief often triggers amygdala hyperactivity (the 'fear center') and a functional decoupling or hypoactivity in the Prefrontal Cortex, which explains the 'brain fog' and emotional dysregulation clients experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model emphasizes 'oscillation' as the key to healthy grieving, where the individual moves back and forth between processing the loss and engaging in the practicalities of a changed life."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, or 'Broken Heart Syndrome,' involves a temporary change in the heart's shape (apical ballooning) due to a surge of stress hormones like adrenaline."
