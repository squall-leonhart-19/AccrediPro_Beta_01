            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Amygdala, the brain's emotional smoke detector, becomes hyperactive during grief, triggering the HPA axis and keeping the body in a state of high stress and hypervigilance."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Those with anxious attachment often struggle with the 'separation' aspect of loss, leading to persistent yearning and a higher risk of chronic, prolonged grief."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model posits that healthy coping requires 'oscillation'—the fluid movement between facing the loss and attending to the practicalities of a changed life."
