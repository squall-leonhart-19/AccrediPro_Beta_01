            "question": "In the context of Perinatal and Neonatal Loss, why is this type of grief frequently categorized as 'disenfranchised'?",
            "options": [
                "Because the loss occurs before the child has reached legal adulthood",
                "Because society often lacks public rituals for these losses and may minimize the depth of the attachment",
                "Because the medical community does not recognize miscarriage as a traumatic event",
                "Because the parents are expected to recover more quickly than from other types of loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perinatal loss is often 'invisible' because there is a lack of societal validation and public ritual, leading others to minimize the loss, which results in disenfranchised grief for the parents."

                "An intensive, often circular search for 'Why' and the presence of profound 'survivor guilt'",
                "The complete lack of somatic symptoms during the first six months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicide loss is characterized by a complex search for meaning ('the why') and significant levels of guilt and stigma that are less prevalent in natural deaths."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Survivors of overdose loss face a 'double stigma': the societal judgment of the substance use disorder itself and the often-stigmatized nature of an accidental or intentional overdose."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because pet loss is often disenfranchised, the coach's primary role is to validate the attachment and normalize the client's intense emotional response."
