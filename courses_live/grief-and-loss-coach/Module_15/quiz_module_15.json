            "question": "According to the neurobiological perspective on meaning-making, which brain region is primarily responsible for integrating emotional data from the amygdala into a coherent 'self-narrative'?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)",

                "The Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC is critical for 'top-down' emotional regulation and the integration of emotional experiences into a coherent personal narrative, which is the foundation of meaning-making."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "PTG does not imply the absence of grief or distress; rather, it is growth that occurs *because* of the struggle with the trauma. The five domains are: Personal Strength, New Possibilities, Spiritual Change, Relating to Others, and Appreciation of Life."
