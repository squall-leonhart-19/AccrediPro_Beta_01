            "question": "In the context of Existential Grief (L1), Victor Frankl's logotherapy suggests that the primary human drive is not pleasure, but the 'will to meaning.' When a client experiences an existential vacuum following a loss, what is the coach's primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "To provide the client with a new set of religious beliefs to fill the void",
                "To facilitate the discovery of potential meaning in the client's unique life circumstances",
                "To distract the client from 'why' questions by focusing on daily routines",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Existential coaching focuses on facilitating the client's own discovery of meaning (Logotherapy) rather than imposing external beliefs or avoiding the existential questions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Physically Present but Mentally Absent' (Type Two Ambiguous Loss) is discussed. Why is this type of loss particularly difficult for the 'boundary ambiguity' of a family system?",
            "options": [
                "Because the person is dead and the family cannot accept it",

                "Because there is no physical body to care for",
                "Because the legal system does not recognize the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boundary ambiguity occurs because the family is unsure of the roles; the person is physically there but cannot fulfill their previous psychological or functional roles (e.g., in dementia)."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "This scenario often encompasses ambiguous loss (identity change), secondary losses (imagined futures), and can be disenfranchised if the client feels they cannot openly mourn."
