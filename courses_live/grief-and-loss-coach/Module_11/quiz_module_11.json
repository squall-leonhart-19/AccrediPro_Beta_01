            "options": [
                "The inhibition of the amygdala by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The mPFC is responsible for top-down regulation of the amygdala, allowing the brain to process emotional data into a structured, temporal sequence (narrative)."

                "Meaning-finding is passive; meaning-making is an active, creative reconstruction of the self-narrative.",
                "Meaning-finding is for spiritual loss; meaning-making is for physical loss.",
                "There is no distinction; they are used interchangeably in clinical practice.",
                "Meaning-making is only possible after the first year of bereavement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neimeyer emphasizes that meaning is not just 'found' like a lost object, but actively 'made' through the reconstruction of one's life story following a loss."
