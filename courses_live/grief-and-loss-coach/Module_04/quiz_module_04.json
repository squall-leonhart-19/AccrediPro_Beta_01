            "question": "Which neurobiological mechanism is primarily responsible for the 'brain fog' and memory impairment often seen in acute grief, due to prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels?",
            "options": [
                "The upregulation of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Atrophy or suppressed neurogenesis in the hippocampus",
                "Decreased activity in the amygdala",
                "Increased myelination of the corpus callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that chronic activation of the HPA axis during bereavement leads to sustained high cortisol, which can inhibit neurogenesis and cause dendritic shrinkage in the hippocampus, the brain's primary center for memory and spatial navigation."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the DSM-5-TR, what is the minimum duration of symptoms required to diagnose an adult with Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5-TR specifies that for adults, the grief response must persist for at least 12 months after the death to meet the diagnostic criteria for PGD; for children and adolescents, the timeframe is 6 months."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'emotional numbness,' a sense of being 'frozen,' and low energy. According to Polyvagal Theory, which state of the nervous system are they likely experiencing?",

                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic Adrenal (Fight or Flight)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal complex is associated with the 'freeze' response, immobilization, and metabolic conservation, often manifesting as numbness, dissociation, or lethargy in grieving individuals."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with an anxious-preoccupied attachment style often experience higher levels of separation anxiety and have more difficulty reaching a state of integration, leading to prolonged and intense mourning trajectories."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a person's loss cannot be openly acknowledged, socially validated, or publicly observed, such as the death of an ex-spouse, a pet, or a loss through suicide or stigmatized causes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restoration-oriented stressors involve the secondary consequences of the loss, such as taking on new roles, mastering new skills, or dealing with practical life changes, rather than focusing directly on the emotional loss itself."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Hyper-arousal,' characterized by panic attacks, intrusive images, and emotional flooding. According to the Window of Tolerance model, what is the primary coaching goal?",

                "Push the client to explore deeper traumas to 'break through' the panic",
                "Utilize grounding and stabilization techniques to return the client to their Window of Tolerance",
                "Encourage the client to increase their heart rate through vigorous exercise",
                "Ignore the physical symptoms and focus only on cognitive reframing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is hyper-aroused (outside the Window of Tolerance), the immediate priority is stabilization and grounding to bring the nervous system back to a state where cognitive processing can occur."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios represents a 'Clinical Boundary' where a Grief Coach must refer the client to a licensed mental health professional?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation, intent, or planning is a critical safety issue that falls outside the scope of coaching and requires immediate referral to clinical or emergency services."

                "Competence is about knowing facts; Humility is an ongoing process of self-reflection and learning",
                "Competence is for therapists; Humility is for coaches",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable",
                "Humility is about memorizing all cultural traditions; Competence is about empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility is a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and critique, acknowledging that one can never be 'fully competent' in another's culture, whereas competence often implies a finite endpoint of knowledge."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy involves a sudden weakening of the left ventricle, often triggered by severe grief; it presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, closely mimicking a myocardial infarction despite no blocked arteries."
