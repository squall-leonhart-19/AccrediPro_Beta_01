            "question": "According to the DSM-5-TR criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), how long must a bereaved adult experience symptoms of intense yearning or preoccupation before a clinical diagnosis can be considered?",
            "options": [
                "At least 3 months following the loss",
                "At least 6 months following the loss",
                "At least 12 months following the loss",
                "At least 24 months following the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5-TR specifies a minimum duration of 12 months for adults (6 months for children/adolescents) before a diagnosis of Prolonged Grief Disorder can be made, distinguishing it from acute grief."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of traumatic loss (homicide or suicide), what is the primary reason that 'meaning-making' is often delayed compared to natural deaths?",
            "options": [
                "The mourner is usually in denial for several years",
                "Intrusive trauma symptoms and 'why' questions block the integration of the loss",
                "Social support is typically higher, removing the need for meaning-making",
                "Legal proceedings prevent the mourner from speaking about the deceased"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic loss often involves 'shattered assumptions' and intrusive imagery. The cognitive load of processing the 'how' and 'why' of a violent death often interferes with the 'meaning-making' phase of grief."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Kenneth Doka’s concept of 'Disenfranchised Grief' applies to which of the following case study scenarios?",

                "A widow receiving community support after her husband's long illness",
                "A father mourning the death of his adult son in a car accident",
                "A woman mourning the death of a secret extramarital partner",
                "A child mourning the death of a grandparent"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when the relationship, the loss, or the mourner is not socially recognized or sanctioned. A secret relationship is a classic example of an 'invisible' loss."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a spouse who has advanced Stage 7 Alzheimer’s. The client states, 'He is here, but he isn't here.' According to Pauline Boss, which type of Ambiguous Loss is this?",

                "Type I: Physical Absence with Psychological Presence",
                "Type II: Physical Presence with Psychological Absence",

                "Type IV: Developmental Regression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type II Ambiguous Loss occurs when the person is physically present (the body is there) but psychologically absent (due to cognitive decline, addiction, or mental illness)."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A 6-year-old client exhibits 'grief puddling' after the loss of a sibling. What behavior should the coach expect to see based on this developmental concept?",
            "options": [
                "The child remains in a state of deep depression for several weeks without respite",
                "The child displays an adult-like understanding of the permanence of death",
                "The child switches rapidly between intense crying and playing happily",
                "The child refuses to speak about the deceased sibling entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children often experience grief in 'puddles' rather than 'oceans.' They may have brief, intense bursts of grief but can quickly pivot back to play and normal developmental activities."

                "Practice cultural humility by asking the client to explain the significance of their rituals",
                "Assume all members of that culture grieve in the exact same way",
                "Refer the client to a therapist of the same ethnic background immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence involves cultural humility—acknowledging you are not the expert on the client's specific cultural experience and allowing them to lead the narrative regarding their rituals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize the boundaries of their practice. Signs of clinical depression, substance abuse, or suicidal ideation require an immediate referral to a licensed therapist or crisis service."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that survivors of suicide loss have a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideation and behavior themselves, necessitating specialized support and monitoring."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key differentiator between 'Normal' Grief and Prolonged Grief Disorder in a case study evaluation?",
            "options": [

                "The loss of interest in social activities for the first 2 months",
                "The inability to function in social, occupational, or other important areas after 12 months",
                "Thinking about the deceased person every day"

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While sadness and daily thoughts are normal in grief, PGD is specifically characterized by functional impairment that persists beyond the 12-month mark (for adults)."
