            "question": "According to the Dual Process Model (Stroebe & Schut), what is the primary mechanism that facilitates healthy adaptation to loss?",
            "options": [
                "The sequential progression through five linear stages of grief.",
                "The dynamic oscillation between loss-orientation and restoration-orientation.",
                "The complete detachment from the deceased to focus on new relationships.",
                "The suppression of negative emotions to maintain social functioning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model emphasizes 'oscillation,' where the individual moves between confronting the loss and focusing on life changes (restoration), which research suggests is more adaptive than focusing on only one aspect."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Neuroimaging research by Mary-Frances O’Connor (fMRI) found that individuals with Complicated Grief (now PGD) showed specific activation in which brain region when viewing photos of the deceased?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex, indicating logical processing.",
                "The Nucleus Accumbens, associated with reward and 'craving'.",
                "The Occipital Lobe, indicating purely visual processing.",
                "The Cerebellum, indicating motor memory only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research found that in those with complicated grief, the Nucleus Accumbens (the brain's reward center) is activated, suggesting that the yearning for the deceased functions similarly to a biological craving or addiction."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In a landmark randomized controlled trial by Shear et al. (2005), how did Prolonged Grief Disorder Therapy (PGDT) compare to Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)?",
            "options": [
                "Both treatments showed identical recovery rates of 45%.",
                "IPT was significantly more effective in reducing core grief symptoms.",
                "PGDT had a response rate of approximately 70%, nearly double that of IPT.",
                "Neither treatment was found to be more effective than a placebo."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study showed that PGDT, which specifically targets grief-related blocks, had a 70% response rate compared to 32% for IPT, proving that specialized grief interventions outperform general depression treatments."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "When using the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) for psychometric assessment, what is the generally accepted clinical cutoff score indicating a need for professional intervention?",

                "A score of 10 or higher.",
                "A score of 15 or higher.",

                "A score of 50 or higher."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In clinical research, a score of 25 or higher on the ICG is the standard threshold used to identify individuals experiencing Complicated Grief/PGD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meaning Reconstruction focuses on the narrative process—how the survivor makes sense of the death and integrates it into their ongoing life story."

            "options": [
                "The grief is so intense it requires pharmacological intervention.",
                "The loss cannot be openly acknowledged, socially sanctioned, or publicly mourned.",
                "The grief occurs only after the loss of a biological parent.",
                "The grief is resolved within the first three months of the loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when society does not recognize the person's right to grieve (e.g., loss of an ex-spouse, a pet, or a stigmatized death), which complicates the healing process."

            "options": [
                "Are the most effective way to reduce the 'yearning' component of grief.",
                "Reduce co-occurring depressive symptoms but do not significantly reduce core grief symptoms.",
                "Have no effect on bereaved individuals whatsoever.",
                "Are superior to PGDT in all clinical outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While SSRIs can help with the 'depressive' symptoms associated with bereavement, they do not target the specific 'grief' symptoms like yearning and preoccupation with the deceased."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Digital Thanatology,' what does research suggest regarding the impact of social media 'memorial pages'?",
            "options": [
                "They are universally harmful and delay the grieving process.",
                "They have no impact on the modern bereavement experience.",
                "They facilitate 'Continuing Bonds' but may also lead to 'Digital Grave Robbing' or privacy issues.",
                "They are only used by younger generations (Gen Z) and do not affect older adults."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digital platforms allow for a new form of communal mourning and continuing bonds, though they present unique challenges regarding privacy and the permanence of digital remains."

            "explanation": "Research indicates that the risk of myocardial infarction or Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is significantly elevated (up to 21 times higher) in the first 24 hours following the death of a loved one due to acute emotional stress."
