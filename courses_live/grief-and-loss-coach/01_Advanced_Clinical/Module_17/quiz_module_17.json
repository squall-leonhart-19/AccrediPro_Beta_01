                "It is always resolved within six months of the initial event."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In traumatic grief, the trauma symptoms (PTSD-like responses) often 'block' the ability to grieve. The trauma must be stabilized before the client can effectively process the mourning."

                "Tell the client that their culture's views are incorrect.",
                "Validate the loss and provide a 'counter-narrative' that honors their specific cultural mourning rituals.",

            "explanation": "Validating the client's unique cultural or marginalized experience and providing a safe space for their specific rituals is essential in addressing disenfranchised grief."
