            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) as defined by the DSM-5-TR, including an inability to return to work 14 months after a loss. What is the ethically appropriate action for a Grief Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Continue coaching but increase session frequency to three times per week.",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional for clinical intervention.",
                "Implement a strict 'positive thinking' protocol to bypass the depression.",
                "Diagnose the client with PGD and begin a clinical treatment plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grief coaches must recognize the scope of practice; clinical diagnoses like PGD require a licensed therapist or psychiatrist. Coaching focuses on forward-moving support, not treating clinical pathology."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that 'Grief Brain' can significantly impair cognitive function during acute bereavement. How does this impact the ethical process of informed consent?",
            "options": [
                "Informed consent is not necessary during the first six months of grief.",
                "The coach should make all decisions for the client until the fog clears.",
                "Consent should be treated as an ongoing process, frequently revisited to ensure the client truly understands the agreement.",
                "The coach should wait at least one year before signing a formal coaching contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because high cortisol levels and cognitive 'fog' affect memory and decision-making in acute grief, ethical practitioners revisit the informed consent document regularly to ensure the client remains a voluntary participant."

        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A coach notices they are feeling an intense, protective 'parental' urge toward a young client who lost their mother. This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the coach projects their own emotional needs or past experiences onto the client. Recognizing this is vital for maintaining professional boundaries."

            "options": [
                "Using any free platform that the client finds convenient.",
                "Ensuring the platform is HIPAA-compliant or meets equivalent end-to-end encryption standards.",
                "Recording all sessions without the client's knowledge for 'quality assurance.'",
                "Conducting sessions in a public space like a coffee shop to normalize grief."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical digital practice requires maintaining client confidentiality through secure, encrypted platforms to protect sensitive data during vulnerable sessions."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "According to the principles of Cultural Humility, how should a coach approach a client from a different ethnic background?",
            "options": [
                "By memorizing a list of 'standard' mourning rituals for that specific culture.",
                "By assuming the client's experience will match the coach's previous research.",
                "By adopting a 'learner' stance and asking the client how their culture influences their personal grief.",
                "By ignoring cultural differences to treat every client exactly the same."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility involves a lifelong commitment to self-critique and a 'learner' stance, acknowledging that the client is the expert on their own cultural experience."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A former client asks to join a private, non-grief-related social club where you are a founding member. Why might this be considered an unethical dual relationship?",
            "options": [
                "Because the coach cannot charge the client for social time.",
                "Because it blurs the power dynamic and may compromise the client's emotional safety or the coach's objectivity.",
                "Because former clients are legally prohibited from ever socializing with their coaches.",
                "It is only unethical if the client is still paying for coaching services."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships can create conflicts of interest and compromise professional neutrality. Even after coaching ends, the power imbalance established during the relationship can persist."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "During a session, a client states, 'I just want to be with him again,' referring to their deceased spouse. What is the coach's first ethical responsibility?",

                "Immediately call 911/emergency services.",
                "Ignore the comment as it is a common 'grief burst' expression.",
                "Conduct a risk assessment to differentiate between passive ideation and active suicidal intent/plan.",
                "End the session immediately and terminate the contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must be trained to assess risk. While 'longing for the deceased' is common, the coach must ethically determine if there is an active plan or intent to self-harm before deciding on the next steps."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "In marketing a Grief Coaching practice, which of the following statements would be considered UNETHICAL?",
            "options": [
                "'I offer a supportive space to navigate the challenges of loss.'",
                "'My 6-week program is guaranteed to heal your grief and remove all pain.'",
                "'I have a certification in Grief and Loss Coaching from AccrediPro Academy.'",
                "'I work with clients to build resilience after a significant life transition.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guaranteeing a specific outcome or 'healing' is predatory and unethical, as grief is a non-linear process that cannot be 'fixed' on a set timeline."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A coach discovers that a client is neglecting the basic needs of their minor child due to their own profound grief. What is the coach's ethical and legal obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain confidentiality at all costs to protect the coaching relationship.",
                "Wait until the child is physically harmed before taking action.",
                "Follow mandated reporting laws regarding child neglect or endangerment.",
                "Suggest the client hire a nanny so the coach doesn't have to report."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical grief coaching includes understanding mandated reporting requirements. If a minor or vulnerable adult is at risk due to neglect or abuse, confidentiality must be breached to ensure safety."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Professional Neutrality' in the context of the Karpman Drama Triangle?",
            "options": [
                "The coach takes the side of the client against their family members.",
                "The coach acts as the 'Rescuer' to save the client from their pain.",
                "The coach remains an objective partner, avoiding the roles of Victim, Rescuer, or Persecutor.",
                "The coach remains silent and offers no feedback during sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional neutrality involves staying out of the 'Rescuer' role, which fosters dependency. Instead, the coach empowers the client to find their own path through the grief."
