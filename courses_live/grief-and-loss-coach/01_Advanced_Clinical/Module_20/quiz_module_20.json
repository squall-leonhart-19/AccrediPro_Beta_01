            "question": "In psychometric assessment, which coefficient is most commonly used to measure the internal consistency of a grief scale, with a score of 0.80 or higher typically indicating 'good' reliability?",
            "options": [
                "Pearson's r",
                "Cronbach's Alpha",
                "Cohen's Kappa",
                "Spearman's Rho"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cronbach's Alpha measures internal consistency—how closely related a set of items are as a group. In clinical grief assessments, a score of .80 or higher is the standard for high-quality instruments."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG) is unique because it assesses grief across two distinct timeframes. What are these two scales?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate shock vs. Long-term acceptance",
                "Cognitive symptoms vs. Somatic symptoms",
                "Past behavior (at the time of death) vs. Present feelings",
                "Internal yearning vs. External social dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The TRIG consists of Part I, which measures the person's initial emotional response and behavior at the time of the death, and Part II, which measures current feelings and thoughts regarding the deceased."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to the DSM-5-TR, what is the minimum duration of bereavement required before a diagnosis of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) can be considered for an adult?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the ICD-11 allows for a PGD diagnosis after 6 months, the DSM-5-TR requires at least 12 months to pass since the death for adults to ensure the grief response is truly persistent and beyond cultural norms."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The five domains of the PTGI are: New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation of Life. Financial restoration is not a psychometric domain of PTG."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perceived social support (how supported the client 'feels') is a much stronger predictor of health outcomes than structural support (the actual size or frequency of the network)."

            "options": [
                "Children do not experience somatic symptoms of grief",
                "Developmental age significantly impacts the child's concept of the finality of death",

                "Standardized tools do not exist for children under 18"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A child's developmental stage dictates their understanding of death's permanence and universality, requiring age-appropriate tools like the Inventory of Complicated Grief - Revised for Children (ICG-RC)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EMA involves real-time monitoring (e.g., via smartphone apps), which captures feelings as they occur, reducing 'recall bias'—the tendency of clients to misremember or average out their emotions when asked in a weekly session."

                "The score is within the normal range for healthy mourning",
                "The score suggests the client is in the 'Bargaining' phase",
                "The score is above the typical clinical cutoff (usually 25), suggesting high risk for Prolonged Grief Disorder",
                "The score is too low to warrant any intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On the ICG, a score above 25 is generally considered the threshold for 'Complicated Grief' or PGD, indicating that the client's symptoms are significantly impairing their daily functioning."
