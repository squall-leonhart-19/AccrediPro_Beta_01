            "question": "Neuroimaging studies have identified that the 'yearning' component of grief is primarily associated with increased activation in which brain region?",
            "options": [
                "The Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) and Nucleus Accumbens",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and Occipital Lobe",

                "The Primary Somatosensory Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the Nucleus Accumbens (reward center) and PCC are activated during yearning, as the brain processes the 'reward' of the loved one's memory while struggling with their absence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5-TR specifies that for adults, the bereaved individual must have experienced the loss at least 12 months prior to a PGD diagnosis (6 months for children/adolescents)."

            "question": "In the context of Polyvagal Theory, a client who presents as 'numb,' 'spaced out,' or 'paralyzed' by grief is likely experiencing which physiological state?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is an evolutionary 'freeze' or 'faint' response characterized by dissociation, numbness, and metabolic conservation when a person is overwhelmed by perceived threat or loss."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with Anxious-Ambivalent attachment often struggle with the 'security' of the bond and are more prone to chronic, high-intensity mourning and difficulty achieving restoration."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
