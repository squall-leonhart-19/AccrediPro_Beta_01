            "question": "In the context of metabolic health, why is white adipose tissue (WAT) now classified as a major endocrine organ rather than just a storage site?",
            "options": [
                "It produces red blood cells during periods of starvation.",
                "It secretes bioactive signaling molecules called adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, which regulate systemic inflammation.",
                "It acts as the primary site for the synthesis of thyroid hormones T3 and T4.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adipose tissue is a complex endocrine organ that secretes adipokines. In obese states, it releases pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-6, contributing to chronic low-grade inflammation."

                "SDMA measures liver enzymes while Creatinine measures kidneys.",
                "SDMA is only affected by the pet's diet the morning of the test.",
                "SDMA can detect a loss of kidney function at 25-40% loss, whereas Creatinine often remains normal until 75% loss.",
                "SDMA is a marker of muscle mass and is not related to kidney function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDMA is a more sensitive biomarker for renal function because it is not influenced by muscle mass (unlike creatinine) and rises much earlier in the disease process, allowing for proactive wellness adjustments."
