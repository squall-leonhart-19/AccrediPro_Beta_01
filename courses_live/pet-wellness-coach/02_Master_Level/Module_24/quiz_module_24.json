            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a well-studied HDAC inhibitor; by inhibiting these enzymes, it allows DNA to remain 'unspooled' and accessible for the transcription of protective, anti-cancer genes."

            "options": [
                "They are cheaper than live bacteria",
                "They provide the beneficial metabolic byproducts (like SCFAs) without the risk of bacterial translocation",
                "They contain higher levels of sugar for energy",
                "They are only used for skin conditions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postbiotics are inanimate microorganisms or their components that confer a health benefit; they are safer for immunocompromised pets because there is no risk of live bacteria entering the bloodstream."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaborative care requires that a coach never advises a client to discontinue veterinary-prescribed medication. Any integration must be coordinated with the attending veterinarian."
