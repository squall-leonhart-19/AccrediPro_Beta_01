            "question": "Research into the 'Indoor Ecosystem' has identified which specific pollutant in household dust as a significant risk factor for feline hyperthyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)",
                "Formaldehyde from pressed wood",
                "Carbon monoxide from gas stoves",
                "Radon gas"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PBDEs are flame retardants used in furniture and electronics that accumulate in house dust. Because cats are fastidious groomers, they ingest high levels of these endocrine disruptors, which research has linked to thyroid dysfunction."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of behavioral wellness, 'contrafreeloading' is a term used to describe which animal behavior?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency to guard resources from other household pets",
                "The preference for resting in high-traffic areas of the home",
                "The phenomenon where animals choose to work for food even when identical food is freely available",
                "The act of mimicking the owner's stress responses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Contrafreeloading is a key concept in enrichment neurobiology; it demonstrates that animals are intrinsically motivated to engage in foraging behaviors to activate the brain's reward systems, even when 'free' food is present."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When performing an advanced pain assessment using the Feline Grimace Scale (FGS), which of the following is NOT one of the five facial action units evaluated?",
            "options": [
                "Ear position",
                "Orbital tightening (eyes)",

                "Tail flicking frequency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Feline Grimace Scale focuses specifically on facial features: ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whisker change, and head position. Tail flicking is a behavioral sign but not part of the FGS action units."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Advanced dental wellness protocols emphasize that Stage 3 and 4 periodontal disease are systemic threats. Which biomarker is often elevated in dogs with chronic oral inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",

                "Thyroxine (T4)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic periodontal disease triggers a systemic inflammatory response, leading to increased levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that can affect the heart, kidneys, and liver."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In integrative weight management, adipose tissue is treated as an active endocrine organ. Which hormone secreted by fat cells is responsible for increasing insulin sensitivity but decreases as a pet becomes more obese?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin is a beneficial adipokine that improves insulin sensitivity. Paradoxically, as fat mass increases, adiponectin levels decrease, contributing to metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "The 'DISHAA' tool is used to assess Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD). What does the 'S' in this acronym represent?",
            "options": [
                "Socialization with other dogs",
                "Sleep-wake cycle changes",

                "Separation anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DISHAA stands for Disorientation, Interactions, Sleep-wake cycle, House-soiling/Learning/Memory, Activity, and Anxiety. Sleep-wake cycle changes (like 'sundowning') are primary indicators of CCD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doberman Pinschers have a very high genetic predisposition to DCM. Proactive wellness protocols for this breed involve early cardiac screening to catch the 'occult' (pre-clinical) phase of the disease."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "During an emergency triage assessment, you observe a pet with 'brick red' mucous membranes and a Capillary Refill Time (CRT) of less than 1 second. What does this most likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Dehydration or anemia",
                "Normal, healthy circulation",

                "Cyanosis or respiratory failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Brick red gums and a very fast CRT (<1 second) indicate a hyperdynamic state, often seen in the early stages of distributive shock, sepsis, or life-threatening heatstroke."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On the 9-point Laflamme scale, each point above the ideal score of 5 represents roughly a 10-15% increase in body fat. An 8/9 is roughly 30-35% overweight, classifying the pet as clinically obese."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which environmental intervention has been shown to be most effective in reducing the concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and allergens in a multi-pet household?",
            "options": [
                "Using scented candles to mask odors",
                "Increasing the frequency of professional grooming",

                "Switching to plastic food bowls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filtration combined with proper ventilation is the gold standard for reducing VOCs, dander, and dust-bound toxins in the indoor ecosystem."
