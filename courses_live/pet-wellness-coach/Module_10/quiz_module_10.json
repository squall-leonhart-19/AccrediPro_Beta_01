            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on Environmental Toxicology, why are felines at a significantly higher risk for toxicity from household PBDEs (flame retardants) compared to humans?",
            "options": [
                "They lack the hepatic enzymes to process synthetic chemicals",
                "Their grooming behavior leads to the ingestion of contaminated household dust",
                "Cats have a higher glomerular filtration rate that traps toxins",
                "Feline skin is more permeable to gaseous pollutants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 highlights that felines ingest high levels of household toxins, specifically PBDEs found in dust, through frequent grooming, leading to higher bioaccumulation and linked endocrine issues like hyperthyroidism."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Behavioral Assessments, which 'red flag' most clearly indicates that a behavior is likely rooted in pathogenesis (pain) rather than primary psychology?",
            "options": [
                "The behavior is only triggered by specific strangers",
                "The behavior has been consistent since the animal reached social maturity",
                "The behavior is episodic, inconsistent, and accompanied by physiological 'stacking'",
                "The animal responds well to traditional operant conditioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 teaches that pain-induced behaviors are often episodic and inconsistent. When a behavior appears 'out of character' or fluctuates without clear environmental triggers, a physical assessment for underlying pain is required."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 defines obesity as a 'Systemic Inflammatory Disease.' What is the primary mechanism by which excess adipose tissue contributes to chronic joint degradation?",
            "options": [
                "Purely through the mechanical load on the articular cartilage",
                "By increasing the production of Vitamin D which calcifies soft tissue",
                "Through the secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha",
                "By reducing the animal's thirst drive, leading to synovial dehydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ. It secretes adipokines (cytokines) such as Interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, which create a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that actively degrades joint tissues."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When applying Integrative Mobility support (Lesson 4), what is the significance of the 'Myofascial Lines' in a canine athlete?",
            "options": [
                "They are irrelevant to movement and only provide structural padding",
                "They represent continuous tracks of connective tissue that transmit force and stability across multiple joints",
                "They are the primary sites for subcutaneous fat storage",
                "They dictate the animal's coat color and texture"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myofascial lines are functional continuities of fascia and muscle. Understanding these tracks allows a coach to see how a restriction in the hind limb can manifest as compensatory tension in the neck or forelimbs."

            "options": [
                "The stress of owning a high-energy puppy",
                "The psychosocial distress experienced by family members caring for a chronically ill human relative",
                "The financial strain of professional grooming services",
                "The temporary anxiety of a lost pet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 explores the 'Caregiver Burden,' noting that owners of pets with chronic or terminal illnesses experience similar levels of depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life as human pediatric or geriatric caregivers."

            "question": "When synthesizing the P.A.W.S. Method™ in Lesson 6, what is the purpose of the 'Tiered Implementation' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To charge the client more for different levels of service",
                "To prevent client overwhelm and increase compliance by introducing changes in manageable phases",
                "To test which interventions work before giving the real advice",
                "To satisfy legal requirements for pet insurance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The P.A.W.S. Method™ emphasizes that giving a client 20 changes at once leads to failure. Tiered implementation prioritizes the most impactful changes first (e.g., diet) before moving to secondary supports (e.g., advanced supplements)."

                "Asking open-ended questions to evoke the client's own motivations for change",
                "Providing a 50-page manual at the first session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication that uses open-ended questions, affirmations, and reflections to help clients find their own 'why' for making wellness changes."

            "options": [
                "A coach can diagnose as long as they don't prescribe medication",
                "A coach may suggest a diagnosis if they have seen it many times before",
                "A coach must never provide a medical diagnosis and must refer to a veterinarian for any clinical symptoms",
                "A coach can diagnose skin conditions but not internal diseases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice dictates that Wellness Coaches are not veterinarians. They do not diagnose, treat, or prescribe. Their role is to support wellness and refer to clinical professionals for any suspected pathology."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Lesson 3 cites a landmark study on canine obesity. What was the specific outcome for dogs with osteoarthritis who achieved a weight loss of just 6% to 9%?",
            "options": [
                "There was no measurable change in mobility",
                "A significant decrease in lameness and an increase in kinetic weight-bearing was observed",
                "The dogs required more medication to manage the weight loss stress",
                "The dogs' metabolic rate slowed down permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that even modest weight loss (as low as 6.1%) results in a statistically significant improvement in lameness and objective gait analysis in dogs with osteoarthritis."
