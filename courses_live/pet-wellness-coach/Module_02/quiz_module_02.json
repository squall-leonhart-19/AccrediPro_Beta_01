            "question": "When assessing a canine client using the 9-point Body Condition Score (BCS) scale, a score of 7/9 is best described by which physical markers?",
            "options": [
                "Ribs easily palpable with minimal pressure and a clear hourglass waist.",
                "Ribs palpable with slight excess fat cover, tucked abdomen, and a discernible waist.",
                "Ribs difficult to palpate under a heavy fat cover, with a rounded abdomen and no visible waist.",
                "Ribs not palpable under thick fat, with prominent fat deposits over the lumbar area and base of tail."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A BCS of 7/9 (Overweight) is characterized by ribs that are difficult to palpate due to heavy fat cover, a rounding of the abdomen (loss of tuck), and a waist that is absent or barely discernible from above."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "During a Muscle Condition Score (MCS) evaluation, you notice significant bony prominence over the scapulae and temporal bones, though the pet's BCS is 5/9. What does this likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The pet is at an ideal weight and has excellent muscle tone.",
                "Sarcopenia or muscle wasting, which can occur even in pets with adequate fat stores.",
                "The pet is dehydrated, causing the skin to cling more tightly to the bone.",
                "Normal age-related changes that do not require nutritional intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle Condition Score is distinct from BCS. A pet can be an ideal weight or even overweight (BCS 5-9) while suffering from muscle wasting (sarcopenia) due to illness, protein deficiency, or lack of appropriate exercise."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A Capillary Refill Time (CRT) of 3.5 seconds in a resting feline client is considered:",
            "options": [
                "Normal, indicating excellent peripheral circulation.",
                "Slightly elevated, but typical for older cats.",
                "Abnormal, suggesting poor perfusion, dehydration, or potential shock.",
                "Inconclusive without a concurrent rectal temperature reading."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normal CRT for dogs and cats is under 2 seconds. A CRT of 3.5 seconds is a significant delay, indicating poor blood flow to the tissues, which is often a sign of dehydration or cardiovascular compromise."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the FAS (Fear, Anxiety, Stress) scale used during behavioral evaluations, a pet exhibiting 'whale eye,' lip licking, and a lowered head but still accepting high-value treats is most likely at which level?",
            "options": [
                "FAS 0-1 (Relaxed to Mild)",
                "FAS 2-3 (Moderate Stress)",

                "FAS 5 (Severe Stress/Aggression)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FAS 2-3 describes moderate stress where the pet shows physiological signs of anxiety (lip licking, whale eye) but is still 'operant' and able to be distracted or motivated by food."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "During an Environmental Audit, you identify 'Micro-Slipping' on hardwood floors. According to mobility data, this is a significant stressor for which specific condition?",

                "Separation Anxiety",
                "Chronic Kidney Disease",

                "Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-slipping causes constant micro-trauma to joints and forces compensatory muscle tension to maintain stability, significantly exacerbating the pain and progression of Osteoarthritis."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When performing a mobility assessment, 'bunny hopping' (using both hind legs simultaneously) while running is a classic compensatory sign often associated with:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bunny hopping is a common gait abnormality in dogs with hip dysplasia, as it allows them to propel themselves forward while minimizing the painful range of motion in individual hip joints."

            "options": [
                "Walking speed and weight history.",
                "Water intake, waste (elimination) patterns, and vital signs.",
                "Work-life balance of the owner and weekend activity levels.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'W' in P.A.W.S. stands for Wellness, which encompasses internal health markers including hydration (Water), digestive/urinary health (Waste), and physiological baselines (Vital signs)."

            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the course found that what percentage of pet owners failed to recognize early signs of mobility decline, such as hesitating before stairs?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 45%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The course highlights that roughly 72% of owners overlook subtle mobility changes, often attributing them to 'just slowing down' due to age rather than manageable pain."

            "question": "When evaluating nutritional intake, the 'Digestive Health' assessment focuses on the Bristol Stool Scale. What is the 'Gold Standard' score for a healthy pet?",
            "options": [
                "Score 1: Hard, dry pellets.",
                "Score 2: Firm, segmented, but leaves no residue.",
                "Score 4: Moist, soggy, but holds its shape.",
                "Score 7: Watery, no solid pieces."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Score of 2 (on a 1-7 scale) or the equivalent 'Firm but not hard' is the ideal, indicating optimal fiber intake and nutrient absorption with minimal waste residue."

            "options": [
                "To diagnose specific medical conditions that require prescription medication.",
                "To compare the pet's health to national averages for that breed.",
                "To identify the pet's unique 'normal' so that subtle deviations can be caught before they become clinical crises.",
                "To provide a legal document that protects the coach from liability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Bio-Individual Baseline is the cornerstone of the 'Assess' phase, allowing the coach to recognize when a pet's unique metrics (heart rate, behavior, gait) shift, signaling a need for intervention."
