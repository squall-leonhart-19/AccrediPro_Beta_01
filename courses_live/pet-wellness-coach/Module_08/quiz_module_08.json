            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarcopenia is the age-associated loss of lean muscle mass and strength in the absence of disease, whereas cachexia is the rapid loss of muscle often seen with cancer, CHF, or CKD."

            "explanation": "Studies (such as Hardie et al.) have demonstrated that up to 90% of cats over 12 years of age have radiographic evidence of degenerative joint disease, though it is often underdiagnosed."

            "question": "A senior dog's Resting Energy Requirement (RER) is calculated at 600 kcal/day. Because senior dogs have a lower metabolic rate and decreased lean mass, what is the recommended Maintenance Energy Requirement (MER) multiplier?",

                "1.8 x RER",
                "1.4 x RER",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senior dogs generally require fewer calories due to decreased activity and metabolic shifts; a multiplier of 0.8 to 1.0 x RER is often used to prevent obesity, unless the pet is underweight."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pain is a significant 'masquerader' of cognitive dysfunction. Restlessness, vocalization, and social withdrawal can all be manifestations of untreated physical discomfort rather than primary neurological decline."
