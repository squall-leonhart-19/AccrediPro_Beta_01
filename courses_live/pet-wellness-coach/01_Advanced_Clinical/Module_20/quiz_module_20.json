            "options": [
                "BCS measures fat coverage, while MCS evaluates lean muscle mass over bony prominences like the spine and scapulae.",
                "MCS is only used for feline patients, while BCS is used for all species.",
                "BCS is a 5-point scale, while MCS is always a 9-point scale.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BCS assesses adipose tissue (fat), whereas MCS specifically evaluates muscle wasting (atrophy), which can occur even in overweight animals (sarcopenic obesity)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The calculation is 70 * (20^0.75). 20 raised to the 0.75 power is approximately 9.46. 70 * 9.46 = 662.2 kcal/day."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FAS Score 4 represents high-level distress where the animal is no longer able to transition to a calm state easily and often refuses food rewards due to sympathetic nervous system dominance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "P.A.W.S. stands for Physical, Atmospheric, Wellness, and Social. Atmospheric factors include sensory inputs like high-frequency sounds or pheromone levels."

            "options": [
                "Moves downward to shift weight forward.",
                "Moves upward to shift weight off the painful limb.",

                "Remains perfectly level while the pelvis tilts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'down on the sound' rule applies: the head drops when the sound (healthy) limb hits the ground and rises when the painful limb hits the ground to reduce force."

            "id": "q20_6",

            "options": [
                "SDMA only increases when 75% of kidney function is lost.",
                "SDMA is affected by muscle mass, making it more accurate in athletic dogs.",
                "SDMA can detect a decline in kidney function at 25-40% loss, whereas Creatinine often stays normal until 75% loss.",
                "SDMA measures liver enzymes, providing a more holistic view of filtration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDMA is a biomarker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that identifies renal decline much earlier than traditional creatinine markers and is not influenced by lean body mass."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV indicates a flexible, resilient autonomic nervous system. A drop in HRV suggests the sympathetic nervous system is dominant, often due to stress, pain, or illness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neonates and pediatric patients have significantly higher resting heart rates than adults. Permanent teeth don't erupt until 3-4 months, and renal concentration ability is limited in young kittens."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased nighttime activity (pacing, shifting positions) is a hallmark 'red flag' for orthopedic pain (inability to get comfortable) or the start of cognitive decline (sleep-wake cycle shift)."
