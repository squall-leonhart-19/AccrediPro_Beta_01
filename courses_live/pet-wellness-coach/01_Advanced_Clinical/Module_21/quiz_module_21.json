            "question": "According to the 'Hierarchy of Intervention' in Lesson 1, which phase must be stabilized before a Wellness Coach introduces high-intensity physical conditioning or advanced performance goals?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolic and Physiological Stabilization",
                "Cognitive Enrichment and Socialization",
                "Peak Performance Optimization",
                "Owner Compliance Training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic and physiological stabilization (addressing pain, inflammation, and basic nutritional needs) is the foundation of the wellness roadmap. Introducing high-intensity work before this stage increases the risk of injury and systemic stress."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When setting SMART goals for a weight management plan, why is 'Morphometric Girth Measurement' considered superior to 'Total Body Weight' alone?",
            "options": [
                "It is easier for owners to measure accurately at home.",
                "Total weight does not distinguish between adipose tissue loss and lean muscle mass wasting.",
                "Girth measurements are the only way to calculate a pet's Body Condition Score (BCS).",
                "Weight is a subjective metric while girth is an objective metric."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total body weight is a 'crude' metric. Morphometric measurements (like girth at the 6th rib or limb circumference) help coaches track changes in body composition, ensuring the pet is losing fat rather than vital muscle mass."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3's discussion on Advanced Nutritional Protocols, what is the clinically recommended therapeutic dosage range for combined EPA and DHA in dogs suffering from chronic inflammatory joint disease?",
            "options": [
                "10-25 mg/kg of body weight",
                "40-60 mg/kg of body weight",
                "100-150 mg/kg of body weight",
                "300-500 mg/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic levels of Omega-3 fatty acids for inflammation are significantly higher than maintenance doses, with research suggesting 100-150 mg/kg of body weight for optimal prostaglandin modulation."

        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When sequencing integrative modalities (Lesson 4), why should pain management (e.g., laser therapy or PEMF) generally precede behavioral modification sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Pain management is more expensive and should be done first.",
                "Pain is a significant inhibitor of learning and can increase aggression or fear responses.",
                "Behavioral modification is not effective in senior pets.",
                "Veterinary regulations require pain meds before any training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic pain causes cognitive interference and lowers the threshold for reactive behaviors. By addressing nociception first, the pet is more physiologically capable of engaging in and retaining new behavioral training."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 5 indicates that environmental enrichment can lead to neuroplasticity. Which specific enrichment category has been shown to most effectively lower cortisol levels in high-stress environments?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity predatory play",
                "Novel toy rotation every 2 hours",
                "Auditory stimulation (e.g., specific frequency bioacoustics/classical music)",
                "Increased caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Controlled auditory stimulation has been proven in multiple studies to reduce heart rate variability and lower salivary cortisol levels, making it a primary tool for cognitive enrichment planning."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights that owner non-compliance rates in veterinary medicine can reach 40-60%. Which strategy is most effective for increasing adherence to a complex wellness plan?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a 50-page manual of all possible interventions.",
                "Using 'Motivational Interviewing' to align the plan with the owner's daily lifestyle and values.",
                "Strictly reprimanding the owner when they miss a dose or session.",
                "Delegating all tasks to the owner without a follow-up schedule."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational Interviewing and owner-centric planning ensure the roadmap is realistic. If a plan doesn't fit the owner's schedule or emotional capacity, compliance will inevitably fail regardless of the plan's scientific merit."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "During a re-assessment (Lesson 7), you notice a canine client's Resting Respiratory Rate (RRR) has trended from 15 to 26 breaths per minute. What is the appropriate titration response?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the duration of aerobic exercise.",
                "Immediate suspension of the wellness plan and referral to a veterinarian for cardiovascular screening.",
                "Switch the pet to a high-protein diet.",
                "Wait 14 days to see if the rate returns to normal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An upward trend in RRR (especially approaching or exceeding 30 bpm) is a clinical 'red flag' for potential heart failure or pulmonary distress, requiring immediate veterinary intervention before continuing any wellness activities."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In the SOAP format of professional documentation (Lesson 8), where should a coach record the specific Body Condition Score (BCS) and muscle mass palpation findings?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Objective' section is reserved for measurable, observable data collected by the professional, such as weight, BCS, heart rate, or morphometric measurements."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Bella' is a 9-year-old feline on a weight loss plan. After 4 weeks, she has lost 5% of her body weight, but her owner reports she is now lethargic and hiding. How should the plan be titrated?",
            "options": [
                "Further reduce calories to speed up the process.",
                "Increase calories slightly and re-evaluate for hepatic lipidosis risks with a veterinarian.",
                "Ignore the behavior as it is a normal part of dieting.",
                "Switch to an 'all-access' free-feeding schedule."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid weight loss or lethargy in cats can trigger hepatic lipidosis. A sudden change in behavior (hiding/lethargy) during a nutritional intervention requires a caloric upward titration and veterinary consultation."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'Plan Titration' in the context of an Advanced Wellness Roadmap?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the owner pays for more sessions.",
                "To keep the plan identical for the duration of the pet's life.",
                "To make incremental adjustments based on the pet's physiological response to interventions.",
                "To transition the pet from natural food to synthetic supplements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of refining the intervention (increasing, decreasing, or changing) based on objective data and the pet's specific rate of progress, ensuring the plan remains safe and effective."
