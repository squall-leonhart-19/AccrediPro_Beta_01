        {
            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "Regarding the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), what percentage of the vagus nerve fibers are afferent (sensory), carrying information from the gut to the brain?",
            "options": ["20-30%", "50%", "80-90%", "Over 98%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 80-90% of the vagus nerve fibers are afferent, meaning the 'gut-to-brain' communication is significantly more robust than the 'brain-to-gut' signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is primarily responsible for providing energy to colonocytes and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier?",
            "options": ["Acetate", "Propionate", "Butyrate", "Valerate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred energy source for colon cells and is essential for maintaining the tight junctions that prevent 'leaky gut' or intestinal permeability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to the ISAPP definition explored in Lesson 3, what characterizes a 'Postbiotic'?",
            "options": ["Live microorganisms that confer a health benefit", "Non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial bacteria", "A preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit", "The fermented substrate left over after digestion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postbiotics are inanimate (dead) microorganisms or their cellular components/metabolites that provide a health benefit to the host, offering a more stable alternative to live probiotics."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In managing systemic inflammation, what is the clinically recommended target ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids for dogs with chronic inflammatory conditions?",
            "options": ["Between 2:1 and 5:1", "Exactly 1:1", "Between 10:1 and 15:1", "Omega-6 should be completely eliminated"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While standard commercial diets often exceed 20:1, a therapeutic range of 2:1 to 5:1 is recommended to shift the eicosanoid production toward anti-inflammatory pathways."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Why is adipose tissue considered an 'endocrine organ' in the context of metabolic health?",
            "options": ["It stores excess calories as triglycerides", "It secretes bioactive signaling molecules called adipokines, such as Leptin and Adiponectin", "It regulates body temperature via brown fat thermogenesis", "It acts as a mechanical cushion for internal organs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adipose tissue is not just storage; it is a complex endocrine organ that secretes adipokines which influence systemic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and appetite."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the Phase II Hepatic Detoxification pathway, which process involves the conjugation of toxins with a tripeptide to make them water-soluble for excretion?",
            "options": ["Acetylation", "Glutathione conjugation", "Methylation", "Sulfation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutathione conjugation is a critical Phase II pathway where glutathione (a tripeptide) binds to reactive intermediates from Phase I to render them non-toxic and water-soluble."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Which nutritional intervention has been shown to provide an 'alternative fuel' for the aging brain, specifically helping to mitigate symptoms of Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD)?",
            "options": ["High-protein diets (>35% DM)", "Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs)", "Increased dietary sodium", "Water-soluble Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MCTs are converted by the liver into ketones, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and provide energy to neurons that may have impaired glucose metabolism in senior pets."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "When applying the P.A.W.S. Method™, which specific action falls under the 'A' (Ancestral Alignment) pillar for a pet with chronic GI distress?",
            "options": ["Testing the home's water quality for heavy metals", "Evaluating if the current macronutrient profile matches the species-appropriate biological requirement", "Checking the pet's stress levels during thunderstorms", "Recommending a specific brand of orthopedic bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ancestral Alignment (A) focuses on biological appropriateness, ensuring the diet matches the evolutionary needs of the species to reduce metabolic and digestive stress."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course found that pets with a BCS of 8/9 had significantly lower levels of which anti-inflammatory adipokine?",
            "options": ["Leptin", "Insulin", "Adiponectin", "Cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing hormone; its levels inversely correlate with body fat percentage, meaning obese pets are often deficient in this protective molecule."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A client's dog has been diagnosed with 'leaky gut' and systemic inflammation. Which combination of interventions best addresses the 'Gut-Brain Axis' according to Module 9?",
            "options": ["Strict calorie restriction and increased aerobic exercise only", "Probiotics, Glutamine for mucosal support, and Omega-3 fatty acids", "Antibiotics to clear the microbiome and a high-fiber kibble", "Sedatives to calm the brain and a low-protein diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This combination addresses the microbiome (probiotics), the physical gut barrier (glutamine), and the systemic inflammatory response (Omega-3s), supporting the entire gut-brain axis."
