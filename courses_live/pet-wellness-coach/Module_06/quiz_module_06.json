            "question": "In the context of Advanced Nutritional Bioavailability, how does the Maillard reaction during high-heat kibble processing specifically affect protein quality?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the bioavailability of Lysine by 15% through caramelization.",
                "It creates cross-links between amino acids and reducing sugars, rendering Lysine biologically unavailable.",
                "It enhances the absorption of taurine by stabilizing the protein matrix.",
                "It has no measurable effect on amino acid profiles but improves palatability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Maillard reaction occurs when heat causes a chemical reaction between amino acids (especially Lysine) and reducing sugars, creating compounds that the body cannot digest or utilize, effectively lowering the protein's biological value."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification is the conjugation phase where the liver attaches a polar molecule (like glutathione, sulfate, or glycine) to a toxin to ensure it can be excreted via urine or bile."

                "It serves strictly as a passive storage site for excess triglycerides.",
                "It secretes bioactive signaling molecules called adipokines, such as Leptin and Adiponectin, which regulate systemic inflammation.",
                "It converts Vitamin D into its active form, Calcitriol, more efficiently than the kidneys.",
                "It is the primary site for the production of cortisol during chronic stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adipose tissue is metabolically active, secreting adipokines that influence insulin sensitivity, immune function, and the inflammatory response."

                "They directly dissolve amyloid-beta plaques within the hippocampus.",
                "They act as a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging brains often suffer from glucose hypometabolism; MCTs are converted into ketones in the liver, providing an efficient alternative fuel source for neurons."

            "question": "Undenatured Type II Collagen (UC-II) differs from Glucosamine/Chondroitin because it works through 'Oral Tolerance.' What does this mean for joint health?",
            "options": [
                "It provides the raw building blocks for synovial fluid production.",
                "It must be taken in high gram-level doses to be effective.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "UC-II works via an immune-mediated process called oral tolerance, where small doses signal the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) to reduce the T-cell attack on endogenous joint collagen."
