            "question": "In the 'Empowerment Shift' (Lesson 1), what is the primary distinction between 'Power-Over' and 'Power-With' dynamics?",
            "options": [
                "Power-Over focuses on the parent's needs, while Power-With focuses only on the child's desires.",
                "Power-Over relies on external control and compliance, while Power-With emphasizes collaboration and shared agency.",
                "Power-Over is used for toddlers, while Power-With is reserved for teenagers.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are different terms for the same authoritative style."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The shift to empowerment requires moving from traditional 'Power-Over' models (compliance/control) to 'Power-With' models that foster collaboration and respect the child's agency."

            "question": "According to Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) discussed in Lesson 2, where does the most effective 'scaffolding' occur?",
            "options": [
                "In the area where the child can already perform tasks with 100% mastery.",
                "In the area where the task is so difficult the child cannot succeed even with help.",
                "In the 'sweet spot' between what a child can do independently and what they can do with guidance.",
                "Only during formal educational instruction provided by a certified teacher."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is most effective in the ZPD—the gap between current independent ability and potential ability with adult support."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 explains that self-regulation is a 'bottom-up' process. What does this imply for a parent's intervention during a child's meltdown?",
            "options": [
                "The parent should immediately use logic and reasoning to explain why the behavior is wrong.",
                "The parent must first focus on 'co-regulation' to soothe the nervous system before the child can access higher-order thinking.",
                "The parent should ignore the behavior until the child 'learns' to calm themselves down independently.",
                "The child should be placed in a time-out to reflect on their choices."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because self-regulation develops from the bottom-up (brainstem to prefrontal cortex), a child in distress requires co-regulation to stabilize their nervous system before they can engage in logical problem-solving."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Growth Mindset (Dweck) emphasizes praising the process and effort ('process praise') rather than fixed abilities, which builds resilience and a willingness to tackle harder tasks."

                "It tricks the child into doing what the parent wants without them knowing.",
                "It provides a sense of autonomy and agency while maintaining safe boundaries set by the parent.",
                "It prevents the child from ever having to make difficult decisions later in life.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limited choices provide the 'scaffold' for decision-making, offering the child a sense of agency and control within a safe, parentally-defined framework."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that children who contributed to the household (chores) developed a 'work ethic' and 'community mindset' that strongly predicted professional success and well-being later in life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
