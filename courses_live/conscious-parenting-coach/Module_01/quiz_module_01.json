            "question": "In the neurobiology of reactivity, what occurs during an 'Amygdala Hijack' that prevents a conscious response?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) increases executive function to manage the stressor.",
                "The amygdala triggers a flood of oxytocin to promote immediate bonding.",
                "The amygdala bypasses the Prefrontal Cortex, triggering an immediate sympathetic nervous system 'fight-flight' response.",
                "The parasympathetic nervous system takes over, leading to a state of 'freeze' in all cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An amygdala hijack occurs when the emotional center of the brain perceives a threat and bypasses the rational Prefrontal Cortex, leading to an automatic, reactive survival response rather than a conscious choice."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Ghosts in the Nursery' concept (Fraiberg et al., 1975), why do parents often react disproportionately to specific child behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "Because the child is intentionally manipulating the parent's known weaknesses.",
                "Because the behavior triggers unresolved emotional memories or 'ghosts' from the parent's own childhood upbringing.",
                "Because the parent has a genetic predisposition to high cortisol production.",
                "Because the parent lacks sufficient disciplinary tools to manage the specific age group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intergenerational patterns often manifest as 'ghosts'—unprocessed trauma or unmet needs from the parent's childhood that resurface when their own child exhibits similar behaviors."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s '90-Second Rule' suggests that the chemical process of an emotion lasts approximately 90 seconds. What is the primary goal of 'The Pause' during this window?",
            "options": [
                "To wait for the child to realize they are wrong and apologize.",
                "To allow the initial surge of stress hormones (like cortisol) to flush through the system before acting.",
                "To come up with a logical punishment that fits the crime.",
                "To ensure the child feels the 'cold shoulder' as a form of non-verbal discipline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 90-second rule posits that the physiological lifespan of an emotion is brief; by pausing, we allow the chemical surge to dissipate, preventing us from acting solely on reactive impulses."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Based on Polyvagal Theory, which state must a parent be in to facilitate 'Social Engagement' and co-regulation with their child?",
            "options": [
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Withdrawal)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)",
                "Ventral Vagal (Safe/Social)",
                "Hypo-arousal (Numbing)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the nervous system. A parent must be in this state to offer the facial expressions and vocal prosody required for a child to feel safe enough to regulate."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Research into interoception shows that a significant percentage of neural signals travel from the body to the brain. What is the approximate ratio of afferent (upward) to efferent (downward) fibers in the Vagus nerve?",
            "options": [
                "20% body-to-brain; 80% brain-to-body",
                "50% body-to-brain; 50% brain-to-body",
                "80% body-to-brain; 20% brain-to-body",
                "95% body-to-brain; 5% brain-to-body"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 80% of Vagus nerve fibers are afferent, meaning they carry information from the body's organs to the brain. This highlights why somatic awareness is critical for regulation."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When applying 'Connection Before Correction,' what is the primary neurological reason for prioritizing the relationship in a moment of conflict?",
            "options": [
                "Children are more likely to be afraid of a parent they are connected to.",
                "The child's brain cannot access the 'learning' centers (PFC) until they feel safe and connected.",
                "It allows the parent to avoid having to set any boundaries or consequences.",
                "It builds a sense of 'false security' that makes future discipline easier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurologically, the brain prioritizes survival. If a child feels disconnected or threatened, their Prefrontal Cortex (responsible for logic and learning) stays offline, making 'correction' ineffective until safety is restored."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A parent reframes a child's 'attention-seeking' behavior as 'connection-seeking.' This is an example of which cognitive shift?",

                "The Rupture-Repair Cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing involves looking past the surface behavior (the deed) to identify the underlying emotional or physiological deficit (the need)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the 'Repair Process,' what is considered the most important element for maintaining a secure attachment after a parental outburst?",
            "options": [
                "Waiting at least 24 hours so the child forgets the incident.",
                "Buying the child a gift to compensate for the anger.",
                "Taking full responsibility for the reaction without blaming the child's behavior as the cause.",
                "Explaining to the child that if they hadn't misbehaved, the parent wouldn't have yelled."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective repair requires the parent to own their emotional regulation failure. Blaming the child ('I yelled because you...') invalidates the repair and places the burden of the parent's emotions on the child."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which de-escalation strategy utilizes 'Mirror Neurons' to help a dysregulated child?",
            "options": [
                "Matching the child's high volume to show you are 'serious.'",
                "Maintaining a calm, grounded presence and regulated breathing to 'invite' the child's nervous system to match yours.",
                "Leaving the room immediately so the child has no one to mirror.",
                "Using complex logical arguments to explain why the child should be calm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow humans to 'catch' the emotional state of others. By staying regulated (co-regulation), a parent provides a physiological template for the child’s nervous system to follow."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah finds herself screaming when her 4-year-old spills milk. She realizes this is a 'trigger' linked to her father's harshness regarding cleanliness. What is her first step toward a 'Conscious Response'?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately cleaning the milk to remove the trigger.",
                "Somatic tracking: Noticing the tightness in her chest and heat in her face before she speaks.",
                "Telling the 4-year-old why her behavior was triggering.",
                "Implementing a time-out for the child so Sarah can calm down."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step in moving from reaction to response is somatic awareness—noticing the physical sensations of the trigger in the body. This provides the 'data' needed to initiate 'The Power of the Pause.'"
