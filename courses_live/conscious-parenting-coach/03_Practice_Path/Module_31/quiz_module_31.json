            "question": "In Lesson 1, why is 'Micro-Niche Positioning' considered essential for high-ticket conscious parenting coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to reach a broader, more diverse audience with lower ad spend.",
                "It reduces competition and establishes the coach as a specialist, justifying a premium price point of $3,000+.",
                "It simplifies the coaching process by using a one-size-fits-all curriculum for every client.",
                "It focuses primarily on low-cost lead magnets to build a massive email list of 10,000+ people."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket positioning requires moving from a generalist to a specialist. By narrowing the niche (e.g., 'Conscious Parenting for Neurodivergent High-Achievers'), the coach's perceived authority increases, allowing for premium pricing."

                "Sales: The moment the credit card is processed.",
                "Segmentation: Dividing the audience based on their children's ages.",
                "Selection: The stage where the lead evaluates your specific methodology against alternatives.",
                "Socialization: Encouraging the lead to join a free Facebook community."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selection is the critical middle-to-bottom funnel stage where the prospect determines if your unique methodology (The Conscious Parenting approach) is the right fit for their specific family dynamics."

            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, how does 'Evidence-Based Authority Building' impact conversion rates in the high-ticket sector?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases conversion because scientific data is too boring for most parents.",
                "It has no measurable impact compared to emotional storytelling.",
                "Integrating peer-reviewed citations can increase trust by up to 40% in skeptical, high-intellect demographics.",
                "It is only necessary if the coach does not have a personal success story to share."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For premium coaching, clients are often highly educated and analytical. Providing scientific backing (neurobiology, attachment theory) validates the investment and builds professional credibility."

            "options": [
                "To act as a high-pressure environment to force quick sales decisions.",
                "To foster psychological safety where parents can admit struggles without judgment, facilitating the 'Awareness' stage.",
                "To automate all client interactions using AI chatbots to save the coach time.",
                "To provide a platform for parents to debate different parenting styles aggressively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Organic growth in conscious parenting relies on 'Psychological Safety.' When parents feel safe to be vulnerable, they are more likely to recognize their need for deep coaching work."

                "20x ROAS (earning $20 for every $1 spent)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy high-ticket funnel typically aims for a 3x to 5x ROAS. This allows for the coverage of ad costs, team commissions, and business overhead while maintaining profit."

            "question": "What is the core ethical distinction of 'Conscious Enrollment' compared to traditional high-pressure sales tactics?",
            "options": [
                "Conscious enrollment avoids talking about the price until the very end of the call.",
                "It focuses on 'detachment from the outcome' and ensuring the program is truly in the client's best interest.",
                "It uses 'false scarcity' (e.g., 'only 2 spots left') to encourage parents to sign up faster.",
                "It focuses on the 'pain points' of the parent to make them feel guilty about their current parenting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious Enrollment is trauma-informed. It prioritizes the client's readiness and fit over the sale, practicing detachment and ethical discernment."

                "A general life coach who does not specialize in family dynamics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pediatricians and psychologists are 'Tier 1' because they are already in a position of trust with the target audience and see the 'symptoms' that conscious parenting coaching can help resolve."

            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "A coach transitioning from 1:1 to a 'Hybrid' model (Lesson 8) typically combines which two elements?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,

                "Recognition: People don't know she exists.",
                "Awareness: People don't know they have a problem.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a coach has an audience (Awareness) but no sales, the issue is often 'Selection.' The audience likes the content but doesn't see why Sarah's specific program is the necessary solution to their specific problem."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '7-11-4' rule (7 hours of content, 11 touchpoints, 4 locations) is a common benchmark in high-ticket sales. Over half of cold leads need significant 'nurturing' before committing to a $3k+ investment."
