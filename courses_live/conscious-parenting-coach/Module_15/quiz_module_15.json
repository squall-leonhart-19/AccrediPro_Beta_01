            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of the parent-child dyad (L1), which specific biological mechanism is responsible for 'bio-behavioral synchrony' where heart rates and cortisol levels align?",
            "options": [
                "The activation of the parasympathetic nervous system via the Vagus nerve",
                "The release of oxytocin acting as a neuromodulator across the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis",
                "The rapid firing of the amygdala in response to infant vocalizations",
                "The suppression of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens during stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin acts as a primary neuromodulator that facilitates bio-behavioral synchrony, allowing the parent and child's physiological states to align and buffering the child's HPA axis against stress."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Epigenetics, the 'Meaney and Szyf' studies demonstrated that high-nurturing maternal behavior led to which specific change in the offspring's DNA?",
            "options": [
                "Permanent mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene",
                "Increased DNA methylation of the hippocampal promoter regions",
                "Decreased DNA methylation (demethylation) of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, increasing stress resilience",
                "Shortening of telomeres in the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-nurturing behavior leads to demethylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, which allows for better regulation of cortisol and higher stress resilience throughout the lifespan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3's discussion of Mirror Neurons, why is 'performative calm' (acting calm while feeling internal rage) ineffective for advanced attunement?",
            "options": [
                "Because children lack the cognitive capacity to understand acting",
                "Because mirror neurons detect physiological leakage and micro-expressions, leading to emotional contagion of the underlying state",
                "Because the child's prefrontal cortex is not yet developed enough to process visual cues",
                "Because 'performative calm' increases the parent's cortisol too rapidly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons and the 'human mirror neuron system' (hMNS) detect the incongruence between a parent's outward behavior and their internal physiological state, often causing the child to mirror the hidden distress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "The 'Support vs. Control Paradox' (L4) posits that high-control parenting strategies intended to ensure safety actually result in:",
            "options": [
                "Higher levels of executive function due to strict routine",
                "A decrease in the child's internal locus of control and reduced neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex",
                "Improved long-term resilience through exposure to authority",
                "Faster development of the Vagus nerve's regulatory capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-control parenting inhibits the child's opportunity to practice self-regulation, thereby weakening the development of the prefrontal cortex and shifting their locus of control to external factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "When cultivating Executive Function (L5), a coach should advise a parent to use 'Scaffolding.' What is the primary neurobiological goal of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the amygdala to ensure the child stays alert",
                "To outsource the child's prefrontal cortex functions to the parent indefinitely",
                "To provide the minimum necessary support to allow the child's PFC to build neural pathways for inhibitory control",
                "To increase dopamine levels through constant reward for small tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding allows the child to operate at the edge of their capability, which strengthens the neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex responsible for working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the RAISE Framework (L6), the 'A' stands for Attunement. What is the critical first step of Attunement during a high-arousal crisis?",
            "options": [
                "Explaining to the child why their behavior is unacceptable",
                "Matching the child's energy level with loud vocalizations to show empathy",
                "Physiological self-regulation of the parent to create a 'calm anchor' for the child's nervous system",
                "Offering a reward if the child stops the behavior immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Attunement in a crisis requires the parent to first regulate their own nervous system so they can provide a safe, calm presence that the child's nervous system can co-regulate with."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Somatic Awareness, what is 'Interoceptive Accuracy' and why is it vital for conscious parenting?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to read a child's mind through body language",
                "The ability to sense internal bodily signals (heart rate, tension), which allows parents to catch their own dysregulation early",
                "The speed at which the parent can move physically during a crisis",
                "A measure of how sensitive the parent's skin is to touch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive accuracy allows parents to recognize the 'somatic markers' of their own rising stress (like a racing heart or tight chest) before it leads to a reactive outburst."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 8 found that parents who consistently integrated RAISE principles saw what percentage increase in their child's 'Adaptive Resilience' scores over 12 months?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "24%",
                "42%",
                "65%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that consistent integration of co-regulation frameworks like RAISE correlates with a 42% increase in adaptive resilience measures in children compared to control groups."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Liam (9) is experiencing a 'shutdown' (hypo-arousal) after a school failure. Using the RAISE framework, which intervention is most appropriate for the 'S' (Support) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Giving him space and leaving the room to let him process alone",
                "Low-demand presence and gentle somatic touch (if welcomed) to slowly bring him back into the window of tolerance",
                "Vigorously encouraging him to 'cheer up' and look at the bright side",
                "Setting a firm boundary that he must talk about his feelings within 5 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In hypo-arousal (shutdown), the nervous system needs 'Support' that feels safe and low-pressure to gently re-engage the ventral vagal state without causing further withdrawal."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which brain structure acts as the 'relay station' that the RAISE framework seeks to bypass or soothe during the 'Intervene' phase (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "The Thalamus",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Corpus Callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Intervene phase of RAISE focuses on co-regulation to soothe the Amygdala's 'alarm' response, allowing the brain to shift from survival mode back to the prefrontal cortex."
