            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the nervous system is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System' and is the primary target for effective co-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)",
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC)",
                "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the 'smart' vagus that supports social engagement, facial expressions, and vocal prosody, making it the physiological foundation for co-regulation."

            "question": "In the context of epigenetics and generational trauma, what does DNA methylation represent?",
            "options": [
                "A permanent mutation of the genetic sequence",
                "A chemical 'switch' that can silence or activate genes without changing the DNA sequence",
                "The process of repairing damaged telomeres through positive parenting",
                "A neurological pathway formed only during the third trimester"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation involve chemical tags that influence gene expression (turning them on or off) in response to environmental stressors or trauma, which can then be passed down to offspring."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A child who frequently crashes into furniture and seeks out high-intensity tactile input is likely exhibiting which sensory profile in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Sensory Over-responsivity (Hypersensitivity)",
                "Sensory Under-responsivity (Hyposensitivity/Seeking)",
                "Auditory Processing Disorder",
                "Ventral Vagal Dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory seeking or hyposensitivity occurs when a child's nervous system requires a higher threshold of input to register the sensation, leading them to seek out intense proprioceptive or tactile experiences."

            "id": "q11_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies show that even secure dyads are only 'in sync' about 30-40% of the time. The strength of the attachment comes from the frequency and quality of the repair following a mismatch."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In the Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) framework, what is the primary shift required of the parent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "CPS shifts the focus from 'willful defiance' (compliance) to 'lagging skills,' viewing challenging behavior as a result of a child lacking the cognitive skills to handle specific demands."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "When working with high-conflict co-parents in Lesson 6, which systemic boundary is recommended to protect the child's nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Enmeshed communication via the child",
                "Parallel parenting with low-contact, structured communication",

                "Eliminating all boundaries to encourage 'flow' between households"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-conflict situations, 'Parallel Parenting' (where parents operate independently with minimal contact) is often safer for the child's nervous system than high-conflict 'Co-parenting' attempts."

                "The external manipulation of a client's muscle groups"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Coaches must have high interoceptive awareness to regulate their own nervous system before they can effectively co-regulate a client."

            "id": "q11_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RAISE framework stands for Regulation, Attunement, Integration, Somatic Awareness, and Empowerment. Integration refers to the processing of experiences into a coherent narrative."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Dorsal Shutdown' (collapse/numbness). According to the Polyvagal applications in Lesson 1, what is the most appropriate first step for the coach?",

                "Loud, energetic encouragement to 'wake up' the system",
                "Deep, probing questions about childhood trauma",
                "Gentle, low-demand presence and soft vocal prosody to signal safety",
                "Immediate referral to a psychiatrist for medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a system is in Dorsal Vagal shutdown, high-energy input can be perceived as a threat. The coach must use gentle, low-demand ventral vagal signals to slowly invite the system back toward safety."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "The 2013 study by Dias and Ressler mentioned in Lesson 2 demonstrated that fear responses to specific scents could be inherited by offspring who were never exposed to the scent. This occurred through:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dias and Ressler study showed that ancestral trauma (specifically fear conditioning in mice) was transmitted epigenetically via the germline (sperm), affecting the brain structure and behavior of subsequent generations."
