            "question": "In the context of Conscious Parenting, what is the primary neurobiological difference between 'Compliance' and 'Support'?",
            "options": [
                "Compliance relies on the prefrontal cortex, while Support activates the amygdala.",
                "Compliance often utilizes the threat-response system (extrinsic motivation), whereas Support fosters intrinsic regulation and neural integration.",
                "Compliance increases dopamine levels, while Support focuses exclusively on oxytocin production.",
                "There is no neurobiological difference; they are simply different coaching terms for the same outcome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compliance-based models often rely on fear or reward (extrinsic), which can trigger the threat-response system. Support focuses on co-regulation and building the neural pathways required for internal self-regulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that 15-20% of the population is neurodivergent, necessitating a shift from 'standardized' parenting to a 'neuro-individualized' support model."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Tasks the child can already do independently to build confidence.",
                "Tasks that are far beyond the child's current developmental reach to encourage growth.",

                "Only during times of emotional crisis or 'meltdowns'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ZPD is the area where a child cannot yet succeed alone but can succeed with support. This is where learning and neural development are most active."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Yes Spaces' reduce the frequency of 'No' and 'Don't touch,' which lowers the chronic stress and cortisol levels associated with constant environmental restriction and monitoring."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which Executive Function skill acts as a 'bottleneck' for cognitive load, often leading to 'misbehavior' when a child is overwhelmed by too many instructions?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working memory has a limited capacity. When a child's cognitive load exceeds their working memory capacity, they lose the ability to follow instructions, which is often misinterpreted as defiance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CPS model, popularized by Dr. Ross Greene, posits that challenging behavior occurs when the demands of the environment exceed the child's skills. Support involves identifying those lagging skills."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visual schedules and timers are external scaffolds that support a child's executive function (specifically transition management and time perception) until they can internalize these skills."

            "question": "A 2011 longitudinal study by Moffitt et al. followed 1,000 children for 32 years. What did they find regarding the long-term impact of childhood self-control (supported by executive function)?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Moffitt study is a cornerstone in EF research, showing that supporting the development of self-control in childhood has massive implications for lifelong health, wealth, and public safety."
