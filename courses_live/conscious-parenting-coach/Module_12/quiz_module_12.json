            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of the RAISE framework, what specifically happens to the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) during an 'Amygdala Hijack'?",
            "options": [
                "The PFC increases metabolic activity to compensate for emotional dysregulation.",
                "The PFC becomes functionally 'offline,' inhibiting 'Top-Down' executive control and logical reasoning.",
                "The PFC releases surges of oxytocin to attempt to soothe the limbic system.",
                "The PFC switches from GABA production to glutamate production to increase alertness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During high-stress states, the amygdala triggers a 'Bottom-Up' response that effectively bypasses the PFC, making logical reasoning and impulse control temporarily inaccessible."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Which mechanism is primarily responsible for 'Affective Resonance'—the ability to internally feel a child's emotional state—as discussed in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "The Reticular Activating System (RAS)",
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS)",
                "The HPA Axis",
                "The Cerebellar Vermis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow us to map the actions and emotional states of others onto our own neural representations, creating the 'resonance' necessary for deep attunement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Research by Rachel Yehuda on transgenerational trauma suggests that epigenetic healing involves addressing DNA methylation. What did her studies specifically find in the offspring of trauma survivors?",
            "options": [
                "Increased telomere length compared to control groups.",
                "Higher levels of dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens.",
                "Altered cortisol sensitivity and lower baseline cortisol levels.",
                "A complete absence of the 'warrior gene' (MAOA)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Yehuda's research highlighted that trauma can leave epigenetic markers that affect the HPA axis, often resulting in lower cortisol levels and heightened sensitivity to stress in subsequent generations."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A 7-year-old client (Case Study: 'Leo') frequently bumps into walls, chews on his shirt, and prefers tight hugs. Which sensory system is he likely seeking input for?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular",
                "Interoceptive",
                "Proprioceptive",
                "Olfactory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioceptive input involves the muscles and joints; 'crashing' and seeking deep pressure are classic signs of a child seeking to organize their nervous system through proprioception."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, how is 'Empowerment' distinguished from 'Permissiveness' regarding boundary setting?",
            "options": [
                "Empowerment involves having no rules, whereas permissiveness involves having flexible rules.",
                "Empowerment provides 'Kind and Firm' containment that creates neurological safety, whereas permissiveness lacks the structure needed for the child's nervous system to feel secure.",
                "Empowerment focuses on rewards, while permissiveness focuses on avoiding conflict.",
                "There is no neurological difference; they are two terms for the same approach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious boundaries provide the 'containment' a child needs to feel safe. Permissiveness often leads to anxiety because the child lacks a predictable framework for behavior."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Rupture and Repair' model in Lesson 6, what is the physiological effect of a successful restoration after a conflict?",
            "options": [
                "It spikes adrenaline to ensure the child remembers the lesson.",
                "It down-regulates the sympathetic nervous system and strengthens the Vagus nerve (Vagal Tone).",
                "It increases the production of cortisol to build 'stress resilience.'",
                "It shuts down the Ventral Vagal complex to ensure compliance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Repair is a physiological process. It moves the dyad from a sympathetic (fight/flight) state back into a social engagement state (Ventral Vagal), building resilience through the experience of safety after stress."

            "id": "q12_7",

            "options": [
                "To ensure the adolescent makes zero mistakes before leaving home.",
                "To shift from 'External Regulation' (enforcing rules) to 'Scaffolding Internal Regulation' (facilitating the adolescent's own decision-making process).",
                "To maintain strict control over the adolescent's social media and peer groups.",
                "To stop providing any guidance so the adolescent learns 'the hard way.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Consultant' role focuses on supporting the adolescent's developing Prefrontal Cortex by asking powerful questions and allowing them to practice autonomy within a supportive framework."

            "id": "q12_8",

            "options": [
                "Self-Esteem, Isolation, and Logic.",
                "Self-Kindness, Common Humanity, and Mindfulness.",
                "Discipline, Grit, and Forgiveness.",
                "Awareness, Correction, and Persistence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-kindness (vs self-judgment), Common Humanity (vs isolation), and Mindfulness (vs over-identification) are the three components that prevent burnout and 'compassion fatigue'."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis mentioned in the course (n=4,500) found that sensory-informed environmental design (reducing visual/auditory clutter) resulted in what outcome for neurodivergent children?",
            "options": [
                "A 10% increase in standardized test scores.",
                "A 22% reduction in daily meltdowns and a significant decrease in baseline heart rate.",
                "No measurable change in behavior compared to traditional environments.",
                "An increase in 'stimming' behaviors due to under-stimulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory-informed design reduces the 'allostatic load' on the nervous system, leading to fewer dysregulation episodes (meltdowns) and lower physiological stress."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "In the RAISE framework, the 'Intentional' pillar (Lesson 3) requires a parent to move from 'Reactive' to 'Proactive.' Which coaching tool best facilitates this shift?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Pause and Pivot' technique to create space between stimulus and response.",
                "The 'Consequence Ladder' to ensure immediate punishment for every infraction.",
                "The 'Ignore and Redirect' method to avoid acknowledging negative emotions.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Pause and Pivot' technique is the practical application of the 'Intentional' pillar, allowing the parent to engage the PFC before reacting to a child's behavior."
