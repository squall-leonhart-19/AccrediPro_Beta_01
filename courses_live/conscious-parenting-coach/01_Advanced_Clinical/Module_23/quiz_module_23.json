            "question": "In the RAISE Framework™, specifically during the 'S' (Somatic Awareness) phase, what is the primary objective for the parent?",
            "options": [
                "To intellectually analyze the child's behavior and find a logical solution",
                "To identify and track internal physiological sensations like heart rate or muscle tension without immediate judgment",
                "To immediately verbalize their frustration to the child to ensure transparency",
                "To implement a time-out strategy to de-escalate the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Awareness (S) focuses on 'bottom-up' processing, requiring the parent to notice physical sensations (interoception) to identify their own state of dysregulation before attempting to co-regulate."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to research by Ed Tronick and the 'Still Face' experiments, 'secure' attachment is typically maintained if parents are 'in sync' or attuned to their child what percentage of the time?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-50%",
                "At least 75-80%",
                "100% of the time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 'good enough' parenting involves being attuned 30-50% of the time. The key to secure attachment is not perfection, but the frequency and effectiveness of the repair after a rupture."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model, a 'Firefighter' part in a parent is most likely to react to a child's tantrum by:",
            "options": [
                "Proactively scheduling therapy sessions for the child",
                "Feeling intense guilt and over-analyzing the past",
                "Engaging in impulsive behaviors like screaming or numbing out to 'extinguish' the emotional fire of an Exile part",
                "Setting firm, healthy boundaries using 'Self-Leadership'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Firefighters are reactive parts that step in to distract from or extinguish the pain of 'Exile' parts (vulnerable wounds) through intense, often impulsive reactions."

            "options": [
                "Removing all challenges so the child never experiences frustration",
                "Giving the child tasks that are significantly above their current developmental age to 'stretch' them",
                "Providing the temporary external structure (like visual timers) that allows the child to succeed at a task just beyond their independent reach",
                "Allowing the child to fail repeatedly to build 'grit' without any external support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing the minimum necessary support to help a child bridge the gap between what they can do alone and what they can do with assistance."

            "options": [
                "DNA sequence alterations that are permanent and unchangeable",
                "Consistent 'responsive caregiving' and environmental shifts that alter how genes are expressed",
                "Solely through pharmacological interventions",
                "Ignoring the past entirely and focusing only on the future"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics involves changes in gene expression (like methylation) rather than the DNA sequence itself. Conscious parenting acts as an environmental intervention that can 'turn off' certain stress-response genes."

            "question": "In High-Conflict Co-Parenting, when is 'Parallel Parenting' considered a more effective application of the RAISE Framework™ than 'Co-Parenting'?",
            "options": [
                "When both parents have a high degree of respect and similar parenting styles",
                "When the child is under the age of 2",
                "When direct communication consistently leads to high-conflict 'ruptures' that dysregulate both the parents and the child",
                "Only when one parent has moved to a different state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting limits direct contact between high-conflict parents, allowing each to parent effectively in their own home without the constant 'ruptures' of volatile communication."

            "options": [
                "Asking the child 'Why' they are playing with a specific toy",
                "Correcting the child's behavior if they play with a toy 'incorrectly'",
                "Providing a running commentary of the child's actions (e.g., 'You're putting the blue block on top') to demonstrate presence and attunement",
                "Telling the child a story with a moral lesson while they play"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative tracking is a non-verbal/para-verbal attunement tool that shows the child the parent is fully present and following their lead without trying to control the play."

            "options": [
                "Push through the feeling and ignore it to remain professional",
                "Terminate the session immediately as they are no longer effective",

                "Challenge the client for being boring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is a state of 'shut down.' To be an effective 'container' for the client, the coach must use somatic tools to bring their nervous system back into an active, regulated state."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Mark' finds himself 'scolding' his daughter for her anxiety. He realizes this is a 'Manager' part of himself trying to prevent him from feeling his own childhood helplessness. What is the first step in IFS-informed parenting for Mark?",
            "options": [
                "Apologize to the daughter and tell her she shouldn't be anxious",
                "Identify the 'Manager' part and ask it to 'step back' or 'unblend' so he can lead with 'Self'",

                "Analyze the daughter's neuro-developmental profile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step in IFS is 'unblending.' By asking the protective Manager part to step back, Mark can access 'Self-Leadership' (Calm, Curiosity, Compassion) to deal with his daughter's anxiety."

                "The 'Logic-First' method of explaining why the parent was right to be angry",
                "Wait at least 48 hours before mentioning the incident"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced repair involves 'Being-With' (attunement). It requires the parent to hold space for the child's experience of the rupture before moving into 'Cognitive Reframing' or problem-solving."
