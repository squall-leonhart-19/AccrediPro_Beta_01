            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 focuses on stabilization. Without 'felt safety' and nervous system regulation, higher-level cognitive behavioral changes (Phase 2 and 3) cannot be sustained."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Support' element of Phase 2 involves external resources and systems that sustain the parent, such as community, respite, or childcare support."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of unwanted behavior when a previous reinforcement is removed. Consistency is key to moving through it."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
