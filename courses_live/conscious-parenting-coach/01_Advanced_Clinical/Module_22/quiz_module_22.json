            "question": "A Conscious Parenting Coach is working with a client who begins describing symptoms of clinical depression and past childhood sexual abuse. According to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines (L1), what is the most ethical course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Continue coaching but focus only on the parenting aspects of the client's life.",
                "Use trauma-informed coaching techniques to help the client process the past abuse.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional while clarifying that coaching is not a substitute for therapy.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical coaching requires clear boundaries. When clinical issues like trauma or major depression arise, the coach must refer out to a therapist, as coaching focuses on future-oriented goals rather than the treatment of clinical pathology."

                "The coach should inform both parties at the start that information shared individually may be shared with the other partner if it impacts the coaching goals.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To avoid being triangulated into family secrets, coaches should establish a 'No Secrets' policy during the intake process, ensuring transparency that supports the health of the entire system."

            "explanation": "Mandated reporters are legally required to report when they have 'reasonable suspicion.' They are not investigators and do not need absolute proof before making a report."

                "The coach uses their influence to persuade the parent to adopt the coach's personal values.",
                "The coach facilitates the parent's own inner wisdom, ensuring the client maintains 'Sovereignty' over their family choices."
            ],

                "Because these strategies may ignore the child's sensory needs or neurological profile, potentially causing psychological distress.",
                "Because neurodivergent children are incapable of learning rules or boundaries.",
                "Because the coach should only use strategies that have been around for more than 50 years."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility and neurodiversity awareness require coaches to recognize that 'standard' parenting advice may be harmful or ineffective for children with different neurological needs, such as Autism or ADHD."
