            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The research emphasizes that high reactivity (R) physically inhibits the brain's 'social engagement system,' making attunement (A) nearly impossible until the nervous system is regulated."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High attunement without empowerment leads to 'Rescue' behavior, where the parent feels the child's pain but does not provide the tools for the child to handle it independently."
