            "question": "In the context of Advanced Clinical Supervision (L1), what is the 'Parallel Process' and why is it critical for Master Practitioners to identify?",
            "options": [
                "It is the process of teaching parents to mirror their child's behavior to build empathy.",
                "It occurs when the dynamics between the parent and child are unconsciously replicated in the relationship between the coach and the parent.",
                "It is a scheduling technique where two coaches work with one family simultaneously to ensure objectivity.",
                "It refers to the simultaneous development of the child's prefrontal cortex and the parent's emotional regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parallel Process is a phenomenon where the client-parent dynamic is mirrored in the coach-client relationship. Master Practitioners use self-reflexivity to identify this, ensuring they don't get 'hooked' into the client's dysfunctional patterns."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the Neurobiological Integration of the RAISE Framework™ (L2), which neurological state is required before a parent can move from 'Regulation' to 'Investigation'?",
            "options": [
                "Activation of the Amygdala to ensure the parent is alert to the child's needs.",
                "Suppression of the Vagus nerve to increase heart rate variability.",
                "Sufficient Ventral Vagal tone to bring the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) back 'online'.",
                "A state of 'Freeze' to prevent impulsive physical reactions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The RAISE Framework™ requires physiological regulation (Ventral Vagal state) as a prerequisite for cognitive investigation. If the PFC is offline due to sympathetic arousal, the parent cannot logically investigate the 'why' behind a behavior."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights a 2021 study on somatic processing. When a client is in a state of 'Sympathetic Hyper-arousal,' why is a 'Bottom-Up' approach prioritized over 'Top-Down' talk therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Because talk therapy is too expensive for most high-conflict families.",
                "Because cognitive processing is inhibited when the nervous system perceives a threat; the body must feel safe before the mind can reason.",
                "Because 'Top-Down' approaches are only effective for children under the age of five.",
                "Because the 'Bottom-Up' approach focuses solely on the child's behavior rather than the parent's feelings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up regulation addresses the autonomic nervous system directly. When a parent is hyper-aroused, the 'thinking brain' (top-down) is largely inaccessible, making traditional talk therapy ineffective until somatic safety is established."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "In Transgenerational Synthesis (L4), a 'Genogram' is used to identify 'Ghost Patterns.' What does this term refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Undiagnosed psychological disorders in the family lineage.",
                "The physical resemblance between ancestors and the current child.",
                "Unconscious parenting scripts and emotional traumas passed down through epigenetic and behavioral inheritance.",
                "The tendency of children to ignore their parents' requests."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ghost patterns are the invisible, intergenerational scripts—such as specific ways of handling anger or affection—that parents repeat until they are brought to conscious awareness through synthesis and legacy rewriting."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Mark' and 'Elena' are in a high-conflict co-parenting situation. Mark frequently sends long, accusatory emails. According to Lesson 5, which communication mastery technique should the coach implement?",

                "The RAISE method for children.",
                "The BIFF method (Brief, Informative, Friendly, Firm).",

                "Reflective Listening to validate Mark's accusations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BIFF method is the gold standard for high-conflict co-parenting. It minimizes 'hooks' for further conflict by keeping communication concise, factual, polite, and focused on boundaries."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses the 'Ethics of Influence.' What is the primary difference between 'Power-Over' and 'Power-With' in the coaching relationship?",
            "options": [
                "Power-Over is faster; Power-With takes longer but is more sustainable.",
                "Power-Over relies on the coach's authority and directives; Power-With relies on collaborative empowerment and the client's autonomy.",
                "Power-Over is for crisis intervention; Power-With is for general coaching.",
                "There is no difference; both are necessary for effective behavioral change."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners move away from being the 'expert' who dictates (Power-Over) and instead facilitate a collaborative environment (Power-With) where the parent develops their own internal compass."

            "options": [
                "Only 1% of parents will actually achieve full consciousness.",
                "Parents should only change 1% of their child's diet at a time.",
                "Focusing on 1% improvements daily leads to exponential growth through the compounding effect of neuroplasticity.",
                "Coaches should only give 1% of their advice in the first session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 1% Rule emphasizes small, manageable shifts. In the context of the basal ganglia and habit formation, these small shifts prevent the 'threat response' triggered by massive, overwhelming changes."

            "id": "q24_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery is defined by the shift from doing (practitioner) to being (mentor). It involves modeling the work and empowering clients and other coaches to step into their own leadership within the conscious parenting movement."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that parents using the RAISE Framework™ showed a 42% increase in 'Parental Self-Efficacy.' What was the primary driver of this increase?",
            "options": [
                "Higher income levels in the study group.",
                "The 'Empowerment' phase, where parents shifted from reactive discipline to proactive problem-solving.",

                "Increased frequency of coaching sessions (4x per week)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition from reactivity to proactive, collaborative problem-solving (the 'E' in RAISE) significantly boosts a parent's belief in their own capability to handle challenges."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "When a coach experiences 'Somatic Counter-transference' (feeling a client's anxiety in their own body), what is the first step recommended in Lesson 1?",

                "Prescribe anti-anxiety exercises for the client to do at home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners must use self-reflexivity to 'unblend' from the client's energy. Grounding allows the coach to remain a regulated 'anchor' rather than becoming swept up in the client's somatic dysregulation."
