            "question": "In the RAISE framework, what is the primary neurobiological distinction between a 'Reaction' and a 'Response'?",
            "options": [
                "Reaction is governed by the prefrontal cortex, while response is governed by the limbic system.",
                "Reaction is an automatic amygdala-driven process, while response involves the engagement of the ventral vagal complex and executive function.",
                "Reaction is a conscious choice, while response is a biological reflex.",
                "There is no neurobiological difference; the terms are used interchangeably for coaching clarity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A reaction is a bottom-up survival mechanism (amygdala hijack), whereas a response is a top-down process requiring the 'pause' that engages the prefrontal cortex and the calming influence of the ventral vagal system."

        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Deep Attunement, which system in the brain is responsible for 'emotional resonance,' allowing a parent to feel a child's internal state?",
            "options": [
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Somatosensory Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS) allows the parent to internally simulate the child's actions and emotions, creating the bio-behavioral synchrony required for attunement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights that approximately what percentage of parenting behaviors are 'habit-driven' or automatic, necessitating the practice of Intentionality?",
            "options": [
                "15-20%",
                "30-35%",
                "40-45%",
                "85-90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly 40-45% of daily actions are habitual, which is why the RAISE framework emphasizes intentionality to break intergenerational cycles."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "When applying the 'Support' pillar to neurodivergent children (Lesson 4), what does the 'Low Demand' approach prioritize?",
            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to schedules to provide stability.",
                "Reducing cognitive and sensory load to keep the child within their Window of Tolerance.",
                "Increasing rewards for compliance to build new neural pathways.",
                "Ignoring the behavior until the child self-regulates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Low Demand approach focuses on environmental and task modification to reduce nervous system arousal, ensuring the child stays within their functional Window of Tolerance."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In the 'Empowerment' stage (Lesson 5), what is the specific purpose of 'Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a permanent safety net for the child's mistakes.",
                "To discipline the child through logical consequences.",
                "To provide temporary support that is gradually removed as the child masters a self-regulation skill.",
                "To ensure the parent remains the primary decision-maker in the household."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding is a developmental tool where the parent provides just enough support for the child to succeed, slowly withdrawing that support as the child's autonomy and competence grow."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "During a 'Level 3 Meltdown' (Lesson 6), which action is contraindicated (should be avoided) according to the RAISE Crisis Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring physical safety.",
                "Using 'Co-regulation' techniques like deep breathing nearby.",
                "Attempting to teach a moral lesson or use logic to stop the behavior.",
                "Reducing sensory input (dimming lights, lowering voice)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a meltdown, the child's 'thinking brain' (prefrontal cortex) is offline. Attempting to use logic or teach lessons during this stage is ineffective and often escalates the crisis."

            "id": "q7_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 3-C Reframing technique involves 'Catching' the critical thought, 'Checking' it against reality/values, and 'Changing' it into a self-compassionate, growth-oriented statement."

            "options": [
                "The total number of minutes the child spends in 'Time Out'.",
                "The speed of the parent's 'Repair' after a disconnection.",
                "The child's 100% compliance with household rules.",
                "The absence of all parental anger or frustration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conscious parenting does not seek perfection; it seeks connection. The 'Repair'—how quickly and effectively a parent restores the relationship after a conflict—is the gold standard for tracking growth."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "In a 2023 case study mentioned in the module, parents who implemented 'Attunement Breaks' (Lesson 2) saw what average reduction in cortisol levels over 8 weeks?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module references data showing an average 22% reduction in salivary cortisol (stress hormone) levels in parents who practiced consistent attunement and co-regulation."

                "Allowing the child to make all household decisions for one week.",
                "Providing 'Limited Choices' (e.g., 'Do you want to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?').",

                "Explaining the complex psychological benefits of autonomy to the child."
            ],
