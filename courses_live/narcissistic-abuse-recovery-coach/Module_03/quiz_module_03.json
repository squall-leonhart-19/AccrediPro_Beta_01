            "options": [
                "The survivor's natural conscience and moral compass.",
                "The internalized voice of the abuser that the survivor perceives as their own self-criticism.",
                "A healthy psychological defense mechanism used to prevent future abuse.",
                "The biological urge to return to the narcissistic partner."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The narcissistic introject is the process where the survivor internalizes the abuser's criticisms and projections, eventually mistaking this 'outer voice' for their own internal monologue."

                "Survival values are based on avoiding punishment and seeking the abuser's approval.",
                "Authentic values are easier to maintain in high-stress environments.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Survival values are reactive and externalized, focused on mitigating harm. Recovery requires shifting to intrinsic, authentic values that reflect the survivor's true self."
