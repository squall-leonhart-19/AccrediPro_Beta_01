            "question": "In the Unified N.A.R.C. Framework, why is the recovery process described as 'Iterative' rather than 'Linear'?",
            "options": [
                "Because survivors must repeat the same mistakes to learn from them.",
                "Because recovery involves revisiting earlier stages with higher levels of cognitive and somatic awareness.",
                "Because the framework follows a strict 5-step process that cannot be deviated from.",
                "Because narcissistic abuse is a cyclical phenomenon that never truly ends."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The N.A.R.C. framework views recovery as a spiral; revisiting stages like 'Deconstruction' from a place of higher awareness allows for deeper integration and prevents the 'stuckness' of linear expectations."

            "question": "What is the primary objective of 'Advanced Cognitive Synthesis' when addressing 'Second-Order Gaslighting'?",
            "options": [
                "To prove the abuser's lies were factually incorrect using external evidence.",
                "To ignore the abuser's narrative entirely and focus only on the future.",
                "To deconstruct the 'meta-narrative' (the abuser's story about the survivor's sanity) rather than just individual lies.",
                "To confront the abuser with a list of their cognitive distortions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Second-order gaslighting attacks the survivor's very ability to perceive reality. Advanced synthesis focuses on dismantling the overarching 'meta-narrative' the abuser constructed to pathologize the survivor."

            "question": "According to the Somatic Integration lesson, what is 'Titration' in the context of processing trauma?",
            "options": [
                "The process of experiencing the full weight of trauma all at once to achieve catharsis.",
                "The slow, incremental release of traumatic energy to keep the client within their Window of Tolerance.",

                "A method of physical exercise designed to burn off excess cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is critical in somatic work to prevent re-traumatization. It involves breaking down traumatic memories or sensations into small, manageable 'drops' that the nervous system can process without becoming overwhelmed."

            "id": "q18_4",

            "options": [
                "The development of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) following narcissistic abuse.",
                "A total loss of personality where the survivor has no sense of self.",
                "A split between the 'Pre-Abuse Self' (innocence/trust) and the 'Survivor Self' (vigilance/trauma).",
                "The ability to act like a different person depending on who the survivor is with."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity Bifurcation is the internal sense of being two different people: the person before the trauma and the person defined by the trauma. Synthesis aims to reconcile these into an integrated 'Third Self.'"

                "Reactive Parenting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting is a relational synthesis strategy that allows parents to remain detached from one another while parenting their children, minimizing contact and opportunities for narcissistic manipulation."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "A coach experiences a sudden, intense feeling of 'brain fog' and confusion while a client is describing a gaslighting incident. According to Lesson 6, this is likely an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic Countertransference occurs when a coach physically or mentally 'picks up' the internal state of the survivor (e.g., the confusion of gaslighting) through mirror neurons and projective identification."

                "It determines whether the coach should charge more for the sessions.",
                "It helps the coach decide if the client is 'lying' about their experience.",
                "It dictates whether the intervention should focus on individual healing or navigating broader institutional/familial flying monkeys.",
                "Systemic abuse is easier to heal than primary narcissistic abuse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case conceptualization must account for the environment. If the abuse is systemic (supported by family or institutions), the recovery path must include specialized boundary and exit strategies for the entire system."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is one of the five pillars of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) as defined by Tedeschi & Calhoun (2004)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-Traumatic Growth is not just 'bouncing back' (resilience) but 'bouncing forward.' 'New Possibilities' is a core dimension where the survivor sees new opportunities and life paths that weren't visible before."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that survivors who engage in 'Somatic-Cognitive Bridge' work show what percentage increase in 'Internal Locus of Control' compared to cognitive-only groups?",

                "15%",

                "88%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (often cited in advanced NAR training) indicates that integrating the body (Somatic) with the mind (Cognitive) significantly boosts the survivor's sense of agency (Locus of Control) by roughly 34-40% over talk therapy alone."

                "To physically move the client from one side of the room to the other.",
                "To connect the wisdom gained through suffering with the client's future goals and values.",
                "To bridge the gap between the coach's experience and the client's experience.",
                "To help the survivor reconcile with the narcissist for closure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bridge Technique is a synthesis tool that helps survivors view their 'trauma-informed wisdom' as a foundational asset for their future self, rather than a shameful burden to be discarded."
