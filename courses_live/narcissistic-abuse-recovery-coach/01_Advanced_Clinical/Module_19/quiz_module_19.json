            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Neurobiological research indicates that chronic narcissistic abuse often leads to 'amygdala hijacking.' What physical change is typically observed in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) as a result?",
            "options": [
                "Increased gray matter density and heightened executive function",
                "Significant thinning of the cortical layer and reduced top-down regulation",
                "Increased connectivity between the PFC and the hippocampus",
                "No observable change in the PFC, as damage is localized to the limbic system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that chronic stress from abuse leads to PFC thinning, which impairs the survivor's ability to regulate emotions and make logical decisions (top-down regulation)."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which psychometric tool is most commonly used in clinical research to distinguish between 'Grandiose' and 'Vulnerable' narcissism?",
            "options": [
                "The Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI-40)",
                "The Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI)",
                "The MMPI-2 Restructured Form",
                "The Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the NPI-40 is the gold standard for grandiose narcissism, the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) is specifically designed to capture both grandiose and vulnerable dimensions."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the study of intermittent reinforcement, which schedule of reward produces the most persistent behavior and the strongest resistance to 'extinction' in a trauma bond?",
            "options": [
                "Fixed-ratio schedule",
                "Fixed-interval schedule",
                "Variable-ratio schedule",
                "Continuous reinforcement schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The variable-ratio schedule (unpredictable rewards) creates the strongest biological 'hook' because the brain continues to seek the dopamine spike associated with the 'win' long after the rewards stop."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A 2018 meta-analysis on C-PTSD interventions highlighted that 'Bottom-Up' processing is often more effective for initial stabilization than 'Top-Down' processing. Which is an example of a Bottom-Up modality?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)",
                "Somatic Experiencing (SE)",

                "Narrative Exposure Therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up modalities like Somatic Experiencing focus on the body and the nervous system first, rather than trying to 'think' one's way out of a trauma response."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Epigenetic research (e.g., Meaney et al.) suggests that narcissistic traits can be passed down through 'biological embedding.' What is the primary mechanism identified?",
            "options": [
                "Direct mutation of the DNA sequence in the womb",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NR3C1 gene regulates cortisol receptors; environmental trauma causes methylation of this gene, which alters how the offspring manages stress and empathy."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Cognitive Dissonance Meta-Analysis,' what is the most common psychological strategy survivors use to resolve the conflict between the 'Abuser's Mask' and the 'Abuser's Reality'?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate termination of the relationship",

                "Complete amnesia of the abusive events"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To reduce the pain of dissonance, the brain often chooses to rationalize the abuser's behavior or blame the self, as this provides a (false) sense of control over the situation."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "In the context of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) data, what percentage of trauma survivors typically report at least one domain of positive growth following a crisis?",

                "Nearly 100% of survivors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research by Tedeschi and Calhoun indicates that 50-70% of survivors report some form of PTG, such as increased personal strength or deeper spiritual connection."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Jean Twenge’s research on the 'Narcissism Epidemic' found that NPI scores among American college students rose significantly between 1982 and 2006. What was the approximate increase?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "15%",
                "30%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Twenge's Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis found that average NPI scores rose by approximately 30% over that 24-year period, indicating a societal shift."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol is neurotoxic to the hippocampus, leading to volume loss (atrophy), which explains the memory issues and 'fog' reported by survivors."
