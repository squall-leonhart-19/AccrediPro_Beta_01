            "question": "Which neurobiological mechanism is primarily responsible for the 'addictive' quality of a trauma bond in narcissistic abuse?",
            "options": [
                "The steady release of Serotonin during the 'hoovering' phase",
                "Intermittent reinforcement causing massive Dopamine spikes during reconciliation",
                "The permanent shutdown of the Prefrontal Cortex",
                "A decrease in Oxytocin during the love-bombing phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intermittent reinforcement creates a powerful biochemical hook. When the abuser provides occasional 'crumbs' of affection, the brain releases high levels of dopamine, similar to the mechanism found in gambling addiction."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the ICD-11 criteria for C-PTSD discussed in Lesson 2, which 'Disturbances in Self-Organization' (DSO) symptom distinguishes it from standard PTSD?",
            "options": [
                "Hypervigilance and exaggerated startle response",
                "Flashbacks and nightmares regarding a specific event",
                "Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated, or worthless",
                "Avoidance of external reminders of the trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While PTSD focuses on re-experiencing and hyperarousal, C-PTSD includes DSO symptoms, specifically persistent negative self-concept, emotional dysregulation, and interpersonal difficulties."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'Cognitive Dissonance' because they remember both the 'Prince Charming' and the 'Monster.' What is the primary goal of resolving this dissonance?",
            "options": [
                "To help the client remember only the bad times to fuel anger",
                "To convince the client that the 'Prince Charming' persona was the only true self",
                "To integrate the two conflicting realities into a single, cohesive understanding of the abuser's pathology",
                "To suppress the positive memories using Thought Stopping techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resolution occurs when the survivor accepts that both versions exist but that the 'good' version was a tool used to facilitate the abuse, creating a singular, realistic view of the individual."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 distinguishes between 'Healthy Guilt' and 'Toxic Shame.' Which statement best describes Toxic Shame?",
            "options": [
                "A temporary feeling of regret for a specific behavior",
                "An internal state where the survivor feels they *are* a mistake rather than having *made* a mistake",
                "A social emotion that encourages the survivor to apologize to the abuser",
                "A physiological response to being caught in a lie"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Toxic shame is identity-based; it is the internalization of the abuser's projections, leading the survivor to believe their core essence is flawed or unlovable."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In the context of Somatic Manifestations (Lesson 5), what does the 'Body Keeps the Score' philosophy suggest about chronic pain in survivors?",
            "options": [
                "The pain is purely psychological and requires only 'positive thinking'",
                "The HPA axis becomes dysregulated, leading to chronic inflammation and suppressed immune function",
                "Survivors are usually imagining symptoms to gain sympathy (secondary gain)",
                "Physical symptoms are always the result of direct physical battery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress from narcissistic abuse leads to prolonged cortisol exposure and HPA axis dysregulation, which often manifests as fibromyalgia, autoimmune issues, and chronic fatigue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Why is the grief experienced after narcissistic abuse often categorized as 'Disenfranchised Grief'?",
            "options": [
                "Because the survivor is grieving the loss of a person who is still alive and a relationship that was based on an illusion",
                "Because the survivor is not legally allowed to grieve due to a restraining order",
                "Because the grief only lasts for a very short period (less than 2 weeks)",
                "Because the survivor feels no sadness, only relief"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief is grief that is not socially validated or understood. Survivors grieve the 'idealized' version of the abuser and the future they thought they had, which others may not recognize as a 'real' loss."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Pete Walker describes an 'Emotional Flashback' as a 'sudden and often prolonged regression to the frightening and abandoned feeling-states of childhood.' What is a key characteristic of these flashbacks?",
            "options": [
                "They always involve vivid visual hallucinations of the abuse",
                "They are typically accompanied by a 'superpower' sense of clarity",
                "They occur without a visual component, manifesting instead as intense feelings of dread, shame, or hopelessness",
                "They only happen when the survivor is in the presence of the abuser"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike traditional PTSD flashbacks, emotional flashbacks are purely affective (feeling-based) and do not usually have a visual or auditory component, making them difficult for the survivor to identify."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When 'Healing the Inner Child' (Lesson 8), the coach helps the survivor identify 'Core Wounds.' Which of the following is a common core wound for narcissistic abuse survivors?",
            "options": [
                "The belief that they are 'Too Powerful'",
                "The belief that 'I am only worthy if I am performing or serving others'",
                "The belief that the world is an inherently safe and easy place",
                "A lack of empathy for others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many survivors were 'parentified' or valued only for what they provided to the narcissist, leading to a core wound that their worth is conditional upon their performance or utility."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Brain Fog,' memory gaps, and difficulty making simple decisions. Based on Module 2, this is most likely a result of:",
            "options": [
                "Early-onset dementia",
                "The 'High-Beta' brainwave state and chronic hippocampal shrinkage due to prolonged cortisol exposure",
                "A lack of interest in the recovery process",
                "The 'Narcissistic Halo Effect'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged trauma and high cortisol levels are scientifically linked to shrinkage of the hippocampus (memory center) and an overactive amygdala, resulting in the 'brain fog' and cognitive impairment common in survivors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'A' (Acknowledge) phase in the recovery methodology?",
            "options": [
                "To force the survivor to confront the abuser in person",
                "To validate the survivor's experience and name the specific psychological injuries sustained",
                "To skip over the pain and move immediately to dating again",
                "To diagnose the abuser with a personality disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledge is the first step because healing cannot begin until the survivor understands that their symptoms (C-PTSD, shame, somatic pain) are normal reactions to abnormal levels of stress and manipulation."
