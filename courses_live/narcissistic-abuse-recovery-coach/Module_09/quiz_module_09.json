            "question": "In the neurobiology of Narcissistic Victim Syndrome (NVS), which structural change is most commonly observed in the brain due to chronic cortisol exposure?",
            "options": [
                "Hypertrophy of the Prefrontal Cortex and shrinking of the Amygdala",
                "Thinning of the Prefrontal Cortex and Amygdala enlargement",
                "Increased density in the Hippocampus and thinning of the Cerebellum",
                "Total cessation of activity in the Ventral Tegmental Area"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and cortisol exposure in NVS lead to an enlarged, hyper-reactive Amygdala (fear center) and a thinning of the Prefrontal Cortex (executive function), which impairs the victim's ability to regulate emotions and think logically."

            "question": "According to Jennifer Freyd’s theory of 'Betrayal Blindness,' why does a victim often fail to perceive the abuser's manipulation?",
            "options": [
                "The victim possesses a low IQ and cannot process complex social cues",
                "The victim is choosing to be complicit in the abuse for financial gain",
                "The brain prioritizes maintaining a necessary attachment for survival over the awareness of betrayal",
                "The abuser uses hypnotic suggestions to mask their behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Betrayal Blindness occurs when the victim is dependent on the abuser for survival or social support; the brain 'ignores' the abuse to preserve the attachment bond necessary for the victim's perceived safety."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Which biochemical process is primarily responsible for the 'addictive' quality of a trauma bond?",
            "options": [
                "The consistent, steady release of Serotonin during the devaluation phase",
                "The intermittent reinforcement of Dopamine during the 'hot-and-cold' cycle",
                "The complete depletion of Oxytocin during the love-bombing phase",
                "A decrease in Adrenaline during high-conflict arguments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma bonding is driven by intermittent reinforcement. The unpredictable delivery of 'rewards' (affection) triggers massive Dopamine spikes, creating an addiction-like dependency similar to gambling."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A client describes a scenario where they confronted their partner about infidelity. The partner denied it, attacked the client's character, and then claimed they were the one being 'suffocated.' Which manipulation tactic is this?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DARVO stands for Deny the behavior, Attack the person bringing it up, and Reverse the roles so the abuser becomes the 'victim' and the actual victim is labeled the 'offender.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hoovering is a manipulation tactic named after the vacuum brand, designed to 'suck' the victim back into the relationship when the narcissist fears losing control or needs a source of narcissistic supply."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Echoists are the opposite of narcissists; they often struggle to have a 'voice' and fear that expressing any needs or taking up space will make them appear narcissistic."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
