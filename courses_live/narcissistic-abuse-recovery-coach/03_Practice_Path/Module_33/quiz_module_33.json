            "question": "Which of the following actions represents a breach of the 'Line of Death' regarding a coach's scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a client with a checklist of narcissistic traits for educational purposes.",
                "Formally diagnosing a client's ex-partner with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) in a written report.",

                "Teaching a client emotional regulation techniques like 'Grey Rocking'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As established in Lesson 1, the 'Line of Death' separates coaching from clinical practice. Formally diagnosing anyone (client or third party) is a clinical/medical act that exceeds the coaching scope and creates significant legal liability."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "Under the 'Duty to Warn' principle (Tarasoff v. Regents), what is the coach's legal obligation if a client makes a specific, credible threat of physical violence against an identifiable victim?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain absolute confidentiality to protect the coach-client privilege.",
                "Terminate the coaching relationship immediately without explanation.",
                "Notify the intended victim and/or law enforcement, as the threat of harm supersedes confidentiality.",
                "Wait until the next session to see if the client's intent has changed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlights that 'Duty to Warn' is a critical risk management concept. When a specific threat is made against a third party, the legal and ethical obligation to prevent harm overrides the client's right to confidentiality."

            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "In the context of high-conflict cases, what is the primary function of an 'Indemnity Clause' in a coaching contract?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the coach gets paid even if the client cancels.",
                "To require the client to compensate the coach for any legal fees or losses incurred due to the client's actions or legal disputes.",
                "To guarantee that the client will win their upcoming court case.",
                "To allow the coach to share the client's data with third-party marketers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 explains that indemnity clauses are vital in high-conflict cases. They protect the coach financially if the client's legal situation (e.g., a subpoena from an abusive ex) forces the coach into legal proceedings."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "A 2022 study indicated that 74% of data breaches involved human error. To maintain HIPAA/GDPR compliance, how should a coach handle 'Business Associate Agreements' (BAAs)?",
            "options": [
                "BAAs are only required for medical doctors, not recovery coaches.",
                "A BAA must be signed with any software provider (like Zoom or Dropbox) that handles the client's Protected Health Information (PHI).",
                "BAAs are verbal agreements that do not need to be in writing.",
                "BAAs are only necessary if the coach has more than 50 clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 emphasizes that for US-based coaches, HIPAA requires a written BAA with any vendor that stores or transmits PHI to ensure they meet security standards."

            "options": [
                "They can provide expert opinions on the 'Narcissistic Rage' of the defendant.",
                "They can only testify to facts they directly observed or heard during sessions, without offering professional opinions.",
                "They are legally required to lie to protect the client's interests.",
                "They can ignore the subpoena as coaching is always privileged communication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 distinguishes between Fact and Expert witnesses. Coaches usually testify as Fact Witnesses, meaning they describe what happened (e.g., 'The client attended 10 sessions') rather than providing clinical interpretations or expert opinions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 details that Professional Liability (E&O) insurance is the cornerstone of a coach's risk architecture, covering claims related to the specific services and advice provided."

                "'Read these testimonials from former clients about their experience.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 warns against 'guaranteed' outcomes and clinical claims. Promising a 'cure' for a clinical condition like C-PTSD violates FTC regulations and exceeds the coaching scope of practice."

            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "When practicing cross-border (e.g., a US coach with a UK client), what does the GDPR's 'Right to Erasure' (Right to be Forgotten) mean for the coach?",

                "The coach must charge a fee if the client wants their data deleted."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 covers international compliance. The GDPR 'Right to Erasure' allows clients to request data deletion, which the coach must honor unless there is a superseding legal reason (like tax laws or statute of limitations) to keep it."

        {
            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "In a high-conflict contract, a 'Dispute Resolution' clause typically requires that any disagreements between coach and client be settled through:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 explains that Dispute Resolution clauses are used to keep disagreements out of public courtrooms, favoring private mediation or arbitration to protect both parties' privacy and reduce costs."

            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "If a coach receives a subpoena for client records, what should be their first step according to the protocol in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately mail the records to the requesting attorney.",
                "Delete the records so they don't have to be shared.",

                "Ignore the subpoena until a second notice is sent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 emphasizes that a subpoena is not an automatic 'open door.' The coach must first notify the client (unless legally barred) and seek legal advice to protect client confidentiality and determine the subpoena's validity."
