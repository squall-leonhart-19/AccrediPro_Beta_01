            "id": "q30_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 189, 'Identity Erosion' is described as a primary side effect of narcissistic abuse. What is the specific clinical goal of reclaiming the 'Authentic Self' during the Rebuild phase?",
            "options": [
                "To return to the exact person the client was before the abuse occurred",
                "To achieve 'Self-Agency' by decoupling the client's self-worth from the abuser's projections",
                "To eliminate all narcissistic traits from the client's personality",
                "To ensure the client never experiences negative emotions again"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of reclaiming the Authentic Self is to achieve Self-Agency, which involves decoupling self-worth from the abuser's external projections and reclaiming the internal locus of control."

            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 190, how does 'Values-Based Living' specifically resolve the lingering Cognitive Dissonance found in survivors?",
            "options": [
                "By forcing the client to ignore the past and focus only on the future",
                "By creating a new set of rules that the survivor must follow to be 'good'",
                "By providing an internal compass that makes the abuser's behavior irrelevant to the client's current choices",
                "By aligning daily actions with core beliefs, which neurologically overrides the 'trauma bond' logic",
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Values-based living creates alignment between actions and beliefs. Neurologically, this consistency helps resolve cognitive dissonance by strengthening prefrontal cortex regulation over the limbic system's trauma responses."

            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "In the 'Advanced Reparenting' model (L191), what is the primary distinction between the 'Wounded Child' and the 'Functional Adult'?",
            "options": [
                "The Wounded Child is the client's past, and the Functional Adult is the client's future",
                "The Wounded Child holds the trauma responses, while the Functional Adult provides the safety and structure the client lacked in childhood",
                "The Functional Adult is a persona the client 'fakes' until they feel better",
                "The Wounded Child must be suppressed so the Functional Adult can take over"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced reparenting involves the Functional Adult (the healthy, present-day self) providing the emotional regulation and safety that the Wounded Child (the part holding trauma) never received."

            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "Lesson 192 distinguishes between 'Intuition' and 'Hypervigilance.' Which somatic marker is most indicative of a healthy 'Body Compass' (Intuition)?",
            "options": [
                "A rapid heart rate and 'butterfly' feeling in the stomach",
                "A sharp, urgent 'ping' of anxiety that demands immediate action",
                "A calm, grounded 'knowing' that persists even when external pressure is removed",
                "The ability to predict exactly what an abuser will do next"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intuition is characterized by a calm, grounded internal 'knowing.' Hypervigilance, by contrast, is an urgent, fear-based state of high arousal and scanning for external threats."

                "Writing a letter of grievance to his former partner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The intervention involved shifting the focus from the other person's reaction to Marcus's own core values. When a boundary is a reflection of personal integrity, the guilt of 'hurting' others diminishes."

                "Visualizing a golden light around the client's body during meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Shadow' refers to the positive, powerful, or creative aspects of the self that were suppressed or 'disowned' because they were perceived as threats to the abuser or the survivor's safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Vagal Tone are primary indicators of a regulated nervous system that can successfully oscillate between rest and activity, a hallmark of Phase 3 recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Containment Breath is a somatic tool used to help survivors stay present in their bodies and resist the 'Fawn' response (people-pleasing) when they need to assert a boundary."
