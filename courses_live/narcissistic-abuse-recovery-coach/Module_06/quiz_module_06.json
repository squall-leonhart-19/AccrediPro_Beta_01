            "question": "According to the Tedeschi and Calhoun model of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), what is the fundamental difference between resilience and PTG?",
            "options": [
                "Resilience is the ability to bounce back to baseline, while PTG involves a transformative shift beyond previous functioning.",
                "Resilience is only possible after physical trauma, while PTG is specific to emotional abuse.",
                "PTG is a temporary state of optimism, whereas resilience is a permanent personality trait.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Resilience refers to the ability to return to a baseline state after adversity, whereas PTG involves a 'seismic' shift in the survivor's world view that results in a higher level of functioning than existed prior to the trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a key protein that promotes neuroplasticity and the growth of new synaptic connections, which is essential for the neural rewiring process during recovery from narcissistic abuse."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "The survivor has a biological preference for high-conflict individuals.",
                "The unconscious mind attempts to 'master' the original trauma by recreating it and hoping for a different outcome.",
                "The survivor lacks the intelligence to recognize red flags after the first occurrence.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Repetition Compulsion is a psychological phenomenon where a person repeats a traumatic event or its circumstances in an unconscious attempt to gain mastery or 'fix' the original wound."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain; for survivors, learning to trust 'gut feelings' (somatic markers) is a critical step in restoring intuition."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
