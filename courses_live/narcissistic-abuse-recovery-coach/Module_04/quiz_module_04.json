            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client in a co-parenting situation finds that 'Grey Rocking' is escalating the narcissist's rage in court. Which advanced strategy involves adding 'polite fluff' (like 'Please' and 'Thank you') to remain professional while maintaining emotional distance?",

                "Radical Acceptance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Yellow Rocking is an advanced boundary technique used in legal or co-parenting situations where the coldness of Grey Rocking may look 'uncooperative' to a judge; it adds a layer of formal politeness without breaking the emotional boundary."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Introjected values are more stable over time than core values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjected values are external standards (often from an abuser or society) that a survivor has swallowed whole without digesting; reclaiming 'Core Values' is the process of choosing what truly matters to the self."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
