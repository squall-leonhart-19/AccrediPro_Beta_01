                "Optimism is a feeling, while elpis is a cognitive decision to ignore negative outcomes.",
                "Optimism is based on probability and circumstances, while elpis is a confident expectation based on God's character.",
                "Elpis is a passive wish for divine intervention, whereas optimism is an active psychological state.",
                "There is no functional difference; both rely on the 'Power of Positive Thinking' methodology."
