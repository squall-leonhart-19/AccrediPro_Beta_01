            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is responsible for executive functions, decision-making, and moderating social behavior. In Christian coaching, strengthening the PFC through spiritual disciplines allows for better regulation of the amygdala (the fear center)."
