        <h2 id="dual-relationships">1. Dual Relationships in Sacred Spaces</h2>
        <p>In the secular coaching world, <span class="highlight">dual relationships</span>—where a coach has more than one type of relationship with a client—are often strictly avoided to prevent conflicts of interest. However, in Christian coaching, particularly within the context of a local church, dual relationships are often unavoidable. A coach may also be a fellow small group member, a ministry leader, or a personal friend.</p>

        <p>The supervisor’s role is not necessarily to forbid these relationships, but to provide oversight that ensures the <span class="highlight">professional boundary</span> is not compromised. The risk in sacred spaces is "spiritual enmeshment," where the lines between coaching, discipleship, and social friendship become blurred, leading to a loss of objectivity and potential harm.</p>

        <h2 id="gatekeeping">2. The Supervisor as Gatekeeper</h2>
        <p>In the New Testament, elders and leaders are often described as "watchmen" or "shepherds" (Acts 20:28). In the context of the <span class="highlight">F.A.I.T.H. Coaching Method™</span>, the supervisor acts as a <span class="highlight">gatekeeper</span>. This role involves two critical functions: protecting the client from incompetent or unethical coaching, and protecting the profession (and the Body of Christ) from reputational damage.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            A 2022 study on ethical violations in spiritual care (n=1,450) indicated that 62% of reported issues stemmed from "competency overreach," where a spiritual provider attempted to treat clinical issues (like clinical depression or complex trauma) without proper training or referral (Jones et al., 2022).
        </div>

        <p>As a gatekeeper, the supervisor must be willing to make the difficult call: if a coach is consistently failing to maintain biblical standards, or if they are operating outside their scope of practice, the supervisor must intervene. This is not just administrative; it is an act of <span class="highlight">biblical stewardship</span>. We are stewarding the souls of those being coached.</p>

        <h2 id="legal-moral">3. Legal vs. Moral Obligations</h2>
        <p>One of the most complex areas of supervision is navigating the intersection of <span class="highlight">mandatory reporting</span> and <span class="highlight">spiritual confidentiality</span>. While coaching is generally not a "privileged" communication in the same legal sense as the confessional or a doctor-patient relationship, Christian coaches often feel a deep moral obligation to keep "sacred secrets."</p>

        <p>However, the Bible also commands us to protect the vulnerable (Psalm 82:3). Supervisors must ensure coaches understand that confidentiality is never absolute. It ends where the law begins—specifically regarding:
        <ul>
            <li>Suspected child abuse or neglect.</li>
            <li>Suspected elder abuse.</li>
            <li>Direct threats of self-harm or harm to others.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <div class="case-study">
            <div class="case-study-header">
                <strong>Case Study: The Confidentiality Dilemma</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="case-study-content">
                <p><strong>Coach:</strong> Sarah (L2 Certified)</p>
                <p><strong>Client:</strong> Mark, a prominent church deacon.</p>
                <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> During a coaching session on "Leadership Alignment," Mark confesses to Sarah that he has been physically abusive toward his teenage son in "fits of righteous anger." He begs Sarah to keep this between them, promising to work on his anger through the coaching process.</p>
                <p><strong>Supervisory Intervention:</strong> Sarah’s supervisor, David, recognizes that while Mark is seeking spiritual transformation, the legal obligation to report child abuse supersedes the coaching agreement. David guides Sarah through the reporting process, while also helping her manage the "spiritual fallout" of reporting a church leader. They work on a transition plan to refer Mark to a clinical therapist specializing in domestic violence while maintaining a supportive (but boundaried) spiritual presence.</p>

        <h2 id="stewardship-foundation">4. Stewardship of the 'F' (Foundation)</h2>
        <p>In Lesson 1.1, we established that the <span class="highlight">Foundation (F)</span> of our method is Biblical Authority. In a L3 supervisory capacity, you are the guardian of this foundation. Stewardship means ensuring that coaches do not drift into "moralistic therapeutic deism" or integrate "New Age" philosophies disguised as spiritual growth.</p>

        <p>Supervisors must ask: <em>"Is this intervention biblically grounded, or is it merely popular psychology with a verse attached?"</em> This requires the supervisor to have a high level of theological discernment. You are not just checking boxes; you are ensuring that the client's <span class="highlight">Metanoia</span> (Transformation) is rooted in the Word of God, not just self-actualization.</p>

        <h2 id="power-dynamics">5. Addressing Power Dynamics</h2>
        <p>The supervisory relationship is inherently hierarchical. If not managed with Christ-like humility, it can devolve into a form of <span class="highlight">spiritual abuse</span>, where the supervisor uses their "spiritual authority" to control or manipulate the coach. Similarly, coaches can exert undue influence over clients.</p>

        <p>Signs of unhealthy power dynamics in supervision include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The "Guru" Complex:</strong> The supervisor expects the coach to mimic their exact style and theology without room for individual calling.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Shaming:</strong> Using scripture to rebuke a coach's professional mistakes in a way that attacks their identity in Christ.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> Encouraging the coach to become overly dependent on the supervisor for every decision, rather than fostering professional autonomy.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            Research into ecclesiastical power dynamics suggests that "high-control" environments correlate with a 40% increase in burnout rates among ministry professionals (Smith & Miller, 2021).
        </div>

        <h2 id="humility">6. Humility in Oversight</h2>
        <p>Biblical stewardship of the coaching process requires a <span class="highlight">Kenotic</span> (self-emptying) approach to leadership. Based on Philippians 2:5-8, the supervisor should view their role as a servant-leader. The goal of supervision is the flourishing of the coach so that the client might flourish in Christ.</p>

        <p>This involves:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Admitting your own ethical "near-misses" to create a safe space for the coach to be honest.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual Accountability:</strong> Inviting the coach to provide feedback on the supervisory process.</li>
            <li><strong>Intercessory Supervision:</strong> Not just reviewing cases, but actively praying for the coach and their clients during the session.</li>
        </ul></p>

                <p class="question-text">1. A coach you supervise is coaching their pastor. What is the primary ethical risk you should address as a supervisor?</p>

                <div class="answer-text">The primary risk is a "power reversal" dual relationship.

                <div class="answer-text">Mentoring focuses on the growth and skill development of the coach (supportive/formative).
