            "question": "According to Peter Gollwitzer's research on Implementation Intentions, how much do 'If-Then' plans typically increase the probability of goal attainment compared to goal intentions alone?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 20-30%",
                "Approximately 50-60%",
                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) demonstrate that implementation intentions have a medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.65), representing a roughly 20-30% increase in goal attainment by automating the 'when, where, and how'."

            "question": "In the context of friction reduction (Lesson 2), if a client wants to stop mindlessly scrolling social media, which intervention represents 'increasing friction'?",
            "options": [
                "Setting a reminder to stop scrolling",
                "Moving the app icon to the third page of a folder and requiring a 15-character password",
                "Visualizing the negative consequences of scrolling",
                "Rewarding themselves for not scrolling at the end of the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increasing friction involves adding physical or cognitive steps to a behavior to make it harder to execute. Moving the app and requiring a complex password are structural changes to the environment that disrupt automaticity."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A study by the American Society of Training and Development (ASTD) found that having a specific accountability appointment with a person you've committed to increases the chance of goal success to what percentage?",

                "75%",
                "85%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The ASTD study found that while simply having an idea increases success to 10%, having a specific accountability appointment with someone increases the probability of success to a staggering 95%."

            "question": "Piers Steel's Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT) expresses motivation as a formula. Which factor in the denominator represents the client's sensitivity to the delay of the reward?",
            "options": [
                "Expectancy",
                "Value",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the TMT formula [Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (1 + Impulsiveness x Delay)], Impulsiveness is the individual's sensitivity to time, which multiplies the impact of the Delay."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are predictive and occur before the result (process-oriented), whereas lagging indicators (like weight or body fat) are retrospective measures of what has already happened."

            "question": "Bonezzi et al. (2011) identified the 'U-shaped' motivation curve. At what point in a project is a client most likely to experience a drop in motivation known as the 'Middle Muddle'?",
            "options": [
                "At the 10% mark, due to initial resistance",
                "At the 50% mark, when they are far from the start but still far from the end",
                "At the 90% mark, due to fear of completion",
                "Motivation actually increases linearly and does not drop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Middle Muddle' occurs when the initial excitement of the 'Fresh Start' has faded, and the 'End-of-Goal' surge hasn't yet kicked in, typically around the midpoint of a goal's timeline."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sunk Cost Fallacy is the tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even if the current costs outweigh the future benefits."

                "From Proactive to Reactive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable execution requires an Internal Locus of Control, where the client believes they have the agency and power to influence their outcomes without needing external pressure from a coach."

                "The client writes a journal entry about why they want to be healthy",
                "The client pre-portions healthy snacks in clear containers at eye-level in the fridge",
                "The client promises to call the coach when they feel an urge to eat",
                "The client watches a documentary on the dangers of sugar"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice Architecture involves organizing the environment to make the preferred choice the easiest one. Pre-portioning healthy snacks at eye-level reduces the cognitive load required to make a good decision during fatigue."

                "Quitting is fast; pivoting is slow",
                "Quitting is emotional; pivoting is logical",
                "Quitting abandons the vision; pivoting changes the strategy while keeping the vision",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A strategic pivot is a change in the 'how' (the strategy) based on feedback and data, while the 'why' (the ultimate goal or vision) remains constant. Quitting is the total abandonment of the goal."
