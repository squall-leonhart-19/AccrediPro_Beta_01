            "options": [
                "Linear plans use goals, while dynamic plans use only intuition.",
                "Dynamic plans account for feedback loops and emergent client needs, whereas linear plans assume a direct path to the outcome.",
                "Dynamic plans are shorter and require less documentation than linear plans.",
                "Linear plans are exclusively used for health coaching, while dynamic plans are for business coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced coaching architecture recognizes that human change is rarely linear; dynamic plans incorporate feedback loops to adjust for emerging variables and client shifts."

            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to do the work for the client initially.",
                "It provides temporary support structures that are gradually removed as the client's self-efficacy increases.",
                "It ensures the client never experiences any level of stress or discomfort.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the final goal rather than the steps to get there."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing a high level of support during the initial stages of learning a new skill or behavior, which is systematically tapered off as the client gains competence and confidence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 'If-Then' planning (contingency planning) significantly boosts goal attainment by automating responses to potential obstacles, often resulting in effect sizes in the medium-to-large range (d > 0.65)."
