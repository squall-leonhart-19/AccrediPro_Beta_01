            "question": "According to the principles of Neuroplasticity discussed in Lesson 1, what is 'Long-Term Potentiation' (LTP)?",
            "options": [
                "The process of neurons dying off due to lack of use.",
                "The persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity.",
                "The brain's inability to change after the age of 25.",
                "A temporary state of heightened focus during a coaching session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LTP is the cellular basis for learning and memory; it involves the strengthening of synaptic connections through repeated stimulation, often summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together.'"

            "question": "In the context of Cognitive Reframing (Lesson 2), what is the primary objective of 'Cognitive Defusion'?",
            "options": [
                "To prove to the client that their negative thoughts are factually incorrect.",
                "To suppress all negative emotions so the client can remain positive.",
                "To help the client observe thoughts as passing events rather than absolute truths.",
                "To replace every negative thought with a specific positive affirmation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion, a core concept in ACT, teaches clients to step back and observe their thoughts as language/images rather than being 'fused' with them as reality."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Gabriele Oettingen’s WOOP framework (Lesson 3) introduces 'Mental Contrasting.' Why is identifying the 'Obstacle' specifically after the 'Wish' and 'Outcome' effective?",
            "options": [
                "It creates a 'necessity to act' by highlighting the gap between reality and the goal.",
                "It discourages the client from pursuing goals that are too difficult.",
                "It focuses the brain entirely on external barriers like money or time.",
                "It ensures the client remains in a state of 'Indulging' without taking action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mental Contrasting (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle) creates a cognitive link between the future and the present reality, activating the motivation to overcome internal barriers."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client reaches a record-breaking sales month but suddenly starts picking fights with their partner. According to Lesson 4, this is a classic symptom of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gay Hendricks' 'Upper Limit Problem' suggests that individuals have an internal thermostat for how much success/love they can handle; when they exceed it, they often self-sabotage to return to their 'comfort zone.'"

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s Flow Model (Lesson 5), what state is a client likely in if the challenge is very high but their skill level is low?",
            "options": [
                "Boredom",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Flow occurs at the intersection of high challenge and high skill. When the challenge far outweighs the skill, the result is anxiety; when skill outweighs challenge, the result is boredom."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Affect Labeling' was discussed as a tool for Emotional Intelligence. What does neuroscience suggest happens when a client names their emotion?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala becomes more active, increasing the emotional response.",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex activity increases while Amygdala activity decreases.",
                "The client becomes 'trapped' in that emotion for a longer duration.",
                "There is no measurable change in brain activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 'putting feelings into words' (affect labeling) activates the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which in turn dampens the amygdala's emotional 'alarm' response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are predictive and influenceable activities (like daily calls) that lead to the 'Lagging' results (like total revenue or weight loss)."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "To measure the ROI of coaching (Lesson 8), a coach uses the 'Social Return on Investment' (SROI) metric. What does this primarily account for?",
            "options": [
                "The direct financial profit minus the cost of coaching.",
                "The ratio of social and environmental value created per dollar invested.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SROI is a principles-based method for measuring extra-financial value (such as environmental and social value not currently reflected in conventional financial accounts) relative to resources invested."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Based on Habit Architecture (Lesson 1), why is 'Habit Stacking' an effective strategy for lasting change?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for a reward in the habit loop.",
                "It uses an existing neural pathway (established habit) as a trigger for a new one.",
                "It focuses on changing the client's identity before their behavior.",
                "It relies on sheer willpower rather than environmental cues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking anchors a new behavior to an already automated neural circuit, making the 'cue' phase of the habit loop much stronger and more reliable."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "In the 'Goal Hierarchy' model (Lesson 3), what is the function of 'Subordinate Goals'?",
            "options": [
                "They represent the 'Why' and the core values of the client.",
                "They are the abstract visions that never change.",
                "They are the specific, actionable tasks and 'hows' that serve the higher-level goals.",
                "They are distractions that should be removed to focus on the 'Superordinate' goal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a goal hierarchy, Subordinate goals are the concrete, low-level actions (the 'how') that are flexible and provide the steps necessary to reach the stable, high-level Superordinate goals (the 'why')."
