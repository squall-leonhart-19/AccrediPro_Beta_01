            "question": "During the transition from 'Identify' to 'Focus' (L1), which prioritization principle suggests that 80% of a client's results will come from 20% of their efforts?",
            "options": [
                "The Eisenhower Matrix",
                "The Pareto Principle",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) is the core of strategic prioritization, helping clients identify the high-leverage activities that produce the majority of their desired outcomes."

            "options": [
                "It makes the goal feel more distant and impressive",
                "It focuses exclusively on the final reward rather than the work",
                "It identifies critical dependencies and 'bottleneck' tasks that are often missed in forward planning",
                "It eliminates the need for any mid-course corrections"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Backward mapping starts at the successful outcome and works backward to the present, which reveals necessary precursors and dependencies that forward-looking plans often overlook."

            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Execution Paralysis' (L3) due to a cognitive distortion where they believe one small mistake will ruin the entire project. This is known as:",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Dichotomous or All-or-Nothing thinking is a common cause of execution paralysis, where the client views performance in black-and-white terms, leading to a fear of any imperfection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As behaviors become repetitive and 'anchored,' the neurological processing shifts from the conscious Prefrontal Cortex to the Basal Ganglia, where habits are automated."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "When 'Measuring Progress' (L7), why is it critical for a coach to help a client track 'Lead Indicators' rather than just 'Lag Indicators'?",
            "options": [
                "Lead indicators are the final results and are more motivating",
                "Lag indicators are easier to influence in real-time",
                "Lead indicators represent the predictive actions that the client can actually control",
                "Lead indicators are only used in corporate coaching, not life coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lead indicators (like 'hours spent studying') are predictive and influenceable, whereas Lag indicators (like 'passing the exam') are historical data that cannot be changed once they occur."

                "The client should return to the Identify phase and choose a new goal",
                "The setback is viewed as a 'data point' to be analyzed to improve the next execution cycle",
                "The coach should increase the intensity of the accountability to prevent future errors",
                "The client should ignore the setback to maintain positive momentum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iterative refinement treats setbacks as feedback and data, allowing the coach and client to adjust the strategy without losing momentum or self-esteem."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Loss Aversion is the principle that the psychological pain of losing is twice as powerful as the joy of gaining, a key 'nudge' used in high-integrity accountability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-integrity accountability is about the coach holding a mirror to the client's own commitments and values, rather than acting as an external judge or enforcer."
