            "options": [
                "The tendency for group goals to be achieved 10% faster than individual goals",
                "The phenomenon where public commitment increases the psychological cost of failure, leading to higher consistency",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Social Multiplier Effect leverages the psychological cost of social 'loss of face' to increase commitment and consistency in goal execution."

            "question": "According to the Neuro-Behavioral Feedback Loop model, what happens during a 'Negative Prediction Error'?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine levels spike because the outcome was better than expected",
                "The brain ignores the feedback to protect the ego",
                "Dopamine neurons depress their firing rate because the reward was less than expected",
                "The client enters a state of flow despite the failure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Negative Prediction Error occurs when the outcome is worse than anticipated, leading to a drop in dopamine which signals the brain to update its behavior and avoid the action in the future."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A pivot is required when the rate at which you are gaining actionable insights (Velocity of Learning) is slower than the rate at which you are consuming capital, time, or energy (Velocity of Resource Depletion)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the brain region responsible for interoception—the sense of the internal state of the body—which is the foundation of somatic cues and 'gut' instincts."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Middle-Muddle' or 'The Dip' typically occurs when the initial excitement of the start has faded, but the 'goal-gradient effect' of the finish line has not yet kicked in, usually around the midpoint (40-60%)."

                "Threat appraisal increases cortisol; Challenge appraisal increases adrenaline only",
                "Threat appraisal focuses on potential loss; Challenge appraisal focuses on the potential for gain and personal growth",
                "Threat appraisal is conscious; Challenge appraisal is subconscious",
                "There is no physiological difference between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Challenge appraisal views a stressor as an opportunity to overcome and grow, which leads to more adaptive physiological responses compared to the defensive nature of threat appraisal."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Pre-Mortem involves assuming a project has failed and then brainstorming all possible reasons why, which helps identify risks and blind spots before the decision is finalized."

            "question": "In the Iterative L.I.F.E. Cycle, the 'E' stands for Execute. How does the 'Iterative' component change the execution phase?",
            "options": [
                "It requires the client to work 24/7 without breaks",
                "It mandates a 'fail fast' approach where execution is followed immediately by data collection and refinement",
                "It means the execution phase never actually ends",
                "It allows the client to skip the planning phase entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Iterative L.I.F.E. cycle emphasizes that execution is not a one-time event but a series of loops where data from each attempt informs the next 'Identify' and 'Focus' phase."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-Alignment Reframing resolves cognitive dissonance by ensuring the goal is seen as an expression of the client's deepest values rather than an external chore."
