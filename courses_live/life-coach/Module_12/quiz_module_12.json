            "question": "In the context of 'Mastering Subtext,' what does a 'prosodic shift' in a client's speech typically signify to an advanced coach?",
            "options": [
                "A natural variation in speech patterns with no clinical significance",
                "An incongruence between the client's verbal content and their underlying emotional state",
                "A sign that the client has reached the 'Execute' phase of the L.I.F.E. Blueprint",
                "The physiological manifestation of a successfully integrated schema"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prosody (tone, pitch, and rhythm) carries the emotional weight of a message. A shift often indicates that the subtext contradicts the spoken words, requiring the coach to probe deeper into the 'Listen' phase."

            "options": [
                "80% of results come from 20% of efforts, and 64% of results come from just 4% of efforts",
                "A coach should spend 80 minutes listening and 20 minutes speaking",
                "Prioritization should only happen in the final 20% of a coaching engagement",
                "Clients should attempt to solve 80 problems simultaneously to find the 20 that matter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 squared principle (4% of causes leading to 64% of results) emphasizes extreme focus on the 'vital few' leverage points within the 'Focus' methodology."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gollwitzer's research showed that implementation intentions (Behavioral Engineering) significantly close the 'intention-behavior gap,' often doubling the probability of goal completion."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is the persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity, which is the cellular basis for learning and memory in coaching."

                "Ignore their resistance and push through with willpower",
                "Deliberately engage in the 'problem' behavior or resistance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symptom prescription encourages the client to perform the behavior they usually struggle to control, which often removes the secondary gain of the resistance and returns a sense of agency."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological safety—the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes—is the foundation of group coaching success."

            "question": "In the case study of 'Client Sarah' (Module 12, Lesson 2), her 'Defectiveness/Shame' schema was triggered by feedback at work. What was the recommended intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate behavioral change without cognitive work",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlights that deep-seated schemas require cognitive reframing and practical tools like 'Schema Flashcards' to strengthen the 'Healthy Adult' mode during the transition from Listen to Focus."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The method is iterative. The 'Execute' phase provides new data and results that feed back into the 'Listen' phase for continuous mastery and refinement."
