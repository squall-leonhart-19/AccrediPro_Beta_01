                "Offering more flexible scheduling to accommodate the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L1 emphasizes that Signature Programs move away from 'trading time for money' and instead focus on architecting a systematic journey toward a guaranteed or highly probable outcome."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to the neuroplasticity principles discussed in L3, why is 'Intervention Sequencing' critical for client success?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to charge more for structured modules",
                "It prevents cognitive overload by respecting the limits of working memory and synaptic consolidation",
                "It ensures the client completes all homework assignments in order",
                "It focuses exclusively on Hebbian learning without considering synaptic pruning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 explains that sequencing interventions according to neurobiological readiness prevents 'cognitive flooding' and allows for Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) to occur before layering more complex tasks."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When utilizing Quantitative Outcome Measurement (L4), a coach calculates a Cohen's d effect size of 0.85 for a client's anxiety reduction. How is this result interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "A small effect with limited practical significance",
                "A medium effect indicating moderate program efficacy",

                "An insignificant result that requires a larger sample size"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In evidence-based practice, a Cohen's d of 0.8 or higher is statistically recognized as a 'large' effect size, demonstrating significant impact of the intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In a 'Flipped Classroom' Hybrid Model (L6), how should synchronous (live) coaching time be primarily utilized?",

                "Delivering long lectures on foundational theory",
                "Watching educational videos together with the client",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 teaches that in hybrid models, information delivery should be asynchronous (digital), while live time is reserved for the 'highest and best use': deep coaching and application."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical enrollment relies on a Gap Analysis to help the client realize the tangible distance between where they are and where they want to be, which creates the 'tension' necessary for change."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "A coach conducts a program evaluation and receives the following scores: 60% Promoters (9-10), 30% Passives (7-8), and 10% Detractors (0-6). What is the Net Promoter Score (NPS)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters (60% - 10% = 50). Passives are ignored in the final score calculation."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "If a coach identifies through 'Iterative Optimization' (L8) that 40% of clients stop engaging in Week 6, what is the most evidence-based first step?",

                "Increase the price of the program to ensure higher commitment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L8 emphasizes data-driven iteration. Before making changes, a coach must investigate the 'friction point' using qualitative and quantitative data to understand why the drop-off is occurring."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 notes that sequencing should begin with 'Keystone Habits' or 'Small Wins' to increase dopamine-driven motivation and build the self-efficacy required for more difficult future interventions."
