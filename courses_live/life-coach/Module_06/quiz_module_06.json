            "question": "In the context of Somatic Listening (L1), what is the primary role of the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) during a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "To regulate the client's respiratory rate during stressful disclosures",
                "To process 'gut feelings' via the 100 million neurons in the gastrointestinal tract",
                "To control the fine motor movements of the client's facial expressions",
                "To manage the prefrontal cortex's ability to map logical sequences"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ENS, often called the 'second brain,' contains roughly 100 million neurons and sends signals to the brain that coaches perceive as somatic intuition or 'gut feelings' regarding a client's unspoken truth."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Core Schemas are the deeply embedded mental blueprints that dictate how a client interprets reality. Identifying these is the key to uncovering the 'Hidden Why' behind their resistance or success."

                "It suggests that 80% of clients will resist 20% of the coaching interventions",
                "It states that 80% of results come from 20% of the high-leverage activities",
                "It requires the coach to listen 80% of the time and speak only 20%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gollwitzer (1999) demonstrated that 'If-Then' plans (e.g., 'If situation X arises, then I will perform behavior Y') significantly increase the likelihood of goal attainment by automating the response."

            "question": "A client consistently fails to complete a task that would lead to a promotion. In Navigating Resistance (L5), this is often identified as 'Secondary Gain.' What does this mean?",
            "options": [
                "The client is receiving a hidden benefit from staying stuck (e.g., avoiding more responsibility)",

                "The coach is gaining more from the session than the client is",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Secondary Gain refers to the hidden advantages a person receives from maintaining a 'problem' behavior, such as the safety of the status quo or the avoidance of potential failure."

                "Outcome goals are too easy to achieve",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Process goals (behaviors) are within the client's direct control, which reduces anxiety and builds self-efficacy, ultimately leading to the desired outcome more reliably."

            "question": "A coach notices a client crossing their arms and looking away when a specific goal is mentioned, despite the client saying 'I'm excited about this.' Which technique should the coach use first?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Noting an incongruence between verbal and somatic cues (L1) requires the coach to use curious, non-judgmental inquiry to help the client explore their internal resistance."
