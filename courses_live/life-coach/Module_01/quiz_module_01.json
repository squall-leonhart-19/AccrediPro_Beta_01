            "question": "According to the 2010 study by Stephens, Silbert, and Hasson on 'neural coupling,' what occurs in the brain during deep, engaged listening?",
            "options": [
                "The listener's brain activity mirrors the speaker's brain activity with a slight temporal delay.",
                "The listener's prefrontal cortex shuts down to allow the amygdala to process emotion.",
                "The listener's brain waves move into a Delta state to facilitate subconscious processing.",
                "There is a total decoupling of the parietal lobe to prevent external distractions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research shows that successful communication involves 'neural coupling,' where the listener's brain activity patterns become synchronous with the speaker's, often predicting the speaker's upcoming words."

                "Level 2: Focused Listening",

                "Level 4: Intuitive Synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Level 3 listening moves beyond the words and the individual to include the entire environment, the 'field' of energy, and the intuitive 'gut' feelings the coach experiences."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client says, 'I feel like I'm drowning in work and no one sees how hard I'm trying.' The coach responds by repeating the phrase 'drowning in work' with the same inflection. This is an example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-expressions are involuntary facial expressions that occur within 1/15th to 1/25th of a second, revealing true emotions before the person can consciously mask them."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic silence allows the client's 'Internal Critic' to quiet down, often resulting in the client sharing more profound or vulnerable information that follows the initial response."

                "It is the gold standard of the AccrediPro methodology for building trust.",
                "It reduces the client's cortisol levels more effectively than empathetic listening."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rehearsing is a common listening block where the coach is more focused on their own performance and 'what to say next' than on actually hearing the client's current message."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach's calm presence acts as a 'co-regulator,' helping the client's nervous system enter the Ventral Vagal state, which is necessary for creativity, connection, and change."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Incongruence occurs when the verbal message does not match the non-verbal cues. A Level 3 listener picks up on this discordance to explore the client's underlying hesitation."
