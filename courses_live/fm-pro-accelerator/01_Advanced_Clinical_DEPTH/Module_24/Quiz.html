    <h2>Quiz: Specialty Populations</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p>1. A 68-year-old female presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. She has a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Her current TSH is 6.8 mIU/L (reference range 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), Free T4 is 0.8 ng/dL (reference range 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), and TPO antibodies are elevated. She is also taking a calcium supplement for osteopenia. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention, considering her age and concurrent condition?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> A) Initiate levothyroxine at 50 mcg daily.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> B) Initiate levothyroxine at 100 mcg daily.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> C) Advise the patient to discontinue the calcium supplement and retest TSH and Free T4 in 6 weeks.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> D) Initiate liothyronine (T3) at 5 mcg twice daily.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: A) Initiate levothyroxine at 50 mcg daily.</p>
            <p>Explanation: In elderly patients, it's crucial to start levothyroxine at a lower dose (e.g., 25-50 mcg) to avoid cardiac complications. The presence of elevated TSH and low Free T4 confirms hypothyroidism. While calcium can interfere with levothyroxine absorption, addressing the hypothyroidism is the priority. Starting with a lower dose and monitoring is the safest approach. Liothyronine is generally not a first-line treatment due to its shorter half-life and potential for cardiac side effects.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. A 32-year-old pregnant woman (10 weeks gestation) presents with anxiety, palpitations, and mild tremor. Her TSH is 0.1 mIU/L (reference range 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), and Free T4 is 2.0 ng/dL (reference range 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). She has no personal or family history of thyroid disease. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> A) Prescribe methimazole to control hyperthyroidism.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> B) Prescribe propranolol to manage symptoms.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> C) Order a thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay and a thyroid ultrasound.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> D) Reassure the patient that these symptoms are normal during pregnancy.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: C) Order a thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay and a thyroid ultrasound.</p>
            <p>Explanation:  While mild hyperthyroidism can occur in early pregnancy due to hCG's thyroid-stimulating effect, these levels warrant further investigation to rule out Graves' disease (which is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy). A TSI assay can confirm Graves' disease. A thyroid ultrasound can assess for nodules or other structural abnormalities.  Methimazole is generally avoided in the first trimester due to teratogenic risks. Propranolol can mask symptoms but doesn't address the underlying cause. Dismissing the symptoms is inappropriate given the abnormal thyroid function tests.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>3. You are managing a 70-year-old male with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (stage 3). He is currently on metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. He reports increasing fatigue and muscle weakness. Which of the following nutritional recommendations is MOST crucial to assess and potentially modify, given his comorbidities?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> A) Carbohydrate intake and glycemic control.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> B) Protein intake and renal function.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> C) Fat intake and lipid profile.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> D) Sodium intake and blood pressure.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: B) Protein intake and renal function.</p>
            <p>Explanation: In patients with chronic kidney disease, protein intake needs careful monitoring. Excessive protein can exacerbate kidney damage. While carbohydrate, fat, and sodium intake are all important for managing diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, respectively, the potential impact of protein on renal function is the most immediate concern in this patient with stage 3 CKD.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>4. A 45-year-old female vegan presents with persistent fatigue, hair loss, and brittle nails. She reports adhering to a strict vegan diet for the past 5 years. Which of the following micronutrient deficiencies is MOST likely contributing to her symptoms?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> A) Vitamin C.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> B) Vitamin D.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> C) Vitamin B12.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> D) Vitamin A.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: C) Vitamin B12.</p>
            <p>Explanation: Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, making vegans particularly susceptible to deficiency. Symptoms of B12 deficiency include fatigue, weakness, neurological problems, and macrocytic anemia. While other micronutrient deficiencies can occur in vegans, B12 is the most critical to address due to its absence in a typical vegan diet. Vitamin D deficiency is also common, but less specific to veganism and often related to sun exposure.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>5. A 28-year-old male with a history of anorexia nervosa (currently in recovery) presents with amenorrhea.  His BMI is currently 19.5 kg/m².  Which of the following is the MOST likely underlying cause of his amenorrhea?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> A) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> B) Hypothalamic amenorrhea.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> C) Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d"> D) Thyroid dysfunction.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: B) Hypothalamic amenorrhea.</p>
            <p>Explanation: Hypothalamic amenorrhea is a common consequence of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. It results from suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis due to inadequate energy availability. While his BMI is improving, it's likely still impacting his hormonal balance. PCOS, POI, and thyroid dysfunction are less likely in this clinical context without other supporting findings.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6. You are advising a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She has a history of migraines with aura. Which of the following HRT regimens is generally considered the SAFEST option for her, considering her migraine history?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> A) Oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> B) Transdermal estradiol combined with oral progesterone.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c"> C) Oral estradiol combined with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d"> D) Subcutaneous estradiol pellets.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: B) Transdermal estradiol combined with oral progesterone.</p>
            <p>Explanation: Transdermal estradiol bypasses first-pass metabolism in the liver, potentially reducing the risk of triggering migraines compared to oral estrogens.  Migraines with aura are a relative contraindication to oral estrogen due to the increased risk of stroke.  While other options might be considered, transdermal estradiol is generally favored for its lower risk profile in this population. Subcutaneous pellets are less controllable in terms of dosing and are generally not first-line.  The IUD is primarily for endometrial protection with estrogen therapy.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>7. A 62-year-old male presents with new-onset erectile dysfunction. He is also being treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His medication list includes hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin. Which of the following lifestyle modifications is MOST likely to improve his erectile function, considering his medical history and medications?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> A) Increasing his water intake.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> B) Starting a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> C) Reducing his sodium intake.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="d"> D) Incorporating regular aerobic exercise and addressing potential zinc deficiency.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: D) Incorporating regular aerobic exercise and addressing potential zinc deficiency.</p>
            <p>Explanation: Regular aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health, which is crucial for erectile function. Erectile dysfunction is often a sign of underlying vascular issues. Hydrochlorothiazide can sometimes contribute to erectile dysfunction and zinc deficiency can worsen it.  While HIIT can be beneficial, a gentler aerobic approach is often better tolerated initially. Addressing underlying vascular health and nutrient deficiencies is key.  Increased water intake and reduced sodium are generally good for hypertension but less directly impactful on erectile function.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>8.  You are developing a nutritional plan for a 16-year-old female athlete with iron deficiency anemia. She is a long-distance runner and reports heavy menstrual periods. Beyond iron supplementation, which dietary strategy is MOST important to emphasize to improve iron absorption?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> A) Increasing calcium intake to strengthen bones.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> B) Consuming heme iron sources (e.g., red meat) if possible.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="c"> C) Avoiding caffeine consumption with meals.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="d"> D) Pairing non-heme iron sources (e.g., spinach) with vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., citrus fruits).</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: D) Pairing non-heme iron sources (e.g., spinach) with vitamin C-rich foods (e.g., citrus fruits).</p>
            <p>Explanation: Vitamin C significantly enhances the absorption of non-heme iron, which is the type of iron found in plant-based foods. Given her age and potential reluctance to consume large amounts of red meat, emphasizing this strategy is crucial. While heme iron is more readily absorbed, optimizing non-heme iron absorption is a practical and sustainable approach. Calcium can interfere with iron absorption, and caffeine can inhibit it to some degree, so avoiding them with meals is a secondary consideration.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>9. A 35-year-old woman with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is trying to conceive. She is currently on metformin and clomiphene citrate.  Despite ovulation induction with clomiphene, she has not conceived after three cycles.  Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate to consider next, *before* referring her for more invasive fertility treatments?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> A) Increasing the dose of clomiphene citrate.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> B) Adding letrozole to her treatment regimen.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c"> C) Initiating in vitro fertilization (IVF).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d"> D) Assessing and addressing potential insulin resistance with lifestyle modifications and potentially adding inositol.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: D) Assessing and addressing potential insulin resistance with lifestyle modifications and potentially adding inositol.</p>
            <p>Explanation: Insulin resistance is a key factor in PCOS-related infertility. Optimizing insulin sensitivity through diet, exercise, and supplements like inositol can improve ovulation and pregnancy rates. Before resorting to more invasive treatments like IVF, addressing the underlying metabolic dysfunction is crucial. Letrozole is an alternative to clomiphene but doesn't address the insulin resistance. Increasing the clomiphene dose may increase side effects without necessarily improving outcomes if insulin resistance is the primary issue.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>10. A 50-year-old perimenopausal woman presents with hot flashes, night sweats, and insomnia. She is hesitant to use hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Which of the following herbal remedies has the STRONGEST evidence base for reducing vasomotor symptoms and is generally considered safe for long-term use, assuming no contraindications?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="a"> A) Black cohosh.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="b"> B) Red clover.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="c"> C) Dong quai.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="d"> D) St. John's Wort.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: A) Black cohosh.</p>
            <p>Explanation: Black cohosh has the most robust evidence supporting its efficacy in reducing hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. While some earlier studies raised concerns about liver toxicity, more recent research suggests it is generally safe for long-term use when used appropriately and under supervision. Red clover has weaker evidence. Dong quai has limited evidence and potential safety concerns. St. John's Wort is primarily used for depression and can interact with other medications.</p>
