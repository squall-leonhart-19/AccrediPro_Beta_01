    <div class="question">
        <p>1. **Case Study:** Dr. Anya Sharma, a solo FM practitioner, consistently generates $300,000 in gross revenue annually but struggles with high overhead (65%). She desires to increase her net income while maintaining her current patient volume. Which of the following strategies would be the MOST effective INITIAL step to improve her income mastery?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a">A) Immediately implement a premium package offering, increasing prices by 50%.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b">B) Conduct a thorough expense audit to identify and eliminate unnecessary costs.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c">C) Invest heavily in marketing to attract new patients who can afford higher fees.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d">D) Reduce her appointment times to see more patients per day, increasing revenue.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>.  A thorough expense audit is the most logical first step. Reducing overhead immediately and directly impacts net income. Options A and C involve risk and upfront investment, while option D could lead to decreased patient satisfaction and potentially burnout.
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. A functional medicine practice is considering offering a comprehensive gut health program priced at $2500. Market research suggests a potential demand of 20 patients per month. However, the program requires hiring a health coach at a salary of $60,000/year and purchasing specialized lab testing equipment costing $10,000 upfront. What is the break-even point (in number of patients) for this program in the FIRST year?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a">A) 28</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b">B) 32</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c">C) 36</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d">D) 40</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: A</strong>. Break-even point = (Fixed Costs) / (Price per unit - Variable cost per unit). Fixed Costs = $60,000 (coach salary) + $10,000 (equipment) = $70,000. Assuming lab costs are included in the $2500 price per unit and no other variable costs are present, the break-even point = $70,000 / $2500 = 28 patients.

    <div class="question">
        <p>3.  You are negotiating a contract with a new supplement vendor. They offer a 20% discount on all orders over $5,000, with net 60 payment terms. Your current vendor offers a 15% discount on all orders, but requires net 30 payment terms. Which factor is MOST critical to consider when evaluating these offers?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a">A) The absolute percentage difference in discount (5%).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b">B) The potential impact on your practice's cash flow.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c">C) The reputation and quality of supplements offered by each vendor.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d">D) The minimum order quantity required to qualify for the discount.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>. While all factors are important, cash flow is paramount. Longer payment terms (net 60) can significantly improve cash flow, allowing for reinvestment in the practice. A small discount difference may be outweighed by the cash flow benefits.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>4. Which of the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is MOST directly related to the financial health and sustainability of a functional medicine practice?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a">A) Number of social media followers.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b">B) Patient satisfaction scores.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c">C) Average revenue per patient.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d">D) Website traffic.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: C</strong>. Average revenue per patient directly impacts the practice's profitability. While the other options are important for marketing and patient retention, they don't directly translate to financial health as effectively as revenue per patient.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>5. A practitioner is considering hiring a virtual assistant (VA) to handle administrative tasks. The VA's hourly rate is $25, and the practitioner estimates they will need 20 hours of VA support per week. What is the MOST important consideration when determining the ROI of hiring this VA?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a">A) The VA's previous experience in the healthcare industry.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b">B) The practitioner's billable hours freed up by the VA's assistance and the revenue generated from those hours.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c">C) The VA's proficiency in social media marketing.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d">D) The VA's ability to schedule patient appointments efficiently.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>. The ROI is directly tied to the practitioner's increased billable hours. The cost of the VA must be offset by the revenue generated from the time the practitioner gains by delegating tasks.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6. A functional medicine practice is experiencing a high rate of no-shows for initial consultations. Which of the following strategies is MOST likely to reduce no-show rates and improve revenue?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a">A) Sending reminder emails 24 hours before the appointment.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b">B) Implementing a non-refundable deposit for initial consultations.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c">C) Reducing the length of initial consultations.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d">D) Offering a discount for patients who arrive on time.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>. A non-refundable deposit creates a financial commitment, making patients more likely to attend. While reminders are helpful, a deposit adds a significant incentive.
        </div>
    </div>

   <div class="question">
        <p>7. You are considering offering group coaching programs in addition to individual consultations. What is the PRIMARY benefit of group coaching from an income mastery perspective?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a">A) It allows for more personalized attention to each patient.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="b">B) It reduces the workload for administrative staff.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="c">C) It allows you to leverage your time and generate more revenue per hour.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="d">D) It attracts a more affluent patient base.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: C</strong>. Group coaching allows you to see multiple patients simultaneously, increasing your hourly revenue potential. This is a key principle of leveraging your time for increased income.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>8.  A functional medicine practice is consistently booked 3 months in advance.  Which of the following strategies would be MOST effective in maximizing revenue without increasing the number of appointments?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a">A) Offer a shorter, less expensive "express" consultation.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b">B) Increase prices for all services.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="c">C) Offer a discount for patients who book appointments further in advance.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="d">D) Reduce the time allocated for each appointment.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>. High demand (being booked 3 months out) indicates price inelasticity. Increasing prices will likely increase revenue without significantly affecting patient volume.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>9. **Scenario:** Dr. Patel wants to implement a recurring revenue model in her practice. Which of the following offerings would BEST align with this goal?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a">A) A one-time comprehensive detoxification program.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b">B) A monthly subscription for access to educational webinars and Q&A sessions.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c">C) A discount on lab testing for new patients.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d">D) A referral bonus for existing patients who bring in new clients.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>. A subscription model provides consistent, predictable income each month. The other options are transactional and do not guarantee recurring revenue.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>10. A practice is considering investing in a new piece of diagnostic equipment costing $50,000.  The equipment is expected to generate an additional $20,000 in revenue per year but will also require $5,000 per year in maintenance and supplies. What is the payback period (in years) for this investment?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="a">A) 2 years</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="b">B) 2.5 years</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="c">C) 3.33 years</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="d">D) 4 years</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Correct Answer: C</strong>. Payback period = Initial Investment / Annual Net Cash Flow.  Annual Net Cash Flow = $20,000 (revenue) - $5,000 (expenses) = $15,000. Payback period = $50,000 / $15,000 = 3.33 years.
