            "question": "In Palliative and Hospice Care (Lesson 1), what is the primary energetic objective during the 'active dying' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Attempting to revitalize the physical organs to prolong life",
                "Clearing the 'exit portals' and facilitating a peaceful transition of the consciousness",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In hospice care, the focus shifts from physical restoration to 'transition support,' which involves clearing the biofield and exit portals to allow for a peaceful release of consciousness."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to the protocol for Pre-Surgical Energetic Support, when is the 'calming the field' intervention most critical?",
            "options": [
                "24-48 hours prior to surgery to modulate the sympathetic nervous system",
                "During the surgery while the patient is under anesthesia",
                "One week after the surgery has been completed",
                "Only if the patient experiences a complication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pre-surgical work is most effective 24-48 hours before the procedure to lower cortisol levels and move the patient from a 'fight-or-flight' state into a parasympathetic state, which improves surgical outcomes."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Why does Pediatric Energy Medicine (Lesson 3) require shorter session durations (typically 15-20 minutes) compared to adults?",
            "options": [
                "Children have less energy to work with than adults",
                "Children's biofields are more fluid and respond significantly faster to energetic shifts",
                "Legal regulations prevent longer sessions for minors",
                "Children's chakras are not fully formed until age 18"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children possess highly plastic and fluid biofields that have not yet developed the 'energetic armor' often found in adults, allowing for much more rapid integration of healing frequencies."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In the management of Chronic Pain (Lesson 4), what is the goal of 'Neural-Energetic Integration'?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress all physical sensations in the affected limb",
                "To move the pain from one part of the body to another",
                "To disrupt the 'pain-loop' frequency and desensitize the central nervous system's over-firing",
                "To convince the client that the pain is purely imaginary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic pain often involves a 'wind-up' phenomenon in the nervous system; energy medicine aims to disrupt this persistent signaling loop and reset the neural-energetic threshold."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "When working with High-Performance Athletes (Lesson 5), 'Energetic Tapering' is used to:",

                "Drain excess energy so the athlete stays calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energetic tapering involves specific techniques to stop 'leaking' energy and instead condense the athlete's field, ensuring maximum energetic resources are available for the competition."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Which trauma-informed principle is essential in Lesson 6 to prevent 'flooding' or retraumatization during a session?",

                "Encouraging the client to relive the trauma in detail",
                "Titration—working in small, manageable increments while maintaining an energetic 'anchor'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of processing trauma in small 'bites' to ensure the nervous system is not overwhelmed, which is critical for clients with PTSD or C-PTSD."

            "id": "q27_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While not a cure for cancer, energy healing is a powerful integrative tool for managing the debilitating side effects of conventional treatment, particularly fatigue, nausea, and anxiety."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Advanced Remote Healing (Lesson 8) utilizes the principle of 'Non-locality.' What does this mean for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner must be within 50 miles of the client",
                "Healing is only possible if the practitioner and client are on the same phone call",
                "Intentionality and energetic influence are not restricted by physical distance or time",
                "Remote healing only works on people the practitioner has met in person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-locality, supported by quantum entanglement theories, suggests that the biofield can be influenced through focused intent regardless of the physical distance between the practitioner and the subject."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 2 showed that patients receiving post-surgical energetic support often experience:",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinical observations and studies mentioned in the module show a statistically significant reduction (often 15-20%) in the requirement for post-operative pain medication when energetic support is used."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "When adapting protocols for Planetary Biofield Work (Lesson 8), what is the 'Macro-Micro' principle?",
            "options": [
                "The idea that practitioners should only work on small problems",
                "The concept that the individual biofield is a reflection of the larger collective/planetary field",
                "The requirement to use a microscope during healing sessions",
                "The belief that large groups of healers are less effective than one single healer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Macro-Micro principle suggests a holographic relationship where healing the 'micro' (individual) contributes to the 'macro' (planetary) and vice versa."
