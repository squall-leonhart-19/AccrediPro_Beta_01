            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Surgical incisions create 'energetic gaps' or short circuits in the biofield. Energetic Bridging focuses on restoring the flow across these disruptions to accelerate tissue regeneration."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Epigenetic Signature refers to the chemical modifications (like methylation) that change how genes are expressed, often influenced by the energetic and emotional experiences of ancestors."

                "Spaces are physical rooms; Fields are the people within them",
                "Spaces involve residual imprints; Fields involve active, dynamic energetic interactions",
                "Clearing a space requires salt; clearing a field requires sound",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clearing a Space addresses 'stagnant' or residual energy left in a location, whereas Clearing a Field addresses the 'living' and interactive energetic exchange occurring within a environment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In GDV/Bio-Well analysis, gaps or fragmented patterns in the captured 'glow' (electron emission) correlate to areas of lower energetic vitality or disruption in the corresponding physiological systems."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a crisis, the client's energy is often fragmented or 'up and out.' The practitioner must first center and ground the client to stabilize the nervous system before any deeper work can be done."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neutralization does not erase history; it removes the 'energetic hook' or emotional charge of the ancestral trauma so it no longer dictates the client's current health or behavior."
