            "question": "In the context of 'Quantum Foundations of Biofield Assessment' (B), what does the Principle of Non-Locality imply for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Healing can only occur when the practitioner is within 3 feet of the client",
                "The biofield is restricted to the physical boundaries of the skin",
                "Energetic signatures can be accessed and influenced regardless of spatial distance",
                "Quantum assessment requires the use of physical diagnostic machinery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-locality suggests that the biofield is not limited by Newtonian space-time, allowing for distance healing and the perception of energetic signatures beyond the immediate physical vicinity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An energetic cyst is a concept where the body 'walls off' a specific trauma or disharmonious frequency, creating a localized density that can impede the flow of lifeforce."
