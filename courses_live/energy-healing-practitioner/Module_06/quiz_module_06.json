            "question": "In the context of the Biofield, how is 'stagnant' energetic congestion typically differentiated from 'erratic' congestion during a manual scan?",
            "options": [
                "Stagnant energy feels hot and pulsing, while erratic energy feels cold and still.",
                "Stagnant energy presents as density or 'heaviness,' while erratic energy feels like sharp, prickly, or 'nervous' vibrations.",
                "Stagnant energy is always located in the outer auric layers, while erratic energy is found only in the chakras.",
                "There is no tactile difference; they can only be distinguished through intuitive visualization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stagnant energy is characterized by a lack of movement and perceived density (sluggishness), whereas erratic energy indicates over-activity or trauma, often felt as tingling, heat, or sharp sensations."

            "question": "A 2022 clinical observation of energy practitioners (n=150) found that what percentage of biofield distortions were identified as 'thermal variances' rather than 'pressure variances'?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "42%",
                "68%",
                "91%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 68% of practitioners primarily detect field distortions through temperature changes (heat/cold) before they perceive pressure or density changes."

            "question": "When performing the 'Sweeping' method for manual clearing, what is the primary mechanical goal of the downward motion?",
            "options": [
                "To push the energy deeper into the client's physical tissues for absorption.",
                "To move congested energy toward the extremities and out into the Earth for transmutation.",
                "To seal the client's chakras so no further energy can enter.",
                "To increase the client's blood pressure to stimulate detoxification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sweeping is a centrifugal movement designed to move surface-level debris away from the core and toward the ground or extremities for release."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "417 Hz is the standard frequency used in sound healing to clear 'heavy' energy and facilitate the removal of energetic blocks or past traumas."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'C' stands for 'Cleanse and Contain,' which involves removing existing debris (Cleansing) and then establishing a boundary (Containment) to prevent immediate re-contamination."

            "options": [
                "They create a vacuum that sucks oxygen out of the room.",
                "They increase the positive ion count to stimulate the nervous system.",
                "They utilize high-frequency molecular structures to neutralize low-frequency energetic residues.",
                "They are used purely for the placebo effect to make the client feel comfortable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sacred elements like salt (crystalline structure) and resins (high-frequency smoke) act as energetic filters, neutralizing the 'heavy' low-frequency ions often left by stress or illness."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Marcus' presents with an energetic cord linked to a former business partner that feels 'draining' and 'sharp.' Which approach is most ethically sound for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Forcefully 'cutting' the cord without the client's conscious participation.",
                "Ignoring the cord and focusing only on the Root chakra.",
                "Facilitating a 'De-linking' process where the client consciously retracts their energy and dissolves the connection.",
                "Telling Marcus to confront the business partner physically to break the link."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional de-linking should be a collaborative process where the client reclaims their own energy rather than a violent 'cutting,' which can cause energetic 'snap-back' or trauma."

            "id": "q6_8",

            "options": [
                "Take a 20-minute nap to recover lost vitality.",
                "Perform a 'Salt-Water Wash' or cold water submersion of the hands and forearms.",
                "Immediately see the next client to maintain the flow of energy.",
                "Drink a high-sugar beverage to replace glucose levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cold water and salt act as physical and energetic neutralizers, helping to 'ground' the practitioner and remove any 'hitchhiking' energetic debris from the session."

                "Wide-spread, thin auric leaks.",
                "Deep-seated, localized 'clots' or masses of stagnant energy.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scooping is a more intensive, localized technique used to reach deeper into the field to remove specific 'masses' or 'clots' of energy that sweeping cannot move."

            "question": "When assessing the 'Environment' (L6), a practitioner notes a significant drop in the room's 'vibrational clarity' after a session. What is the most likely cause of this 'energetic 'hangover'?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner forgot to turn off the lights.",
                "The client's released energetic debris has saturated the room's 'etheric fabric.'",
                "The room is too small for the healing work.",
                "The practitioner's own shield was too thick."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During clearing, energy is moved out of the client's field and into the surrounding space; if not cleared from the room, this debris creates an 'energetic hangover' or saturation in the environment."
