            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "According to the definition established by the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992, the 'Biofield' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A purely electromagnetic field generated exclusively by the heart's rhythmic contractions.",
                "A massless field, not necessarily electromagnetic, that surrounds and permeates living bodies and affects the body's health.",
                "A chemical gradient found within the extracellular matrix of connective tissue.",
                "The sum total of all heat signatures emitted by the body during metabolic processes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NIH defined the biofield as a massless field that surrounds and permeates living bodies, emphasizing its role in regulating biological functions beyond simple electromagnetism."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When assessing the 'Etheric Body' (the first layer of the HEF), a practitioner is typically scanning within what distance from the physical body?",
            "options": [
                "0.25 to 2 inches",
                "12 to 18 inches",
                "3 to 5 feet",
                "8 to 10 feet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Etheric body is the innermost layer of the Human Energy Field, typically extending 0.25 to 2 inches from the physical skin, acting as the bridge between energy and matter."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In haptic scanning, a sensation described as 'dense, sticky, or heavy' is most frequently associated with which type of energetic disturbance?",
            "options": [
                "An energetic leak or tear",
                "A localized depletion of vitality",
                "Energetic congestion or stagnation",
                "A healthy state of high-frequency coherence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Congestion or stagnation is characterized by a 'thick' or 'sticky' feeling in the practitioner's hands, indicating an accumulation of low-frequency energy that is not circulating properly."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding Biofield Coherence found that a 'Phase-Locked' state between practitioner and client is characterized by:",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in the practitioner's heart rate to below 50 BPM.",
                "The synchronization of biological rhythms, such as HRV, between the two individuals.",
                "A complete cessation of biophoton emission in the client.",
                "The practitioner's field overwhelming and replacing the client's field."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic coherence often manifests as 'entrainment' or 'phase-locking,' where the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and other biological rhythms of the practitioner and client synchronize."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "The Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV) technology, developed by Dr. Konstantin Korotkov, measures the biofield by analyzing:",

                "The speed of blood flow through the radial artery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GDV technology uses high-intensity electromagnetic fields to stimulate the emission of electrons and photons from the fingertips, which are then captured and analyzed to assess the state of the biofield."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "During the intake process, why is it vital to establish a 'Baseline Map' before starting the actual energy balancing session?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client is paying attention to the practitioner.",
                "To differentiate between the client's chronic energetic patterns and temporary fluctuations caused by the environment.",
                "Because the law requires a visual map for all energy healing sessions.",
                "To prevent the practitioner from becoming too tired during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A baseline map allows the practitioner to identify long-standing patterns (traits) versus temporary responses to immediate stress (states), providing a clear metric for the session's efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Sarah' presents with acute exhaustion. Upon scanning, the practitioner feels a 'cool, outward-flowing breeze' near the solar plexus. This most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "A healthy, vibrant energy center.",
                "Energetic congestion requiring vigorous clearing.",
                "An energetic leak or 'hemorrhage' of vitality.",
                "The presence of a parasitic energetic attachment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'cool breeze' or a 'pulling' sensation often indicates a leak or tear in the biofield where the client's vital force is escaping, leading to symptoms of acute exhaustion."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "What does the 'Observer Effect' in quantum physics imply for the Biofield Assessment process?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner should stare intensely at the client to increase energy flow.",
                "The act of observing and assessing the field can inherently change the state of the field.",
                "The client's field is only visible if the practitioner uses a specialized camera.",
                "Assessment is impossible because the biofield disappears when looked at."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Observer Effect suggests that the consciousness and expectations of the practitioner (the observer) can influence the behavior of the energy being measured, necessitating a state of 'neutrality'."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Research on biophoton emission (ultra-weak light emission) suggests that a healthy, coherent organism displays:",
            "options": [
                "Extremely high, erratic bursts of light emission.",
                "A total absence of light emission.",
                "A low-intensity, steady, and highly rhythmic emission of photons.",
                "Light emission only from the eyes and the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Healthy biophoton emission is characterized by 'coherence,' meaning the light is emitted at a steady, low-intensity rate with high degrees of order, reflecting efficient internal communication."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which ethical protocol is most important when a practitioner identifies a significant 'void' or disturbance in the client's field?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately providing a medical diagnosis based on the location of the void.",
                "Informing the client they have a serious disease to ensure they take the session seriously.",
                "Maintaining neutrality and describing the sensation as an 'energetic finding' rather than a physical pathology.",
                "Refusing to work with the client until they see a surgeon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must operate within their scope of practice, which involves assessing and balancing energy. They should never provide medical diagnoses but should describe findings in energetic terms."
