            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "In Advanced Biofield Mapping, what does a 'hyper-resonant' (red/orange) zone typically indicate during a 3D scan?",
            "options": [
                "A state of energetic depletion or chronic stagnation",
                "Acute inflammatory processes or excessive sympathetic nervous system activity",
                "A balanced flow of Prana through the secondary meridians",
                "The presence of a parasitic energetic attachment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-resonant zones in biofield mapping represent areas of high metabolic or energetic activity, often correlating with acute inflammation, high stress, or sympathetic dominance."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "Electrodermal Activity (EDA) measures the skin's electrical conductance. Which physiological mechanism is the primary driver of these changes?",
            "options": [
                "Dermal blood flow and capillary dilation",
                "The activation of eccrine sweat glands by the sympathetic nervous system",
                "The thickness of the stratum corneum in the epidermis",
                "The piezoelectric effect of the skeletal structure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDA is primarily driven by the sympathetic nervous system's activation of eccrine sweat glands, making it a highly sensitive indicator of emotional and energetic arousal."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a high SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) score is statistically associated with which outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of sudden cardiac event",
                "Chronic fatigue syndrome and low mitochondrial output",
                "High adaptive capacity and psychological resilience",
                "A state of 'Energetic Freeze' or dissociation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDNN is a 'gold standard' for HRV; higher values indicate better autonomic balance, greater resilience to stress, and a more robust energetic field."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In Gas Discharge Visualization (GDV) / Bio-Well analysis, what does the 'Entropy' parameter specifically quantify?",
            "options": [
                "The total volume of the energy field in pixels",
                "The degree of disorder or chaotic energy distribution within the system",

                "The percentage of oxygen saturation in the peripheral tissues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entropy in GDV measures the degree of disorder. Higher entropy scores suggest that the energy field is disorganized, even if the total energy volume is high."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "During Advanced Clinical Kinesiology, why is the 'Pre-test' (including hydration and polarity checks) considered mandatory?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the practitioner's energy does not influence the client",
                "To establish a 'Clear Circuit' so the muscle response is neurologically valid",
                "To increase the client's suggestibility before the main assessment",
                "To measure the baseline strength of the deltoid muscle in pounds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Clear Circuit' ensures the nervous system is communicating accurately. Without pre-tests for hydration and switching, the muscle response may yield false positives or negatives."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Quantitative Chakra Assessment uses 'Alignment' and 'Intensity' scores. What is indicated by a high Intensity score (5.0+ Joules) but a low Alignment score (below 70%)?",
            "options": [
                "The chakra is closed and requires immediate stimulation",
                "The client is experiencing a total 'burnout' of the endocrine system",
                "There is significant energy present, but it is displaced or poorly directed",
                "The practitioner has performed the measurement incorrectly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High Intensity with low Alignment suggests the client has plenty of 'fuel' or energy, but it is not centered or integrated properly, often leading to erratic symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "According to the Environmental Energetic Assessment standards (SBM-2015), an AC Magnetic Field reading of 6 mG (600 nT) in a sleeping area is classified as:",

                "Extreme Concern"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In Building Biology standards, AC magnetic fields above 5 mG (500 nT) are considered 'Extreme Concern' (S4) and require immediate mitigation for health and energetic integrity."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Protocol™, what does the 'L' stand for, and what is its primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Localization: Identifying the specific anatomical or energetic origin of the imbalance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Localization (L) follows Assessment (A) and focuses on pinpointing exactly where in the biofield or physical body the primary energetic blockage is residing."

            "question": "A 2022 clinical study cited in the module demonstrated that practitioners using the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Protocol™ saw what percentage increase in 'Client Perceived Efficacy' compared to non-structured assessments?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "28%",
                "42%",
                "67%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data indicates that structured synthesis protocols like B.A.L.A.N.C.E. increase perceived efficacy by approximately 42% due to the clarity and repeatability of the assessment process."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client's Bio-Well scan shows high stress (6.5) and low energy (35 Joules), while their HRV shows low HF (High Frequency) power. What is the most likely energetic priority?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive chakra clearing and stimulation",
                "Parasympathetic activation and environmental stabilization",
                "High-intensity bioresonance frequency therapy",
                "Heavy metal detoxification through muscle testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low energy combined with high stress and low HF (vagal tone) indicates a depleted system in 'survival mode.' The priority is calming the nervous system (parasympathetic) and removing environmental stressors before adding more 'work' to the system."
