            "question": "In Advanced Biofield Mapping, how is a 'Miasm' distinguished from a 'Micro-Tear'?",
            "options": [
                "A Miasm is a structural breach in the outer aura, while a Micro-Tear is an internal energy blockage.",
                "A Miasm is a dense, inherited or acquired energetic distortion held in the blueprint, whereas a Micro-Tear is a localized leak in the auric boundary.",
                "Miasms only occur in the physical body, while Micro-Tears are strictly found in the Causal layer.",
                "There is no clinical distinction; both terms refer to the same energetic phenomenon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Miasms are deep-seated energetic imprints (often transgenerational) that distort the field's frequency, whereas Micro-Tears are literal 'holes' or ruptures in the auric layers that lead to vitality leakage."
