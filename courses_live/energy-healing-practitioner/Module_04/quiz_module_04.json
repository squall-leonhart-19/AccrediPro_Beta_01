            "question": "According to the principles of the piezoelectric effect discussed in Lesson 1, what occurs when mechanical or energetic pressure is applied to the collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix?",
            "options": [
                "The collagen fibers dissolve into liquid crystalline states",
                "The tissue generates an electrical charge that facilitates cellular signaling",
                "The fibers become inert to prevent further damage",
                "The tissue releases cortisol to manage the stressor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The piezoelectric effect describes the ability of certain materials, including collagen in the human body, to generate an electrical charge in response to applied mechanical or energetic stress, which is a foundational mechanism for energetic healing."

            "question": "In William Tiller's 'Intention-Host Device' experiments (Lesson 2), human intention was shown to be capable of altering the pH of water by what significant margin?",
            "options": [
                "0.01 pH units",
                "0.10 pH units",
                "Up to 1.0 pH unit",
                "pH levels cannot be altered by intention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tiller's research demonstrated that focused human intention could change the pH of water by as much as 1.0 full unit, suggesting that human consciousness can influence the physical properties of matter."

            "question": "When applying frequency matching for tissue repair (Lesson 3), which frequency is scientifically associated with the stimulation of osteoblast activity and bone healing?",
            "options": [

                "528 Hz"
            ],

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological marker used to measure Vagal Tone and the body's shift into a parasympathetic healing state?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose Levels",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the 'gold standard' for measuring vagal tone; a higher HRV indicates a robust parasympathetic response and greater physiological resilience."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Fritz-Albert Popp's research into biophotons (Lesson 5) revealed that healthy cells emit light in a 'coherent' state. What is the defining characteristic of this emission?",
            "options": [
                "Random bursts of high-intensity light",
                "Highly ordered, laser-like light that facilitates rapid cellular communication",

                "Heat-based infrared radiation only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biophoton coherence refers to the highly ordered, laser-like emission of light from DNA, which Popp argued allows for near-instantaneous communication between cells."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "During the induction of Heart-Brain Coherence (Lesson 6), what specific rhythmic frequency does the heart typically settle into?",

                "10.0 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart-Brain Coherence is characterized by a sine-wave-like heart rhythm pattern occurring at a frequency of approximately 0.1 Hz (6 cycles per minute)."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "In the hands-on protocol for 'Healing Induction' (Lesson 7), why is a non-contact 'sweeping' motion often used before localized hand placement?",
            "options": [
                "To cool the practitioner's hands",
                "To physically push toxins out of the skin",
                "To clear 'energetic noise' and static from the biofield",
                "To increase the friction of the air molecules"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sweeping the biofield helps clear energetic 'noise' or static, preparing the client's field to receive more focused, localized energetic frequencies."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A practitioner measures a client's HRV before and after a session. A 20% increase in the 'Root Mean Square of Successive Differences' (RMSSD) indicates which outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased sympathetic 'fight or flight' activation",
                "A decrease in cellular biophoton emission",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An increase in RMSSD (a common HRV metric) specifically reflects increased parasympathetic activity, indicating the client has shifted into a healing/restorative state."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "According to the 'Observer Effect' in healing (Lesson 2), how does a practitioner avoid 'locking in' a client's pathology?",
            "options": [
                "By ignoring the client's symptoms entirely",
                "By maintaining a state of 'quantum superposition' and focusing on the desired healthy state",
                "By focusing intensely on the diseased tissue to 'burn' it away",
                "By asking the client to describe their pain in detail for the duration of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By focusing on the potential for health rather than the 'reality' of the disease, the practitioner avoids collapsing the wave function into the pathological state, allowing for a new, healthy outcome to manifest."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key requirement for achieving 'Biological Entrainment' between a practitioner and a client?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner must have a higher blood pressure than the client",
                "Both individuals must be in a state of sympathetic dominance",
                "The practitioner must first achieve a state of internal coherence",
                "The practitioner must use physical force to manipulate the client's rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment occurs when the stronger, more coherent field (the practitioner's) influences the less coherent field (the client's). Therefore, the practitioner must establish their own coherence first."
