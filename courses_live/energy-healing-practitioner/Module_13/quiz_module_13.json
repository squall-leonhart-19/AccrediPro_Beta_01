            "question": "According to the Quantum Foundations of biofield assessment (L1), how does the 'Observer Effect' specifically impact the practitioner's diagnostic process?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures that the client's energy field remains static and unaffected by the practitioner's presence.",
                "The act of focused observation collapses the wave function, potentially influencing the energetic state being measured.",
                "It requires the use of specialized electronic equipment to bypass the practitioner's consciousness.",
                "It suggests that energy cannot be measured without a physical medium like blood or lymph."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In quantum physics, the observer effect highlights that the act of observation influences the phenomenon being observed. In biofield assessment, the practitioner's consciousness and intent can interact with the client's quantum field, collapsing the wave function into a specific state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The heart produces the most powerful rhythmic electromagnetic field in the body. Its magnetic component is approximately 5,000 times stronger than the brain's magnetic field and can be detected several feet away from the body."

                "Vision enhancement genes (RHO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research has shown that intensive energy and mind-body practice can lead to the downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes like RIPK2 and COX-2, demonstrating how the biofield influences epigenetic expression and cellular recovery."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Du Mai or Governing Vessel is referred to as the 'Sea of Yang.' It governs all the Yang meridians and is primary in the activation and circulation of Wei Qi (protective energy) throughout the biofield."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Schumann Resonance is the Earth's 'heartbeat' frequency, measured at 7.83 Hz. Entraining a client's biofield to this frequency is a core strategy in advanced environmental purification and grounding."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "According to Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) principles in Lesson 7, how does chronic energetic 'congestion' in the emotional body typically manifest in the physical immune system?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of T-cells indefinitely",
                "By creating a state of chronic sympathetic dominance, leading to suppressed Secretory IgA levels",
                "By immediately neutralizing all viral pathogens",
                "By shifting the body's pH to a highly alkaline state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PNI shows that emotional/energetic stress triggers the HPA axis, maintaining sympathetic dominance. This leads to the suppression of Secretory IgA, the first line of defense in the immune system, making the client more susceptible to illness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainable Sovereignty moves away from practitioner-dependency. The goal is to educate and empower the client to recognize and manage their own energetic state, ensuring long-term health beyond the treatment room."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic 'brain fog' and a feeling of being 'unplugged' from their body. Based on Lesson 3 (Advanced Harmonics), which minor vortexes should be assessed for grounding and integration?",
            "options": [
                "The Palmar vortexes",
                "The Foot vortexes and the Earth Star chakra",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Foot vortexes and the Earth Star chakra (located below the feet) are the primary anchors for the biofield. Inefficiency in these areas often results in lack of grounding, 'brain fog,' and a sense of dissociation."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "When neutralizing cellular memory blocks (L4), the 'Neutral Point' technique requires the practitioner to hold which energetic stance?",
            "options": [
                "Active manipulation of the client's tissue",
                "A state of 'Equanimity' or 'Zero-Point' awareness, acting as a non-judgmental witness",

                "Rapid rhythmic breathing to force energy through the block"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neutralizing cellular memory requires the practitioner to enter a 'Zero-Point' or neutral state. This non-judgmental witnessing allows the stored energetic charge to release without the practitioner adding further 'noise' or resistance to the field."
