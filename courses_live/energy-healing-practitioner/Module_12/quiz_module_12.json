                "Cords are always beneficial, while hooks are always harmful",
                "Cords represent a two-way exchange of energy, while hooks are one-way parasitic attachments",
                "Hooks are found in the chakras, whereas cords only exist in the limbs",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable in the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Protocol™"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cords are relational energetic structures involving a reciprocal exchange, whereas hooks are unilateral attempts by an external source to draw energy from the client."

                "Energy healing becomes toxic if practiced longer than 15 minutes",
                "To ensure neuroplasticity through consistent compliance rather than occasional intensity",
                "Because the biofield resets every 15 minutes automatically",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency is the primary driver of biofield restructuring; shorter, manageable sessions ensure higher compliance rates and gradual, stable neuro-energetic changes."
