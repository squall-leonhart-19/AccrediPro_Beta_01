            "question": "During Advanced Biofield Mapping, a frequency variance 'dip' below 4.5 Hz in the emotional layer (second layer) of the aura typically indicates which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Acute inflammatory response",
                "Chronic energetic depletion or suppressed emotional trauma",
                "A state of high spiritual connectivity",
                "Normal physiological resonance for a resting state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In biofield mapping, frequencies below the 5-8 Hz range in the emotional layer are statistically correlated with 'congestion' or 'depletion,' often signaling long-held emotional suppression or chronic fatigue."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of Somatic Resonance, a client presenting with chronic thyroid dysfunction and difficulty with self-expression is demonstrating a resonance mismatch in which chakra-glandular link?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance links physical symptoms in the neck and thyroid to the Throat Chakra (Vishuddha), which governs communication and authentic self-expression."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In the context of Quantum Entanglement in healing, what does the 'Observer Effect' imply for the practitioner-client relationship?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner must remain completely detached to avoid influencing the outcome.",
                "The practitioner's focused intention collapses the wave function of potential outcomes into a physical reality.",
                "Healing only occurs if the client is consciously watching the practitioner.",
                "Entanglement is impossible if the practitioner and client are in different rooms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quantum physics suggests that the act of observation (intention) influences the behavior of subatomic particles, implying the practitioner's focused intent plays a role in manifesting healing outcomes."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Based on Chronobiology and the Chinese Organ Clock, a session scheduled between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM is most effective for addressing which energetic system?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM window is the peak time for the Kidney meridian, making it the optimal time for sessions focused on deep vitality, fear release, and adrenal support."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which neurological pathway is primarily responsible for the 'Activate Healing' stage, characterized by a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is the primary mediator of the 'social engagement system' and the relaxation response, which is essential for the body to enter a state where energetic healing can be integrated."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In the study of Energy Field Psychodynamics, Reichian 'Emotional Armor' in the Diaphragmatic Segment is most likely to manifest energetically as:",
            "options": [
                "A total lack of boundaries in the auric field",
                "A constriction or 'knotting' of energy at the solar plexus, inhibiting the flow between upper and lower chakras",
                "Excessive energy leakage at the crown",
                "Over-activity in the root chakra"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The diaphragmatic segment acts as a physical and energetic barrier; when armored, it prevents the fluid movement of energy between the emotional/creative centers and the heart/higher centers."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A 2023 clinical study cited in the course found that chronic cortisol elevation leads to which specific biofield deformity?",

                "Complete disappearance of the heart chakra resonance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels are associated with a loss of biofield integrity, specifically thinning of the protective outer layers, making the client more susceptible to environmental stressors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which ethical concept describes the phenomenon where a practitioner unconsciously projected their own unresolved emotional needs onto the client during an energetic entrainment?",
            "options": [
                "Informed Consent",
                "Transference",
                "Countertransference",
                "Energetic Sovereignty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their feelings or needs onto the client, which is a critical boundary violation in professional energy healing."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Client 'Case Study A' presents with high evening cortisol, insomnia, and a 'fragmented' solar plexus. According to the Integrative Protocols, what is the first priority?",

                "Distance healing only to avoid energetic contamination"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When cortisol is high and the biofield is fragmented, the priority is stabilization and down-regulation of the nervous system (HPA axis) through grounding, rather than further stimulation."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "During the 'Activate Healing' stage, brainwave monitoring typically shows an increase in which frequency, facilitating deep energetic restructuring?",
            "options": [
                "High Beta (20-30 Hz)",
                "Gamma (above 35 Hz)",
                "Theta (4-8 Hz)",
                "Alpha (8-12 Hz) only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta waves (4-8 Hz) are associated with deep meditation, the subconscious mind, and the state where profound neuroplastic and energetic shifts occur."
