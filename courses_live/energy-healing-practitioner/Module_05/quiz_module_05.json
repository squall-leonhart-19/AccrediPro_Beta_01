            "question": "According to the 'Science of Stagnation' (Lesson 1), what biophysical phenomenon occurs when bio-photons become trapped in a specific area of the bio-field?",
            "options": [
                "Increased coherent light emission",
                "A localized increase in entropy and reduction in signal coherence",
                "Spontaneous cellular regeneration",
                "An increase in the piezoelectric voltage of the bone structure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stagnation is characterized by a loss of coherence. Instead of light (bio-photons) flowing through the field, it becomes 'scattered,' leading to high entropy and a lack of communication between cells."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "During the 'Mapping Resistance' process (Lesson 2), a practitioner identifies a 'rebound' sensation or 'energetic push-back.' This is most likely indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "An energetic void or depletion",
                "A healthy, flowing meridian",
                "An active defensive block or acute resistance",
                "A complete lack of bio-field activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'rebound' or 'push-back' feeling during scanning indicates an active resistance where the client's field is pushing away external influence to protect a perceived vulnerability."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Secondary Gain.' Which of the following is the best example of a secondary gain that might prevent a client from neutralizing an energetic block?",
            "options": [
                "The client's desire to feel vibrant and healthy",
                "A subconscious fear that healing will result in a loss of financial support or attention from others",
                "The physical pain associated with the blockage site",
                "The use of 528Hz frequencies during a session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the hidden benefits (e.g., sympathy, avoidance of responsibility, or financial support) that a client subconsciously receives from remaining 'stuck' or ill."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "417 Hz is the frequency associated with neutralizing negative influences and 'clearing the path' for change by undoing stagnant patterns."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights the Psoas muscle as the 'Muscle of the Soul.' What is the primary indicator that a somatic release is successfully neutralizing a block in this area?",
            "options": [
                "Sudden muscle paralysis",
                "Neurogenic tremors (involuntary shaking)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurogenic tremors are a natural nervous system response that indicates the discharge of stored 'fight or flight' energy from the fascia and Psoas muscle."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In the context of Breathwork Strategies (Lesson 6), how does 'Respiratory Alkalosis'—often induced by rapid breathing—affect the neutralization process?",
            "options": [
                "It strengthens the ego's defenses",
                "It lowers the pH of the blood to increase oxygenation",
                "It temporarily bypasses the analytical mind to access the subconscious",
                "It prevents the release of bio-photons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapid, rhythmic breathing can shift the blood's pH (alkalosis), which temporarily quietens the prefrontal cortex, allowing the practitioner to work directly with subconscious energetic blocks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the work so the client's nervous system can integrate the release without becoming overwhelmed or re-traumatized."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Stillpoint' is a therapeutic pause where the body's rhythms momentarily stop as the system reorganizes itself after a block has been neutralized."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most effective and safe approach is to combine frequency-based tools with trauma-informed somatic release to address both the energetic and physical components of the block."
