            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Biofield Resilience' protocol emphasizes the 3rd layer of the aura (the Mental Body). What is the primary indicator of a 'permeable' boundary in this specific layer?",
            "options": [
                "Physical joint pain and inflammation",
                "Chronic fatigue and adrenal exhaustion",
                "Difficulty distinguishing one's own thoughts from the emotional climate of a room",
                "A sudden loss of spiritual connection or 'dark night of the soul'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A breach in the 3rd layer (Mental Body) typically manifests as cognitive enmeshment, where the practitioner or client absorbs the mental energy and thought forms of others, leading to confusion and loss of mental autonomy."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the neuro-energetic data presented in Lesson 2, balancing the Solar Plexus and Heart chakras has been shown to improve Heart Rate Variability (HRV) by what average margin?",
            "options": [
                "5-12%",
                "18-25%",
                "35-40%",
                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical observations and meta-analyses cited in the lesson indicate that targeted energetic work on the Solar Plexus and Heart synergy can increase parasympathetic tone and HRV by 35-40% in stressed populations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In Energetic Psychosomatics (Lesson 3), chronic tension and energetic stagnation in the 'Rhomboid-Trapezius Complex' is most frequently mapped to which emotional state?",
            "options": [
                "Repressed creative expression and vocal inhibition",
                "The 'Weight of the World' syndrome—carrying excessive responsibility for others",

                "Unresolved childhood trauma related to the father figure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychosomatic mapping shows that the upper back and shoulders are the primary storage sites for 'over-responsibility' and the emotional burden of carrying others' needs at the expense of one's own."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When applying the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. protocol non-locally (Lesson 4), which phase is critical for establishing the 'Quantum Entanglement' necessary for distance work?",
            "options": [
                "B - Boundary Setting",
                "A - Attunement and Resonance",
                "L - Linkage and Transfer",
                "E - Evaluation of Biofield"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement is the phase where the practitioner matches the frequency of the client's energetic signature, creating the non-local 'bridge' required for effective distance healing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "For a client presenting with 'Chronic Depletion' (Lesson 5), why does the Lifeforce Restoration Protocol advise against heavy clearing of the upper chakras in the first session?",
            "options": [
                "It can cause the client to fall asleep too quickly",
                "It may further drain the already low 'Kidney Jing' or Root energy",
                "Upper chakras are not affected by chronic fatigue",
                "It interferes with the practitioner's own energetic protection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of severe depletion, clearing (which is subtractive) can be further destabilizing. The protocol prioritizes 'filling' the lower reservoirs (Root/Dantian) before attempting to clear upper blockages."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Advanced Chakra Synergies.' Which 'Harmonic Triad' is used specifically to facilitate 'Spiritual-Material Integration'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Root (Physical), Heart (Bridge), and Crown (Spiritual) triad creates a vertical alignment that helps the client manifest spiritual insights into physical reality."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Under the 'Professional Ethics and Energetic Contract' (Lesson 7), what is the primary risk of failing to 'close' the energetic contract at the end of a session?",
            "options": [
                "The client will refuse to pay for the session",
                "The practitioner may experience 'Residual Linkage,' leading to vicarious exhaustion",
                "The healing effects will immediately dissipate",
                "The practitioner will lose their certification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An open energetic contract allows for continued, unconscious energy exchange (Residual Linkage), which is a leading cause of practitioner burnout and empathic distress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "The Rapid Response B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Sequence (Lesson 8) is optimized for 'Energetic Shocks.' What is the first step in this mastery-level sequence?",

                "Scanning the entire auric field for tears",
                "Immediate grounding and 'Root-Lock' visualization",

                "Performing a full 7-chakra realignment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute shock, the energy body often 'shatters' upward or outward. Immediate grounding is required to bring the client's consciousness back into the physical container."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Michael' (Lesson 2), who suffered from Sympathetic Nervous System dominance, which energetic intervention led to a 22% reduction in cortisol levels?",

                "Aggressive Heart Chakra expansion",
                "Sedating the Solar Plexus while simultaneously grounding the Root",

                "Clearing the Throat chakra of suppressed anger"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study demonstrated that sedating the overactive Solar Plexus (the seat of the 'fight or flight' response) while grounding the Root effectively down-regulated the HPA axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Non-Local Anchor' used in the Distance Healing Mechanics of Lesson 4 to ensure the practitioner does not use their own personal lifeforce?",
            "options": [
                "A physical photograph of the client",
                "The 'Source-to-Earth' conduit method",
                "Visualizing the client sitting in the room",
                "Repeating the client's name three times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Source-to-Earth' conduit method ensures the practitioner acts as a hollow bone or channel, drawing energy from universal sources rather than depleting their own biofield."
