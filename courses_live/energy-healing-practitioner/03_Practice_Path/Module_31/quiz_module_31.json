            "question": "What is the primary objective of branding the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Protocol™ rather than just marketing 'Energy Healing'?",
            "options": [
                "To charge higher prices for a trademarked name",
                "To create a unique category of one and move away from commoditization",
                "To satisfy legal requirements for practice registration",
                "To hide the spiritual nature of the work from skeptical clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Branding a proprietary protocol like B.A.L.A.N.C.E. creates a 'category of one,' differentiating the practitioner from the general market of 'energy healers' and positioning them as a specialist with a unique methodology."

                "We focus on biofield harmonization to enhance overall well-being."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must avoid 'disease claims.' Claiming to 'cure' or 'treat' specific clinical diagnoses like depression or anxiety triggers FDA/FTC oversight and legal risk."

            "id": "q31_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule ensures you build significant authority and trust through education before asking for a sale, which is critical in high-trust industries like energy healing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MOFU is the consideration stage. This is where you use case studies, webinars, or deep-dive content to convert 'aware' leads into 'interested' prospects."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Successful partnerships are based on 'The Complementary Gap.' By showing how your protocol improves their results (e.g., reducing patient stress so medical treatments work better), you create a win-win referral bridge."

                "It shifts the client's focus from 'cost per hour' to the 'value of the transformation'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "They started running expensive TV advertisements",
                "They stopped using social media entirely",
