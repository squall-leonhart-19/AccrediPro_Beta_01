            "question": "According to the research of Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary characteristic of biophoton emission in healthy versus diseased cells?",
            "options": [
                "Healthy cells emit high-intensity, chaotic light, while diseased cells emit low-intensity light.",
                "Healthy cells emit highly coherent, laser-like light, while diseased cells show diminished coherence and randomized patterns.",
                "Diseased cells emit 50% more biophotons than healthy cells due to metabolic stress.",
                "There is no measurable difference in biophoton emission; the difference is purely in the frequency of the aura."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Popp's research established that biological systems emit 'coherent' light. Healthy cells function like a stable laser, while disease is characterized by a loss of this coherence and a breakdown in the communication field."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In the 'Highway of Light' (Lesson 2), which Nadi is associated with the parasympathetic nervous system, cooling energy, and the 'Lunar' flow?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ida Nadi terminates at the left nostril and is associated with the moon, cooling energy, and the parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 describes Breathwork as the 'Ignition Switch.' What is the physiological mechanism by which rhythmic breathing influences the 'Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Pump'?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases blood pressure to allow energy to sink into the root chakra.",
                "It creates pressure changes in the thoracic and abdominal cavities that facilitate the upward flow of CSF toward the brain.",
                "It oxygenates the blood to a level of 100% saturation, which triggers biophoton bursts.",
                "It temporarily halts the heartbeat to allow for energetic stillness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep, rhythmic breathing acts as a mechanical pump for the CSF, which carries neurotransmitters and ions, physically supporting the upward movement of energy (Lifeforce) through the central channel."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "HeartMath Institute research cited in Lesson 4 shows that 'Heart Coherence' occurs at a specific resonant frequency. What is this frequency?",

                "528 Hz"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The resonant frequency of the human heart-brain system during states of coherence is approximately 0.1 Hz, which aligns the autonomic nervous system and maximizes electromagnetic output."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, which Solfeggio frequency is specifically highlighted for its purported ability to facilitate 'Transformation and DNA Repair'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "528 Hz is known as the 'Miracle' tone and is widely used in energy medicine for transformation, DNA repair, and increasing vitality."

            "question": "When performing 'Manual Induction' (Lesson 6), what is the primary purpose of the 'Oscillating Palm' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To physically massage the client's muscle tissue.",
                "To create a piezoelectric charge in the practitioner's hands to stimulate the client's biofield.",
                "To block incoming negative energy from the client's environment.",
                "To measure the client's blood pressure through the aura."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oscillating the palms creates a rapid change in the electromagnetic field (induction), which generates a piezoelectric-like effect that 'wakes up' or activates the client's dormant lifeforce."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Leaky Aura Syndrome' (Lesson 7). Which symptom is most indicative of this condition based on the module's data?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leaky Aura Syndrome is characterized by a porous biofield that fails to protect the individual from external stressors, leading to rapid depletion and 'picking up' others' emotions."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Within the BALANCE Protocol™ (Lesson 8), why must 'Lifeforce Activation' (L) occur after 'Alignment' (A)?",
            "options": [
                "Because activation is the easiest step and should be saved for the end.",
                "To ensure the 'pipes' (meridians/nadis) are clear and aligned before increasing the 'voltage' of the energy flow.",
                "Because activation requires the client to be asleep.",
                "The order does not actually matter in the BALANCE Protocol™."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Activating energy in a misaligned or blocked system can cause discomfort or 'energetic indigestion.' Alignment ensures the pathways are ready to handle the increased flow of lifeforce."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart-focused breathing combined with a positive emotional state (appreciation/gratitude) is the scientifically validated method to move the heart into a coherent 0.1 Hz rhythm."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Golden Ratio' of breath timing suggested in Lesson 3 to trigger the transition from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic state during activation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extending the exhale to be twice as long as the inhale (2:1 ratio) stimulates the Vagus nerve, signaling the nervous system to shift into a calm, receptive state suitable for energy work."
