            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Proximal stressors are internal subjective processes, such as internalized stigma or concealment, whereas distal stressors are external objective events like discrimination or violence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The GCLS is a psychometric tool designed to evaluate how well a client's physical appearance and social role align with their internal gender identity, which is critical for transition-related coaching."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A 2019 study on LGBTQ+ resilience found that 'Community Connectedness' can buffer the effects of minority stress. Which assessment tool is most appropriate for measuring this specific metric?",

                "To determine which identity is 'most' marginalized for reporting purposes",
                "To understand how overlapping identities (e.g., Race and LGBTQ+ status) create unique stressors or resilience factors",
                "To advise the client on which identity they should prioritize in the workplace",
                "To replace the need for psychological screening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality mapping allows coaches to see the full picture of a client's life, acknowledging that a Black trans woman faces different systemic stressors than a white cisgender gay man."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize clinical boundaries. A PHQ-9 score of 15+ indicates moderate-to-severe depression, which requires clinical intervention beyond the scope of coaching."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is used in Lesson 7 to track progress. If a client sets a goal for 'Social Transition' and achieves a 'Much more than expected' outcome, what score is typically assigned in the GAS framework?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In GAS, 0 represents the expected outcome, +1 is 'more than expected,' and +2 is 'much more than expected.' This allows for the quantification of subjective coaching goals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding that Identity Pride is a statistically significant resilience factor allows coaches to intentionally integrate pride-affirming interventions into the coaching plan."
