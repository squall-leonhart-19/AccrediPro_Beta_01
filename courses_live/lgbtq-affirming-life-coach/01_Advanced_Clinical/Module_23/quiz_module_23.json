            "question": "In the context of Somatic Integration (L1), how does 'Neuroception' specifically impact LGBTQ+ clients living with chronic minority stress?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the client to consciously choose their emotional response to discrimination.",
                "It describes the subconscious scanning for environmental threats, often keeping the client in a state of hyper-arousal or dorsal vagal shutdown.",
                "It is a cognitive technique used to re-label physical sensations of anxiety as 'excitement'.",
                "It refers to the process of medically transitioning the nervous system through hormonal therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the nervous system's 'bottom-up' process of scanning for safety or danger. For LGBTQ+ clients, chronic minority stress often results in a biased neuroception that perceives threat even in neutral environments, necessitating somatic grounding."

            "question": "When applying Advanced Narrative Re-Authoring (L2), what is the primary goal of 'Externalizing the Problem'?",
            "options": [
                "To encourage the client to blame society for all their personal failings.",
                "To help the client visualize their gender dysphoria as an internal organ that can be removed.",
                "To separate the client's identity from the problem (e.g., 'The Shame' vs. 'I am shameful'), reducing self-stigma.",
                "To document the client's history for legal name change purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalization is a core narrative technique that shifts the focus from 'the person is the problem' to 'the problem is the problem,' allowing the client to develop a more agency-focused relationship with their challenges."

            "question": "A 2022 study cited in Lesson 3 found that Cognitive Schema Restructuring targeting 'Internalized Transphobia' resulted in what significant physiological change?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in resting heart rate variability (HRV), indicating improved emotional regulation.",

                "Complete elimination of the startle response in social situations.",
                "An immediate increase in prefrontal cortex density after one session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that restructuring negative core schemas (e.g., 'I am inherently broken') correlates with improved Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which is a physiological marker of a more resilient and regulated nervous system."

                "The final stage of surgical recovery.",
                "A state of 'betwixt and between' where old identities are shed but new ones are not yet fully integrated, requiring meaning-making.",
                "The clinical term for the period before a client comes out to their family.",
                "The rejection of all gendered labels in favor of a nihilistic worldview."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liminality is the existential 'threshold' space. In transition, this can be a period of high anxiety but also profound creative potential for the client to define their own essence."

                "To ask the client to find the 'logical' reason why their body is wrong.",
                "To encourage the client to notice where the dysphoria is felt in the body and what its 'texture' or 'temperature' is without judgment.",
                "To perform a cross-examination of the client's childhood memories.",
                "To distract the client from their physical sensations using vigorous exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Investigation in RAIN is about somatic curiosity. By noticing the physical qualities of dysphoria, the client can de-identify with the intense emotion and view it as a passing physical phenomenon."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micro-affirmations are small, everyday acts of inclusion. Using correct pronouns in the client's absence validates their identity systemically and sets a standard for the environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Expansion modalities move away from 'either/or' thinking and support the client in embracing a 'both/and' or 'neither/nor' framework, which is essential for fluid and non-binary identities."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Spiritually Affirming Practices, what distinguishes 'Spiritual Bypass' from genuine 'Spiritual Integration'?",
            "options": [
                "Bypass uses spiritual beliefs to avoid dealing with psychological pain or identity trauma; Integration weaves identity and faith together.",
                "Bypass is only done by religious people, while Integration is for atheists.",
                "Integration requires the client to join a specific affirming church; Bypass is solitary.",
                "There is no difference; both terms refer to the same process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Spiritual bypassing involves using 'enlightenment' or 'forgiveness' to suppress the very real pain of LGBTQ+ trauma. Integration allows the client to honor their identity and their spiritual needs concurrently."

            "id": "q23_9",

                "Reframing the freeze response as a 'choice' the client is making."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orienting is a foundational somatic technique. By visually engaging with the environment and identifying neutral objects, the client signals to the nervous system that there is no immediate physical predator, helping to exit the freeze state."

            "id": "q23_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sparkling moments are exceptions to the dominant 'problem story.' By focusing on these, the coach and client can build a 'preferred story' of resilience, agency, and authentic identity."
