            "question": "In small LGBTQ+ 'Gayborhoods,' dual relationships are often unavoidable. According to the lesson on Advanced Boundaries, what is the most ethical approach when a coach and client realize they attend the same small social group?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the coaching relationship to avoid any conflict of interest.",
                "Discuss the overlap transparently and create a 'Social Encounter Agreement' regarding confidentiality in public.",
                "Ignore the overlap and pretend not to know the client when in public spaces.",
                "Ask the client to find a different social group to maintain professional distance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In tight-knit communities, 'incidental encounters' are common. The ethical mandate is transparency and collaborative boundary-setting through a pre-planned agreement on how to handle public interactions."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A client is experiencing an 'Intersectional Identity Conflict' between their deeply held religious beliefs and their coming-out process. What is the coach's ethical mandate?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the client to leave the religious organization to achieve self-actualization.",
                "Provide theological arguments that prove their religion is actually affirming.",
                "Maintain 'Affirmative Neutrality,' supporting the client's agency to navigate both identities without the coach imposing a preferred outcome.",
                "Refer the client to a secular therapist as religious conflicts are outside the scope of coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical management of intersectionality requires supporting the client's self-determination and 'holding space' for conflicting identities without the coach steering the client toward one specific resolution."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "When considering Privacy and the Risk of Outing, which of the following represents a common 'administrative outing' risk identified in Module 22?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Administrative outing occurs when the coach's branding or communications (like a labeled envelope or credit card statement) reveals the client's involvement with an LGBTQ+ service to family or housemates before the client is ready."

            "id": "q22_4",

                "The client's tendency to look up the coach's personal life on social media.",
                "The coach's impulse to search for a client's social media profile to 'get more context' on their life.",
                "The speed at which information spreads in the digital LGBTQ+ community.",
                "The use of search engines to find LGBTQ-affirming resources for clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Google Reflex' is the unethical or boundary-blurring habit of coaches searching for client information online without the client's consent, which violates the client's right to control their own narrative."

                "Humility is for beginners, while competence is for advanced practitioners.",
                "Competence implies a 'finish line' of knowledge, while Humility is a lifelong process of self-critique and power-balancing.",
                "Humility focuses on the coach's feelings, while competence focuses on the client's culture.",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms in the ethics code."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility acknowledges that one can never be fully 'competent' in another's lived experience; it mandates ongoing self-reflection and the active dismantling of the power imbalance between coach and client."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A client reveals during a session that they are experiencing 'flashbacks' and 'dissociation' related to past conversion efforts. What is the ethical 'Scope of Practice' action for the coach?",

                "Use trauma-informed coaching techniques to help the client process the flashbacks.",
                "Ask the client to focus only on the future and ignore the past symptoms.",
                "Refer the client to a trauma-specialist therapist while potentially continuing coaching for future-oriented goals only.",
                "Immediately terminate all contact as the client is now a 'clinical' case."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize 'clinical red flags' like dissociation and flashbacks. The ethical response is a referral to a licensed mental health professional, though coaching can sometimes continue concurrently if roles are clearly defined."

        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "In 'Affirmative Transference,' a client might view the coach as an 'Idealized Queer Elder.' Why is this a power dynamic concern?",
            "options": [
                "Because it makes the coach feel too much pressure to be perfect.",
                "Because the client may bypass their own values to seek the coach's approval, hindering self-actualization.",
                "Because it is a sign that the coaching is working exceptionally well.",
                "Because the coach should be the one looking up to the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client idealizes the coach, they may adopt the coach's values or decisions rather than developing their own autonomy, which is the ultimate goal of affirming coaching."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in the module found that LGBTQ+ clients are 3x more likely to experience 'micro-invalidations' in professional settings. What is an ethical way to counter this in coaching?",

                "By promising the client that the world will become more accepting soon.",
                "By practicing 'Active Validation' and acknowledging the reality of systemic oppression during sessions.",
                "By focusing only on 'positive vibes' to help the client forget about the invalidations.",
                "By telling the client they are being too sensitive to social cues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical coaching requires acknowledging the client's external reality (systemic oppression) rather than gaslighting them or focusing solely on internal mindset changes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "What is the ethical stance on 'Political Neutrality' when a coach's client is directly impacted by anti-LGBTQ+ legislation?",
            "options": [
                "The coach must remain strictly neutral and never discuss politics.",
                "The coach should use the session to recruit the client for political activism.",
                "The coach acknowledges the impact of the legislation on the client's wellbeing while keeping the focus on the client's personal coping and agency.",
                "The coach should express their own political anger to show the client they are on the same side."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'blank slate' neutrality is often impossible, the coach's role is to support the client's response to political stress rather than using the session for the coach's own political venting or recruitment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "If a coach receives a 'friend request' on a personal social media account from a current client, what is the most ethical response according to the Digital Presence guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Accept the request to build rapport and show the client they are 'part of the community.'",
                "Decline the request and explain the 'Digital Boundary Policy' during the next session.",
                "Ignore the request and never mention it, hoping the client forgets.",
                "Block the client immediately to protect the coach's privacy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Declining the request while explaining the boundary (ideally already stated in the informed consent) protects the professional nature of the relationship and prevents the blurring of roles."
