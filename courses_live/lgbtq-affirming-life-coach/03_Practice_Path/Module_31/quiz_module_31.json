            "id": "q31_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Queer Market Landscape' is described as fragmented. Why is targeting the entire LGBTQ+ acronym as a single niche often ineffective for a new coach?",
            "options": [
                "The community is too small to support a generalist approach.",
                "It ignores the distinct psychographics, trauma histories, and specific needs of subgroups (e.g., trans-masculine professionals vs. elder lesbians).",
                "Most LGBTQ+ individuals prefer mainstream coaches over specialized ones.",
                "Marketing platforms like Meta do not allow targeting based on sexual orientation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective niche identification requires moving beyond the 'monolith' myth. Each subgroup within the LGBTQ+ community has unique pain points, cultural nuances, and language that require specific, tailored messaging."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on 'Visual Semiotics,' what is the primary benefit of using 'Subtle Signaling' (like specific color palettes or historical queer symbols) over standard rainbow branding?",
            "options": [
                "It is cheaper to produce and easier to design.",
                "It helps avoid 'Rainbow Washing' accusations and signals a deeper cultural competency to 'in-group' members.",
                "It is the only way to bypass censorship on social media platforms.",
                "It ensures that cisgender/heterosexual allies do not accidentally book sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visual semiotics allows a coach to communicate safety and belonging to the queer community through nuanced symbols (e.g., lavender, violets, or specific flag-adjacent palettes) that demonstrate deep cultural awareness beyond performative marketing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 introduces the concept of 'Educational Safety' in content strategy. What does this entail?",
            "options": [
                "Providing free resources so clients don't have to pay for coaching.",
                "Requiring clients to pass a quiz before they can book a discovery call.",
                "Creating content that validates the client's identity while explaining the coaching process, reducing the 'vulnerability gap' before the first call.",
                "Ensuring all content is peer-reviewed by at least three other LGBTQ+ coaches."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Educational safety is about lowering the barrier to entry by using content to demystify the coaching experience, establish the coach's affirming stance, and reduce the anxiety often felt by marginalized clients entering a new professional relationship."

        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "When optimizing for 'Queer-Specific Search' (Lesson 4), why are long-tail keywords like 'affirming life coach for neurodivergent trans youth' more valuable than broad terms like 'life coach'?",
            "options": [
                "They have higher search volume and more competition.",
                "They signal higher 'Search Intent' and attract clients who are specifically looking for the intersectional expertise you provide.",
                "Google's algorithm prioritizes longer sentences over short phrases.",
                "Long-tail keywords are the only ones that work for voice-activated search like Siri."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-tail keywords reflect the specific, intersectional needs of the queer community. While they have lower volume, the conversion rate is significantly higher because the searcher is looking for a very specific type of support."

            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Referral Ecosystems.' What is the 'Vetting Protocol' essential for an affirming coach when referring a client to an outside specialist?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the specialist offers a 20% kickback for every referral.",
                "Verifying that the specialist has at least 10 years of experience.",
                "Confirming the specialist has undergone specific LGBTQ+ competency training and has a proven track record of affirming care.",
                "Only referring to other coaches within the AccrediPro network."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a trauma-informed referral ecosystem, the coach is responsible for ensuring the 'warm handoff' is to a provider who will not re-traumatize the client. Vetting for affirming practices is an ethical imperative."

        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "In the 'Trauma-Informed Enrollment Process' (Lesson 6), what is the purpose of the '48-Hour Cool-Off' rule?",
            "options": [
                "To give the coach time to decide if they actually want the client.",
                "To prevent 'Fawn' responses where a client agrees to a high-cost program out of a perceived need to please the coach during the call.",
                "To allow the coach's billing department to run a credit check.",
                "To increase the 'scarcity' of the coaching offer by making the client wait."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many queer individuals have a trauma-informed 'fawn' response to authority figures. Encouraging a cool-off period ensures the client's 'yes' is a grounded, somatic 'yes' rather than a survival-based compliance response."

            "id": "q31_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 warns against 'Agitation Marketing' in paid advertising. What is the ethical alternative for an LGBTQ+ affirming coach?",
            "options": [
                "Aspiration-based marketing that focuses on the 'Desired State' and the possibility of queer joy.",
                "Using 'Fear of Missing Out' (FOMO) to encourage quick sign-ups.",
                "Targeting people who have recently searched for 'depression' or 'anxiety'.",
                "Running ads that highlight the high suicide rates in the community to show the need for coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Agitation marketing triggers minority stress and cortisol. Ethical marketing for the queer community should focus on liberation, resilience, and the 'Desired State,' moving toward 'Queer Joy' rather than exploiting pain."

            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on 'Scaling & Sustainability,' what is a 'Hybrid Accessibility Model'?",

                "A business structure that uses high-ticket 1:1 coaching to subsidize low-cost or pro-bono community programs and group sessions.",
                "A coach who works both in-person and online.",
                "A model that uses both Facebook and Instagram for advertising."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability in the queer market often requires balancing profit with community care. A hybrid model allows the coach to remain financially viable while ensuring their services remain accessible to those with fewer financial resources."

            "id": "q31_9",

                "Offers the lowest price in the market.",
                "Demonstrates year-round commitment to the community through content and social action.",
                "Uses celebrity influencers in their advertisements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Authenticity is the highest currency in the queer market. Consumers are highly attuned to 'performative allyship' and prefer brands/coaches who show consistent, year-round engagement."

            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "During a trauma-informed discovery call, if a client begins to 'over-share' traumatic details, what is the coach's ethical responsibility according to Lesson 6?",

                "To listen to everything to better understand the client's needs.",
                "To gently interrupt and 'contain' the session, reminding the client that the call is for assessing fit, not for processing deep trauma yet.",
                "To immediately end the call and refer them to a therapist.",
                "To start the coaching session immediately to address the trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed enrollment involves 'containing' the space. Allowing a client to over-share before a container (the coaching agreement) is established can lead to a 'vulnerability hangover' and prevent the client from moving forward."
