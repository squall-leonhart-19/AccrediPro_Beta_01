            "question": "Research such as the 2020 study by Warrier et al. suggests that autistic individuals are significantly more likely to identify as gender diverse than neurotypical individuals. What is the approximate increased likelihood found in large-scale data?",

                "1.5 to 2 times more likely",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses and large-scale studies (n > 600,000) have consistently found that neurodivergent individuals, particularly those on the autism spectrum, are 3 to 6 times more likely to be gender diverse than the general population."

            "question": "When coaching LGBTQ+ elders, the 'Silent Generation' (born 1925-1945) often presents with specific psychological barriers. Which concept describes the lifelong impact of living through eras where their identities were classified as mental illnesses and criminal acts?",

                "Hyper-vigilance and the 'Closet' as a survival mechanism",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many LGBTQ+ elders, the 'closet' was a necessary tool for survival against systemic pathologization and criminalization, often resulting in deeply ingrained hyper-vigilance even in affirming spaces."

                "The problem is the lack of resilience in the disabled client.",
                "The problem is the societal failure to provide adequate services and inclusive environments.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Social Model of Disability posits that people are disabled by barriers in society (such as physical environment or attitudes) rather than by their physical or mental impairments."

            "explanation": "Deconstruction in a coaching context is the non-judgmental process of helping a client systematically examine their belief systems to determine what is authentic to them and what was coerced or inherited."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In small communities, the 'Social Encounter Agreement' is an ethical tool used to discuss boundaries beforehand, ensuring the client's privacy is protected and the coach's role remains clear during incidental public contact."
