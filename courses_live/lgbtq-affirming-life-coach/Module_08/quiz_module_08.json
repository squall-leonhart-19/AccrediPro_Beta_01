                "By focusing primarily on the identity that causes the most immediate distress",
                "By treating each identity as a separate 'pillar' of coaching to be addressed in different sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality is not additive; it describes how overlapping identities create a unique, unified experience of marginalization that is different from the sum of its parts."
