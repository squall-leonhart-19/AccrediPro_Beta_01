            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is the cumulative physiological wear and tear resulting from chronic over-activation of the stress response (Minority Stress), which can lead to long-term health disparities in LGBTQ+ populations."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Positionality refers to the social and political context that creates one's identity. In reflexive practice, the coach must understand how their own positionality impacts the power they hold over the client and how they interpret the client's story."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "explanation": "The Matrix of Domination explains that power and oppression are organized through structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, and interpersonal domains, all of which a Master Practitioner must be able to synthesize."

            "question": "Case Study: A Black trans woman client reports feeling 'numb and disconnected' during sessions. Using Somatic Integration (L3), the coach recognizes this as a 'Dorsal Vagal' state. What is the most appropriate first step?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Polyvagal Theory, the Dorsal Vagal state is one of shutdown/immobilization. A Master Practitioner utilizes co-regulation and grounding to bring the client back to 'Ventral Vagal' (social engagement/safety) to allow for productive coaching."
