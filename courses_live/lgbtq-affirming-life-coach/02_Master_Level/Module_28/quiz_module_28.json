            "question": "When performing an advanced suicide risk assessment (L1), which approach is considered the gold standard for gathering accurate information?",
            "options": [
                "Using euphemisms like 'hurting yourself' to avoid triggering the client",
                "Direct, explicit inquiry about suicidal ideation, intent, and means",
                "Relying solely on standardized written intake forms",
                "Waiting for the client to bring up the topic of self-harm first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that direct inquiry does not increase suicidal ideation and is the most effective way to assess risk. Using explicit language ensures there is no ambiguity in the client's response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Threatening to disclose a partner's sexual orientation or gender identity ('outing') is a unique power-and-control tactic in LGBTQ+ relationships that leverages systemic homophobia or transphobia."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those from Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago, show that LGBTQ+ youth have a 120% higher risk of reporting homelessness compared to youth who identify as heterosexual and cisgender."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Harm reduction focuses on minimizing the negative consequences of drug use. Supporting the client in safety planning (e.g., Naloxone, supervised use) meets the client where they are and prioritizes immediate survival."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within their scope of practice. While they can provide emotional support and help with resource navigation or logistical planning, they cannot provide medical or legal advice."

            "options": [
                "Minority stress acts as a 'buffer' that makes clients more resilient to trauma",
                "Chronic exposure to distal stressors (discrimination) and proximal stressors (internalized transphobia) creates a state of 'perpetual hypervigilance'",
                "Minority stress is a one-time event that does not contribute to complex trauma",
                "C-PTSD only occurs from physical abuse, not from systemic discrimination"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "C-PTSD in LGBTQ+ individuals is often the result of prolonged, repetitive stress. Minority stress theory explains how constant environmental hostility leads to the hypervigilance and emotional dysregulation seen in C-PTSD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary victimization occurs when the victim suffers further harm through the institutional response to the crime, often due to bias or lack of trauma-informed care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active intent, specific plans, or psychotic symptoms (like command hallucinations) are clinical red flags that exceed the scope of life coaching and require immediate psychiatric or emergency intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A warm handoff involves the coach actively facilitating the transition to a higher level of care, which increases the likelihood that the client will actually follow through with the referral."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety plans should prioritize internal coping strategies (distraction, relaxation) as the first line of defense. 'No-suicide contracts' are outdated and clinically ineffective compared to collaborative safety planning."
