I need to tell you something before the holiday rush takes over.

<strong>I'm making you an offer I rarely make.</strong>

For the next 3 days only (through December 26th), you can enroll in the full Functional Medicine Practitioner Certification for <strong>$997</strong>.

That's the complete certification. All 21 modules. The same training that's helping practitioners like Diane earn $8,000/month from home, and Maria build a $12,000/month practice.

<strong>But here's why I'm telling you NOW:</strong>

This isn't just about a discount. It's about timing.

Think about what January will look like. The "new year, new me" energy. Everyone setting goals they'll abandon by February.

<strong>What if you walked into 2025 with something real already in motion?</strong>

Not a vague resolution. Not a "someday" dream. But actual certification in progress. Skills you're building. A new career path that's already started.

That's what I want for you this Christmas.

<strong>Here's what you get:</strong>

- Full 21-module certification program
- Lifetime access to all materials
- Private community of practitioners
- Done-for-you client acquisition systems
- 30-day money-back guarantee

<strong>And if you enroll by December 26th:</strong>

- Priority placement in our January mentor cohort
- Exclusive "Launch Your Practice" bonus workshop
- 2 private coaching calls with a certified mentor

This is my gift to you, {{firstName}}. A chance to make 2025 the year everything changes.

Enroll now: [LINK]

The offer expires midnight December 26th. Don't wait until January to wish you'd started now.

Merry Christmas,

Sarah

P.S. I started my own transformation during the holidays. There's something magical about giving yourself permission to grow. This could be your moment.`,

Merry Christmas.

I hope today is filled with people you love and moments that matter.

But I also want to share something personal. Because Christmas is about more than presents - it's about hope. And possibility.

<strong>A few years ago, on a Christmas morning just like this one...</strong>

I was exhausted. Burned out. Pretending to be merry while secretly wondering: "Is this it? Is this what my life will always look like?"

I remember looking at my daughter opening presents and thinking: "I want to be there for her. Really there. Not the tired, stressed version of me that barely has anything left to give."

<strong>That was the Christmas I decided to change.</strong>

Not in January. Not "someday." Right then.

I gave myself permission to invest in a different future. I started my training. I began building something that would eventually set me free.

<strong>Best Christmas gift I ever gave myself.</strong>

{{firstName}}, if you're reading this today wondering about your own path - your own "what if?" - I want you to know:

<strong>It's not too late. It's not too early. This might be exactly the right moment.</strong>

The Christmas offer is still open through tomorrow (December 26th at midnight):

- Full $997 certification
- All bonuses included
- Priority January mentor placement

[ENROLL NOW]

Whatever you decide, I hope this Christmas plants a seed. Of hope. Of possibility. Of what could be.

You deserve that.

Warmly,

Sarah

P.S. Some of our most successful practitioners enrolled during the holidays. There's something about this time of year that makes people ready for real change. Are you ready?`,

This is it. Final call.

<strong>The Christmas certification offer expires tonight at midnight.</strong>

If you've been thinking about this - considering it - wondering if 2025 could be different... this is your moment to decide.

<strong>Here's what you're looking at:</strong>

<strong>OPTION A: Let this pass</strong>
→ January comes. Life gets busy. The "someday" stays someday.
→ December 2025 arrives and you're in the same place.
→ Another year of wondering "what if?"

<strong>OPTION B: Take the leap</strong>
→ Start 2025 with momentum already building.
→ Join the January mentor cohort (priority placement ends tonight).
→ By December 2025, you could be certified, practicing, earning.

<strong>Same amount of time will pass either way.</strong>

The only question is where you'll be when it does.

<strong>What's included (tonight only):</strong>

✓ Full 21-module certification ($997)
✓ Lifetime access to all materials
✓ Private practitioner community
✓ Done-for-you client acquisition systems
✓ January priority mentor placement (BONUS)
✓ "Launch Your Practice" workshop (BONUS)
✓ 2 private coaching calls (BONUS)
✓ 30-day money-back guarantee

<strong>ENROLL BEFORE MIDNIGHT: [LINK]</strong>

After midnight, the bonuses disappear. The priority placement closes. The next opportunity won't look like this one.

{{firstName}}, I've done everything I can to make this easy. The rest is up to you.

<strong>Make 2025 the year you look back on and say: "That's when everything changed."</strong>

It starts with one decision. Tonight.

Still believing in you,

Sarah

P.S. If you're on the fence and have questions - ANY questions - reply right now. I'm monitoring my inbox tonight and will answer personally. No pressure. Just clarity.`,

// Strategy: "New Year, New Career" - new beginnings, fresh start

    // Email 1 - Dec 30: Resolution with teeth
    {
        order: 0,
        subject: "Re: your 2025 resolution (with teeth)",

Let me guess.

You've made New Year's resolutions before. "This year I'll..." 

And by February? Gone.

<strong>I want to propose something different for 2025.</strong>

Not a resolution. A decision. One that has structure. Support. A real path forward.

Because here's what I've learned about change:

<strong>Vague goals die fast. Specific plans survive.</strong>

"I want to be healthier" = resolution that fades.
"I'm enrolling in certification that starts January 15th" = decision with teeth.

<strong>What if 2025 was the year you actually became a certified practitioner?</strong>

Not "explored the idea." Not "read about it." Actually did it.

Here's why right now matters:

- <strong>January mentor cohort</strong> starts in 2 weeks
- <strong>New Year enrollment</strong> closes January 2nd
- <strong>Full certification</strong> is $997 (with all bonuses)
- <strong>First clients</strong> could happen as early as March

By this time next year, you could be:
→ Certified and practicing
→ Earning $3,000-$8,000/month
→ Helping people who desperately need what you offer
→ Living a completely different life

<strong>Or you could be making the same resolution you made this year.</strong>

Your choice.

[ENROLL FOR 2025 →]

Let's make this resolution one that actually sticks.

Sarah

P.S. I made my big career decision right before a new year. Best timing possible. You start fresh with everyone else - but with actual momentum.`,

<strong>Happy New Year! 🎉</strong>

I hope you're waking up today with hope. With possibility. With that magical feeling that anything could happen.

<strong>Before the day gets busy, I want to ask you one question:</strong>

What do you want December 31st, 2025 to look like?

Really picture it. One year from today.

Are you in the same job? Same routine? Same Sunday night dread?

Or are you somewhere different?

<strong>Here's what I wish for you:</strong>

I wish that by this time next year, you're:
- Certified in something that matters
- Helping people transform their health
- Earning real money from work you actually believe in
- Looking back at this moment as the turning point

<strong>That's what the practitioners in our community experienced.</strong>

Maria enrolled last January. By December, she was earning $12,000/month.

Diane enrolled during the holidays. By summer, she'd replaced her nursing income.

Kelly enrolled with zero business experience. By fall, she had a waitlist.

<strong>Their 2024 story could be your 2025 story.</strong>

The New Year enrollment is open through tomorrow (January 2nd):

✓ Full certification - $997
✓ January mentor cohort - Priority access
✓ All launch bonuses included
✓ 30-day guarantee (if it's not right, full refund)

[START YOUR 2025 →]

{{firstName}}, this is the year. I can feel it.

Let's make something amazing happen.

Happy New Year,

Sarah

P.S. The January cohort is filling faster than expected. If you're ready, don't wait until tomorrow. Start 2025 with action, not intention.`,

<strong>The New Year enrollment closes tonight at midnight.</strong>

Two days into 2025, and you have a choice to make.

<strong>Let me be direct:</strong>

Every email I've sent you has been building to this moment. The stories I've shared. The questions I've asked. The possibilities I've outlined.

It all comes down to what you do in the next few hours.

<strong>Here's what I know about you:</strong>

You didn't read this far by accident. You didn't stay on this list because you're not interested. Something in you resonates with this path.

<strong>The question is: Will you act on it?</strong>

<strong>What you get (tonight only):</strong>

- Full 21-module certification ($997)
- January mentor cohort access
- Lifetime materials access
- Done-for-you client systems
- Practice launch workshop
- 2 private coaching calls
- 30-day money-back guarantee

<strong>What you get if you don't enroll:</strong>

- The same 2025 you were already going to have
- Another year of "maybe next time"
- December 31st looking a lot like today

<strong>I'm not trying to pressure you.</strong> I'm trying to make you see what I see:

You're ready for this. You just need to decide you're ready.

[FINAL ENROLLMENT →]

After midnight, the bonuses go away. The January cohort closes. And the next opportunity won't look like this one.

<strong>Make 2025 count, {{firstName}}.</strong>

It starts with one click. One decision. One leap.

I'll be watching for your name.

Sarah

P.S. If you enroll tonight, I'll personally send you a welcome message. First step on a very different path. I hope to see you.`,
