Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my health coaching practice while still working part-time, raising kids. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
- Full ASI Certification
- Done-For-You materials (website, forms, meal plan templates)
- Weekly group calls with me
- Private community access
- Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Karen...

Karen joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago.

Her situation:
- 48 years old
- Pre-diabetic diagnosis at 45
- Lost and regained 30+ pounds multiple times
- Exhausted from yo-yo dieting
- Terrified she wasn't "qualified enough"

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started helping 3 neighbors for free
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 4 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 12 hours/week
Month 8: $4,400/month with regular referrals, quit her part-time job

Karen didn't have special qualifications. She followed the system.

She:
Used the done-for-you templates
Showed up to weekly calls
Asked questions when stuck
Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed a nutrition degree. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Karen used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful health coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
- Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
- Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
- Wednesday: Content + meal prep planning (1.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
- Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a flexible health coaching practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
- 30 min morning while coffee brews (before anyone needs you)
- 30 min during lunch break
- 1 hour while kids are at practice
- Weekend morning batch for meal plans and content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that actually transforms lives?"

TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "coaching business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

Another year of unfulfilling work
Staying stuck in a job that drains you
Watching other women help clients transform
Same frustration next year, same "someday"

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

- 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
- 2 clients = investment covered + profit
- 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your career with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week jumpstart. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help women get healthy!!" - Karen, 48
---

Karen started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
- "What if I'm not qualified?"
- "What if they don't lose weight?"
- "What if they already know what I know?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my gym friend connection!" - Donna, 52

"Finally told my family about my coaching practice. They're so supportive!" - Linda, 49

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 2 people this week." - Melissa, 54

These aren't special women with nutrition degrees.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
- Get certified in 30 days
- Use done-for-you materials immediately
- Weekly calls to ask questions
- Community of 200+ women supporting you
- Meal plan templates that work
- 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
- Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
- Figure it out alone
- Make mistakes others have already solved
- Delay your coaching career by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Health Coaching Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: CHECK-IN
Start with connection. Ask how they're feeling.
"How was your week? What wins do you want to celebrate?"

5-15 min: PROGRESS REVIEW
"What worked this week? What was challenging?"
"How's your energy been on a scale of 1-10?"
Look at their food log or habit tracker together.

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
- Blood sugar balance
- Meal prep strategies
- Stress eating triggers
- Sleep habits

Guide them to their own insights. Ask questions more than giving advice.

40-50 min: ACTION PLAN
"What's ONE thing you'll focus on this week?"
Make it specific and measurable.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Celebrate their commitment. Confirm next session.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to guide them ONE step forward.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

    // Day 16
    {
        day: 16, gap: "five-pillar", sarah: `Hey {firstName}!

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Pillars Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY client? Use the 5 Pillars of metabolic health.

PILLAR 1: BLOOD SUGAR BALANCE
- Energy crashes mid-afternoon?
- Cravings after meals?
- Hangry between meals?

PILLAR 2: QUALITY NUTRITION
- Eating enough protein?
- Vegetables at most meals?
- Processed food frequency?

PILLAR 3: RESTORATIVE MOVEMENT
- Daily movement habits?
- Strength training?
- Overdoing cardio and undereating?

PILLAR 4: SLEEP OPTIMIZATION
- Hours per night?
- Quality of sleep?
- Waking rested or exhausted?

PILLAR 5: STRESS RESILIENCE
- Chronic stress symptoms?
- Stress eating patterns?
- Recovery practices?

Score each pillar 1-10. The LOWEST pillar is where you start.

Example: Client scores Blood Sugar 4, Nutrition 6, Movement 7, Sleep 5, Stress 3
-> Start with STRESS. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Pillars assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

        day: 17, gap: "signature-program", sarah: `Morning {firstName}!

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

SINGLE SESSIONS:
- Client comes once, tries something, falls off
- You're constantly chasing new clients
- No deep transformation = no testimonials
- Income is unpredictable

PACKAGES:
- Multiple touchpoints = real habit change
- Built-in accountability
- You become their health partner
- Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
- Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK JUMPSTART:

Week 1: Discovery + Blood Sugar Reset
Week 2: Nutrition Foundation + Meal Prep
Week 3: Movement + Energy Optimization
Week 4: Habit Stacking + Maintenance Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something compelling:
- "The Energy Reset Jumpstart"
- "4-Week Metabolism Makeover"
- "The Sustainable Weight Loss Program"
- "The Midlife Health Transformation"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 4 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to say that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

YOU CANNOT:
- Diagnose medical conditions
- Prescribe diets for specific diseases
- Tell someone to stop their medications
- Claim to "cure" anything
- Replace doctors or dietitians

YOU CAN:
- Guide general healthy eating habits
- Help with meal planning and prep
- Coach on lifestyle changes
- Support with habit formation
- Teach about blood sugar basics
- Recommend they see a doctor if needed
- Share your own health journey

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If this sounds like a medical issue, I encourage you to also speak with your doctor about it."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as professional.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You have insulin resistance"
Say: "Some of what you're describing - the cravings, the afternoon crashes - sounds like it could be worth discussing with your doctor. In the meantime, let's focus on balanced meals that help stabilize energy."

TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "speak with your doctor" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Can You Actually Help Me?"

Every client might say some version of this:
"I've tried everything"
"Nothing works for me"
"My metabolism is just broken"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE VALIDATION
"I hear you. You've tried SO many things and it hasn't worked. That's exhausting. What we do is different because we focus on sustainable habits, not quick fixes. Let me share how..."

SCRIPT 2: THE REFRAME
"Everything you've tried has taught you something about what DOESN'T work for your body. Now let's figure out what does. Most diets fail because they're not personalized - we build something that fits YOUR life."

SCRIPT 3: THE EVIDENCE
"I get it. I was skeptical too after years of yo-yo dieting. What changed for me was understanding blood sugar and habits instead of just calories. Let me show you the approach..."

NEVER SAY:
"You just didn't try hard enough"
"This time will be different"
"Just trust me"

Position yourself as PARTNER not expert. You're figuring this out TOGETHER.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}!

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE woman in your life who's struggling with her energy or weight? I'd love to help her like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them results first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (recipe book, journal, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been working on your health. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro -> Easy conversation.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
- First access when doors open
- Exclusive scholarship consideration
- Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
- No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in health coaching, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring health coaches:
- "What if they don't lose weight?"
- "What if I fail publicly?"
- "What if my family thinks I'm being silly?"
- "What if I'm not qualified enough?"
- "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
- "What if the diet industry has already ruined my credibility?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if they don't lose weight?"
Worst case: Client doesn't get results, I learn from it
What I'd do: Adjust my approach, maybe that client wasn't a good fit
Cost of fear winning: Another year stuck in unfulfilling work, not helping anyone

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of trying.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
