TODAY'S LESSON: Your Pet Story Is Your Greatest Gift

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a veterinary degree. You don't need 10 years of animal science training. You don't need to be a nutrition expert.

Your STORY - your pet's health struggles, your journey to better nutrition, your transformation - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about pet nutrition in a textbook... or someone who actually LIVED through watching their pet suffer and found the answer?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "heartbreak" becomes your MISSION.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 pet nutrition struggles you've experienced. These become your "I understand your fur baby" stories.

📎 Download: "Pet Parent Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE DOG PARK FRIEND - The pet parent always asking about your dog's shiny coat

2️⃣ THE FACEBOOK PET GROUP MEMBER - Someone who's seen you post about nutrition

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S PET - Your sister's dog with allergies, your neighbor's picky eater

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know [pet's name] has been struggling with [issue]. I'm building my pet nutrition practice and looking for 3 fur babies to help. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation about their nutrition?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Pet Expertise Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I know more"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't follow the feeding plan
❌ FREE clients don't track their pet's progress
❌ FREE clients don't see transformation
❌ FREE clients make you resent your calling

✅ PAYING clients are invested in their fur baby
✅ PAYING clients follow the plan
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials
✅ PAYING clients refer other pet parents

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION to their pet's nutrition.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Nutrition Assessment: $97-$150
• 4-Week Nutrition Transformation: $297-$397
• 3-Month Pet Wellness Program: $697-$997

Pet parents spend $500+ on vet visits for issues nutrition could prevent. Your guidance is VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. PET INTAKE FORM - Pet's history, current diet, health issues, vet info

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a veterinarian. This is nutrition guidance, not medical diagnosis or treatment."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You provide nutrition education, NOT diagnose conditions or prescribe medications

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"For any health concerns, please consult with your veterinarian. I work alongside your vet to optimize your pet's nutrition."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Pet Nutrition Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Tech for Non-Techy Pet Lovers

Your ENTIRE tech stack to start:

📅 CALENDLY (free) - Pet parents book themselves
💳 STRIPE/PAYPAL (free) - Get paid online
📝 GOOGLE DOCS (free) - Pet intake forms, feeding plans
📱 ZOOM (free) - Video consultations

THAT'S IT. 4 free tools.

You can run a $3k/month pet nutrition practice with these.

BONUS TIP: Create a shared folder for each client's pet photos and progress pics. Pet parents LOVE seeing their fur baby's transformation documented.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Set up Calendly. Add 2-3 consultation slots. Takes 10 minutes.

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Pet Parent Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for dog owners, cat lovers, breed-specific communities
📌 At dog parks, pet stores, training classes
📌 Looking for someone who GETS their pet parent struggles

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK GROUPS - Join pet parent groups. Share valuable tips. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every pet you help, the owner tells 5 other pet parents
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Partner with groomers, pet stores, training facilities
4️⃣ DOG PARK CONNECTIONS - 2 genuine pet parent convos/week

No algorithms. No hashtags. Just genuine pet parent connections.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for pet parents. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to give pet nutrition advice?"
"What if I don't know enough about every pet food?"
"I'm not a veterinarian"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to know everything. You need to know MORE THAN THE PET PARENT.

🔥 Your PASSION for pets is your gift. Clients don't want a scientist - they want someone who LOVES animals.

🔥 Your pet's story is your qualification. You've LIVED through the confusion.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance on pet nutrition from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know about pet nutrition now that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
