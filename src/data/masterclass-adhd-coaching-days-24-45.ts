TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Another ADHD Hyperfocus

You know a LOT now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find ADHD clients
• How to price
• How to run coaching sessions
• How to get referrals
• What to say, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

(And I know our ADHD brains can learn FOREVER without acting!)

Information → Implementation = Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD (ADHD-Friendly!):

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE person about your ADHD coaching
• Set up Calendly (15 minute timer!)
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about your journey
• Complete your intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence. Momentum beats overthinking.

Stop learning. Start DOING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works - especially for ADHD!

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 months. After they have ANY breakthrough.
• "I finally used the body doubling technique and finished my taxes!"
• "I actually showed up to all my appointments this week!"
• "My relationship with my spouse is SO much better!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's so amazing! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], I struggled with [specific ADHD challenge]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason - usually that you GET ADHD]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook posts and ADHD groups
• Discovery call prep ("Read what my clients say...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE with ADHD (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

        day: 26, gap: "website", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Website (30 Minutes Max!)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help (women with ADHD)
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

Set a 30-minute timer. No ADHD hyperfocus rabbit holes allowed!

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help women with ADHD finally understand and work WITH their beautiful brains"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"Diagnosed at 42 after years of feeling broken, I now help other late-diagnosed women..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week ADHD Brain Reset - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes from clients
Even if informal. Even if from free clients.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Create your 1-page website. Use the template. 30 MINUTE TIMER. Go!

    {
        day: 27, gap: "boundaries", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Boundaries With ADHD Clients

As you help more people, you'll encounter:
• "Can I text you anytime I'm spiraling?"
• "I know we're done but just one more ADHD question..."
• "Can we do a call at 10pm? That's when my brain works!"
• "I need you to be available whenever I hyperfocus"

Setting boundaries isn't mean. It's ESSENTIAL - especially because YOU have ADHD too!

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to messages within 24-48 hours. For mental health emergencies, please contact a crisis line or your therapist."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold coaching sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-3pm. This helps both our ADHD brains have structure!"

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on ADHD life strategies and executive function. For clinical mental health needs, I'll connect you with appropriate support."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I batch my messages once per day to protect my own ADHD brain. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for ADHD Coaches (Yes, We Can Do This!)

You have ADHD. Your clients have ADHD. Time is... weird for all of us.

Here's how to make it work:

THE BATCH METHOD (ADHD-Friendly!):

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting for ADHD), batch similar tasks:

• CLIENT DAYS: Stack all your sessions on 2 days (momentum!)
• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon, create a week's worth of posts (hyperfocus mode)
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, scheduling, invoicing all at once (body doubling helps!)

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your ADHD coaching:
• Your peak brain time (whenever that is for YOU)
• Set alarms 15 mins before, 5 mins before, AT the time
• Use visual timers during work blocks

THE 80/20 RULE FOR ADHD:

20% of your activities create 80% of results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, coaching sessions, referral asks
Low ROI: Scrolling ADHD Reddit, "researching," reorganizing files for the 10th time

Do MORE of the 20%. Ignore the rest (I know, hard for our brains!).

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week. SET ALARMS.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating this as a HOBBY or a CALLING?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

HOBBY:
• Help friends and family for free
• No pressure to get clients
• Learn at your own pace
• Maybe make some side income eventually

CALLING:
• Building an actual ADHD coaching practice
• Helping women understand their neurodivergent brains
• Getting paying clients
• Replacing or supplementing your income
• Doing this for REAL

Both are valid.

But only one leads to the life you're actually yearning for.

If you're choosing CALLING...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself. Which are you choosing?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating this as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find ADHD clients (support groups, referrals, local talks)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 programs)
✅ You know how to run sessions (D.E.P.T.H. Method structure)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, disclaimers)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to market (ADHD communities, word of mouth)
✅ You know how to handle imposter syndrome
✅ You know your scope of practice
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonials

You have EVERYTHING you need...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for ADHD coaching:

🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification provides documentation of your training and competence

💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified ADHD Coach" vs "someone who has ADHD and gives advice"

🧠 CREDIBILITY WITH DOCTORS: Psychiatrists and therapists refer to CERTIFIED coaches

👥 CLIENT TRUST: Parents of ADHD kids and adults with ADHD choose certified coaches

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified ADHD coaches charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have experiences.
With the credential, you have a PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our ADHD coach graduates are actually doing.

Melissa started 10 months ago. She now makes $4,600/month.
Karen started 7 months ago. She makes $2,900/month.
Linda started 5 months ago. She just hit $1,800/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are.

The difference? They saw the math and made the decision (despite their ADHD brains wanting to research more!).

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 ADHD clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Melissa - From "Broken" School Counselor to $4,600/Month ADHD Coach

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Melissa joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 47 years old, School counselor for 15 years
• Diagnosed with ADHD at 42
• Lost 3 jobs before understanding why
• Felt "fundamentally broken"

THE TURNING POINT:
• Finally understood her ADHD wasn't a flaw
• Realized "I can help other women avoid years of struggle"
• "If I'd been diagnosed earlier... if someone had coached me..."

NOW (10 months later):
• $4,600/month income (part-time, 18 hours/week)
• 14 active ADHD coaching clients
• Waitlist of 6 more
• Left traditional counseling 8 months ago
• "I finally feel like my scattered brain is an ASSET, not a liability."

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 40 years thinking something was wrong with me. My ADHD brain isn't broken - it's different. And now I help other women see that too. Don't wait. Your ADHD is your superpower once you learn to use it."

Melissa is real. Her results are real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference (Especially for ADHD!)

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started...

You can have all the knowledge in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone. And ADHD brains need accountability more than anyone!

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - pricing, clients, ADHD struggles
• Real-time feedback and guidance
• ACCOUNTABILITY (essential for ADHD!)

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Session templates for ADHD clients
• Intake forms designed for neurodivergent coaching
• Email scripts
• Social media posts
• All ADHD-specific (no generic coaching stuff)

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified ADHD coaches
• Share wins and challenges
• Accountability partners with ADHD brains
• Referral network

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me
• Personalized guidance
• Help when you're stuck (we all get stuck!)

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT and ACCOUNTABILITY.

I tried to do this alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got a mentor, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with your #1 question or struggle right now. I'll help you.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping You

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR (Plus the ADHD-Specific Ones!):

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
$297 is ONE client. If you can't find ONE ADHD client with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my graduates. They have ADHD! They found 5-10 hours/week. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY.

😰 "I'M NOT READY"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Melissa wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting.

🧠 "MY ADHD MAKES ME TOO UNRELIABLE"
That's the lie you've been told. Your ADHD makes you RELATABLE. Systems handle the rest.

🤔 "WHAT IF I FAIL?"
What if you succeed? What if this is your purpose? The only guaranteed failure is ignoring your calling.

Which one is YOUR objection?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with YOUR #1 concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it later. (And I KNOW how ADHD time blindness works!)

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you.

The women making $3K-$6K/month didn't have "more organized" ADHD brains. They DECIDED and ACTED when the window was open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

SET AN ALARM. Your ADHD brain will thank you.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Future Self

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's an ADHD client booking confirmation
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,400 came in this week
• You're sitting in your cozy home office (finally set up YOUR way)
• You just finished a session and your client is in tears - she finally UNDERSTANDS her brain
• You look at your calendar - only working 15 hours this week
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel UNDERSTOOD. You feel like your ADHD is a GIFT.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our ADHD coach graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Melissa was crying after losing her 3rd job.
Now she makes $4,600/month helping women understand their ADHD.

6 months ago, Karen thought her ADHD made her "unemployable."
Now she has 11 clients and a waiting list.

You are 6 months away from a completely different relationship with your ADHD brain.

The question is: Will you take the step?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today?

    // Day 39

        day: 39, gap: "urgency-week", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

6 days left.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of ADHD women:

THE WAIT TRAP (ADHD Edition!):
"I'll do it next month..." (you won't remember)
"After things calm down..." (they never do)
"When my ADHD is more managed..." (it won't be from waiting)
"When I have more money saved..." (one client covers it)

Things never calm down. There's never a perfect time for ADHD brains. The women who wait usually end up stuck in the same cycle a year later, wishing they'd started.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences for your ADHD coaching dreams.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up but forgot" → ADHD strikes again, paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Life got in the way" → Stayed stuck for another year

You've invested 39 days. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days. Set your alarms.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed (with an ADHD brain!)
✅ Skills for running ADHD coaching sessions
✅ Systems for getting ADHD clients
✅ Knowledge for helping people understand their brains
✅ Community of ADHD women supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY ADHD materials. Join weekly calls for accountability. Build your real practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out the rest yourself. Always valid (but hard for ADHD brains alone).

OPTION 3: Wait
Let life get busy. Let ADHD procrastination win. Come back in 6 months when you're "ready." (Most people choose this. Most people stay stuck.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest.

The ADHD women making $3K-$6K/month didn't have "better managed" brains. They DECIDED and ACTED.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage, I almost didn't take the leap. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next month"
• "I need to research more" (classic ADHD!)
• "What if my scattered brain fails publicly?"
• "Who am I to coach ADHD when I can barely manage my own?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became organized.
Not because I had all the answers.
Not because my ADHD was "fixed."

But because I DECIDED that my calling was worth more than my fear.

The graduates making $3,000-$6,000/month aren't superhuman. They're not "less ADHD" than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of training. WITH YOUR ADHD BRAIN. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you do this.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days. WITH AN ADHD BRAIN. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART.

Most ADHD people don't make it past Day 7. The shiny new thing wears off.

Not you.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Career Accelerator.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment despite your ADHD. I know your story (or at least I can feel it). And I believe you have what it takes to help other women understand their beautiful neurodivergent brains.

Soul to ADHD soul: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your scattered brain.

And let's build this together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you have ANY questions, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really feel into it:

Do you believe in your calling to help women with ADHD?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to do this someday."
Not "maybe if my ADHD was more managed."

Do you BELIEVE - deep in your neurodivergent soul - that you can help other ADHD women understand their brains?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain, ADHD-doubtful yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and your purpose is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days. I've seen your commitment DESPITE your ADHD brain telling you to quit.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your calling?

48 hours to decide.
