TODAY'S LESSON: Your Transformation Is Your Qualification

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a medical degree. You don't need 10 years of nutrition training. You don't need to be a fitness model.

Your TRANSFORMATION - your struggle with weight, your exhaustion, your health scare - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about weight loss in a textbook... or someone who actually LIVED through the yo-yo dieting, the exhaustion, the wake-up call - and found their way to lasting change?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "struggle" becomes your SOLUTION.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 health struggles you've overcome. These become your "I understand you" stories.

Download: "Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1. THE GYM FRIEND - The woman who mentioned she's tired of starting over every Monday

2. THE NEIGHBORHOOD FRIEND - Someone who's seen your own transformation and asked what you're doing

3. THE FAMILY FRIEND - Your sister's coworker, daughter's friend who's struggling with energy and weight

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been working on your health. I'm building my coaching practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation about your goals?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing", sarah: `Morning {firstName}!

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Expertise Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I have more certifications"

Here's the TRUTH:
FREE clients don't show up
FREE clients don't follow the plan
FREE clients don't transform
FREE clients make you resent your calling

PAYING clients are invested
PAYING clients do the work
PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
- Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
- Single Session: $97-$150
- 4-Week Jumpstart: $297-$397
- 12-Week Transformation: $997-$1,497

Health coaching is VALUABLE. Charging for it is professional.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}!

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Health background, goals, current habits

2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a doctor or dietitian. This is health and wellness coaching, not medical treatment."

3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You guide lifestyle habits, NOT diagnose or treat medical conditions

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

Downloads in Resources:
- "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
- "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Ideal Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
In Facebook groups for weight loss, perimenopause, healthy recipes
At gyms, yoga studios, walking groups
Looking for someone they TRUST who's been where they are

YOUR MARKETING:
1. FACEBOOK - Join health-focused groups. Add value. No pitching.
2. WORD OF MOUTH - Every person you help tells 3 others
3. LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at churches, libraries, mom groups
4. COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect and listen.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for women focused on health or weight loss. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE!

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to give health advice?"
"What if I'm not qualified enough?"
"I'm not a doctor or dietitian"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

You don't need to know everything. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

Your HUMANITY is your gift. Clients don't want a clinical expert - they want someone REAL who's been there.

Your transformation is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 3 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES -> You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now about health that you wish you knew 3 years ago.

Proud of you,
