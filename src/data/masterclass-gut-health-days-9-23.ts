Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my gut health practice while still dealing with occasional flares, still figuring out my own protocols. If I waited for "fully healed," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (gut protocols, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Diana...

Diana joined the Career Accelerator 7 months ago.

Her situation:
• 51 years old
• Suffered from IBS for 20 years
• Doctors told her it was "just stress"
• Missed her daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner due to symptoms
• Terrified of food and bathroom anxiety

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started helping 3 women from her IBS support group
Month 2: First paying client ($297 gut reset package)
Month 3: 4 more clients through word of mouth (gut problems spread by whisper!)
Month 4: Raised prices to $397, still booking
Month 6: $3,800/month working 15 hours/week
Month 7: $5,100/month with a waitlist, quit her desk job

Diana didn't have a nutrition degree. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you gut protocols
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck on client cases
✅ Didn't overthink - just helped women heal

Her quote: "I thought I needed more certifications. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START helping women like me."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Diana used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💚`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful gut health coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + meal prep education (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a clinic. You're building a gut health practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning routine (while your gut-friendly breakfast digests)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real digestive issues do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that helps women heal?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "gut coaching business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year of just coping with your own gut issues
✗ Watching other women suffer like you did
✗ Knowing you could help but not having the framework
✗ Same bloated, frustrated clients a year from now

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= Less than what most women spend on probiotics and supplements in 2 months
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $297 = 100% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've nearly 5x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your gut health calling with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week gut reset. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help women heal their digestion!!" - Diana, 51
---

Diana started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if I don't know enough about the microbiome?"
• "What if their problems are too complex for me?"
• "What if I can't actually help them heal?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my IBS support group connection!" - Michelle, 48

"Finally told my family about my gut coaching practice. They're so proud!" - Laura, 52

"Raised my prices to $397 and booked 3 people this week." - Karen, 46

These aren't special women with nutrition degrees.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you gut protocols immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Elimination diet templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure out gut protocols alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay helping women heal by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💚

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Gut Health Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: GROUNDING
Open with a calming breath and check-in
"Let's take a moment to settle in... how is your gut feeling today?"

5-15 min: THE SYMPTOM CHECK-IN
"Walk me through your digestion this week"
"Any new foods? Reactions? Breakthroughs?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your gut comfort?"

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Elimination diet progress review
• Food reintroduction planning
• Stress-gut connection work
• Meal timing and eating habits

Guide them through the protocol. Hold supportive space.

40-50 min: NEXT STEPS
"What's your ONE focus for this week?"
Assign specific food diary tasks or protocol adjustments.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Celebrate wins, schedule next session, and affirm their progress.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve their entire microbiome. You need to guide ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Root Causes Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY gut health client? Use the 5 Root Causes of digestive dysfunction.

ROOT CAUSE 1: FOOD SENSITIVITIES
• Which foods trigger symptoms?
• Have they done elimination testing?
• Common culprits identified?

ROOT CAUSE 2: DYSBIOSIS (Bacterial Imbalance)
• History of antibiotics?
• Signs of SIBO or candida?
• Probiotic experience?

ROOT CAUSE 3: LEAKY GUT (Intestinal Permeability)
• Systemic inflammation signs?
• Skin issues, joint pain, brain fog?
• Autoimmune tendencies?

ROOT CAUSE 4: STRESS-GUT CONNECTION
• Stress levels and management?
• Eating while stressed or rushed?
• Nervous system regulation?

ROOT CAUSE 5: DIGESTIVE ENZYME INSUFFICIENCY
• Bloating after meals?
• Undigested food in stool?
• Feeling overly full quickly?

Score each root cause 1-10. The DEEPEST issue is where you start.

Example: Client scores Food 4, Dysbiosis 8, Leaky 5, Stress 7, Enzymes 4
→ Start with DYSBIOSIS. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Root Causes assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Gut Reset Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create digestive transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, feels better, old eating habits return
• You're constantly chasing new bloated clients
• No deep gut healing = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple weeks = real microbiome changes
• Built-in accountability for food diary
• You become their gut healing guide
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK GUT RESET:

Week 1: Discovery + Elimination Start
Week 2: Deep Elimination + Symptom Tracking
Week 3: Reintroduction + Gut Healing Protocols

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to suggest that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose IBS, SIBO, Crohn's, colitis, or any condition
• Prescribe supplements, medications, or treatments
• Tell someone to stop their meds or ignore their doctor
• Claim to "cure" any digestive disease
• Replace gastroenterologists or registered dietitians

✅ YOU CAN:
• Educate on gut health foundations
• Guide elimination diet protocols
• Teach food journaling and symptom tracking
• Discuss stress-gut connection
• Share general nutrition information
• Recommend they see a GI doctor if symptoms warrant
• Share your own gut healing experience

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If your symptoms persist or worsen, I encourage you to also work with a gastroenterologist or registered dietitian."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You have SIBO"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds like it could benefit from testing. Have you considered seeing a functional medicine doctor alongside our coaching?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "I encourage you to also see a GI specialist" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "This Sounds Like a Fad Diet"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Isn't elimination just another diet trend?"
"My doctor says gut health is pseudoscience"
"My husband thinks this is crazy"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE SCIENCE GROUNDING
"I hear you. There's a lot of fad stuff out there. What I do is based on identifying your personal food triggers through systematic elimination and reintroduction - very evidence-based. Many functional medicine doctors use the same approach."

SCRIPT 2: THE EVIDENCE
"The gut-brain connection and microbiome research are now backed by thousands of studies. Harvard, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins all have gut health programs now. This isn't fringe anymore."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"Your skepticism is actually healthy. Let's start with simple food journaling and see what patterns emerge. Data-driven, no weird supplements required."

NEVER SAY:
"You just don't understand gut health"
"Your doctor doesn't know what they're talking about"
"This will cure your IBS"

Position yourself as EVIDENCE-BASED and COLLABORATIVE, not anti-medical.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

    // Day 20
    {
        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Gut Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together on your gut health. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who struggles with bloating, IBS, or digestive issues? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC gut struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them digestive wins first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (gut health tea, probiotic sample, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been dealing with some digestive issues. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation about their gut.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you from becoming a gut health coach.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring gut coaches:
• "What if I give bad dietary advice?"
• "What if I fail publicly with someone's digestion?"
• "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone heal?"
• "What if I make someone's gut worse?"
• "What if my own gut issues come back?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
Worst case: A few people question my credentials
What I'd do: Show them my certification and client results
Cost of fear winning: Another year NOT helping women who are suffering with bloating and IBS like I did

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of someone questioning you.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 gut coaching fears. Do the exercise above.
