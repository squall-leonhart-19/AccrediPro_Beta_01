TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Entertainment

You know a LOT now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find clients
• How to price
• How to run Reiki sessions
• How to get referrals
• What to say, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE person about your practice
• Set up Calendly
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about your journey
• Complete your intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence.

Stop learning. Start DOING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 months. After they have ANY shift.
• "I slept through the night!"
• "I feel so much lighter!"
• "My shoulder pain is gone!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's so amazing! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before Reiki with [you], I felt [stressed/tense/exhausted]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help stressed women find deep peace through Reiki healing"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"After years of burnout, I discovered Reiki..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Stress Reset - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes from clients

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Boundaries With Clients

As you help more people, you'll encounter requests for emergency sessions, late-night texts, endless questions between sessions.

Setting boundaries isn't unspiritual. It's ESSENTIAL for sustainable practice.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION: "I respond within 24-48 hours."
⏰ AVAILABILITY: "Sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-4pm."
💬 SCOPE: "Our work focuses on energy wellness."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

Are you treating this as a HOBBY or a CALLING?

HOBBY: Help friends for free, no pressure, maybe side income
CALLING: Building a real practice, paying clients, doing this for REAL

If you're choosing CALLING... you need skills (✅), systems (✅), knowledge (✅), and CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing).

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

You have EVERYTHING you need... except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for Reiki:
🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification provides documentation
💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified Reiki Specialist" vs "someone who does Reiki"
🙏 GROUNDING: Certification makes your practice feel REAL and structured
👥 CLIENT TRUST: Clients choose certified practitioners
💰 PRICING POWER: Certified practitioners charge 2-3x more

Without the credential, you have gifts.
With the credential, you have a PRACTICE.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

    { day: 45, gap: "graduation", sarah: `🎓 {firstName}... CONGRATULATIONS!

You did it. 45 days. Dozens of lessons. Real skills. Real systems.

YOUR MINI-DIPLOMA CERTIFICATE IS READY.

Download it from your portal → Certificates section.

For Career Accelerator Members: Welcome to the next level! First group call is this Thursday.

For Everyone Else: Everything you learned stays with you. When you're ready to get certified, reach out.

I started where you are. Scared. Uncertain. Wondering if I was "gifted enough."

You ARE enough. You've proven it by showing up for 45 days.

Whatever you decide next - full practice, side practice, or somewhere in between - I'm cheering for you.

With so much love and belief in you,
Sarah 🙏

P.S. - Tag me on social when you post your certificate!`,
