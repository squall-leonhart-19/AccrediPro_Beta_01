        day: 9, gap: "scholarship-urgency", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my nutrition practice while still working my desk job, healing from my own autoimmune issues. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (meal plan templates, intake forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Sophia...

Sophia joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago.

Her situation:
• 50 years old
• Taking 7 medications for autoimmune issues
• Felt 80 years old from chronic fatigue
• Confused by conflicting nutrition advice
• Skeptical anything could help

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started a free anti-inflammatory meal prep demo
Month 2: First paying client ($197 elimination protocol)
Month 3: 4 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 15 hours/week
Month 10: $4,700/month with a waitlist, quit her desk job

Sophia didn't have special gifts. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you meal plan templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed a nutrition degree. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Sophia used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💚`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful nutrition coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + meal planning (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a nutrition practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning health routine (before anyone needs you)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for meal planning content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that actually heals people?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "nutrition business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year of food confusion and inflammation
✗ Staying in work that doesn't align with your healing gifts
✗ Watching other women build nutrition practices
✗ Same frustration next year, same unfulfilled calling

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of supplement spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your food-as-medicine calling with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 6-week anti-inflammatory program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help women heal with food!!" - Sophia, 50
---

Sophia started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
• "What if I don't know enough about nutrition?"
• "What if they don't see results?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my yoga studio connection!" - Donna, 51

"Finally told my family about my nutrition practice. They're so proud of me." - Theresa, 47

"Raised my prices to $350 for elimination protocol and booked 2 people this week." - Carol, 55

These aren't special women with nutrition degrees.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you meal plan templates immediately
• Weekly calls to ask nutrition questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Client session templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure out nutrition frameworks alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your food healing calling by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💚

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Nutrition Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: GROUNDING
Open with a brief check-in
"How has your week been with food?"

5-15 min: THE FOOD JOURNAL REVIEW
"Walk me through what you ate yesterday"
"What time did you have your first meal?"
"How did you feel after each meal?"

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Blood sugar balance
• Anti-inflammatory swaps
• Gut healing foods
• Meal timing
• Hydration optimization

Guide them through the changes. Explain the why.

40-50 min: MEAL PLANNING
"Based on what we discussed, here's your focus for this week..."
Give ONE main focus + 2-3 food swaps.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Questions, next session, and encouragement.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to overhaul their entire diet. You need to guide ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Root Causes Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY nutrition client? Use the 5 Root Causes of nutritional imbalance.

ROOT CAUSE 1: BLOOD SUGAR DYSREGULATION
• Energy crashes after meals?
• Hangry between meals?
• Craving sweets constantly?

ROOT CAUSE 2: GUT DYSFUNCTION
• Bloating after eating?
• Irregular digestion?
• Food sensitivities increasing?

ROOT CAUSE 3: CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
• Joint pain or stiffness?
• Skin issues (eczema, acne)?
• Brain fog and fatigue?

ROOT CAUSE 4: NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES
• Hair loss or brittle nails?
• Low energy despite good sleep?
• Mood swings or anxiety?

ROOT CAUSE 5: TOXIC OVERLOAD
• Sluggish detoxification?
• Reaction to alcohol/caffeine?
• Chemical sensitivities?

Score each root cause 1-10. The DEEPEST imbalance is where you start.

Example: Client scores Blood Sugar 4, Gut 8, Inflammation 6, Deficiency 5, Toxic 7
→ Start with GUT. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Root Causes assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Nutrition Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client changes diet for a week, old habits return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No lasting results = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real habit change
• Built-in accountability
• You become their nutrition guide
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 6-WEEK TRANSFORMATION:

Week 1: Discovery + Quick Win (blood sugar focus)
Week 2: Elimination Phase + Support
Week 3: Gut Healing Protocol
Week 4: Anti-Inflammatory Deep Dive
Week 5: Nutrient Optimization
Week 6: Sustainability + Maintenance Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something compelling:
• "The Anti-Inflammatory Reset"
• "The Gut Healing Journey"
• "6 Weeks to Food Freedom"
• "The Whole Body Nutrition Protocol"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 6 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to say that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose medical conditions
• Prescribe supplements as treatment
• Tell someone to stop medications
• Claim to "cure" anything
• Replace medical nutrition therapy from an RD

✅ YOU CAN:
• Educate on whole food nutrition
• Create meal plans for general wellness
• Teach about anti-inflammatory foods
• Guide elimination protocols
• Share the science of food as medicine
• Recommend they see a doctor if needed
• Share your own nutrition journey

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If you have a diagnosed condition, please work with your doctor alongside our nutrition coaching."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You have leaky gut"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds like gut dysfunction. I'd recommend also working with your doctor while we focus on gut-supportive foods together."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "please work with your doctor" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Food Can't Fix Everything"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"My doctor says diet doesn't matter that much"
"My husband thinks this is a waste of money"
"I've tried every diet and nothing works"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE GROUNDING
"I hear you. A lot of people feel that way at first. What I teach isn't a diet - it's understanding how specific foods affect YOUR body. Very personalized, very evidence-based."

SCRIPT 2: THE EVIDENCE
"There are now thousands of studies showing the connection between nutrition and inflammation, gut health, and chronic conditions. What I do builds on that science."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"Your skepticism is actually smart. Let's start with what feels doable for you. We can go as slow or comprehensive as feels right."

NEVER SAY:
"Doctors don't know about nutrition"
"You just need to believe"
"Diets fail, my approach is different"

Position yourself as SCIENCE-BASED and PERSONALIZED, not anti-medicine.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

    // Day 20
    {
        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who struggles with bloating, inflammation, or food confusion? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them feeling better first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (recipe book, anti-inflammatory guide, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been dealing with some digestive issues. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in holistic nutrition, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring nutrition coaches:
• "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
• "What if I fail publicly?"
• "What if my family thinks it's just another fad?"
• "What if I don't know enough about food science?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
• "What if I'm being unrealistic about this career?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
Worst case: A few people judge me
What I'd do: Find clients who value experience over degrees
Cost of fear winning: Another year of not sharing my food healing gifts, staying in unfulfilling work

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
