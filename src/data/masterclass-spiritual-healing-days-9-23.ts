Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my spiritual healing practice while still working corporate, healing from my own burnout. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    // Day 10
    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Rachel...

Rachel joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago.

Her situation:
• 44 years old
• Corporate VP for 16 years
• Having panic attacks at work
• Felt "spiritually dead" despite external success
• Terrified of being seen as "woo-woo"

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started a free meditation circle
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 4 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,800/month working 12 hours/week
Month 8: $5,100/month with a waitlist, quit corporate

Rachel didn't have special gifts. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed to be some kind of guru. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Rachel used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful spiritual healers spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + self-care (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a sacred practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning spiritual practice (before anyone needs you)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that actually matters?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "sacred business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year feeling spiritually hollow
✗ Staying in work that drains your soul
✗ Watching other women step into their calling
✗ Same emptiness next year, same frustrations

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your soul's purpose with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to do spiritual work!!" - Rachel, 44
---

Rachel started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if people think I'm crazy?"
• "What if I freeze during a session?"
• "What if they don't have a breakthrough?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my yoga studio connection!" - Donna, 51

"Finally told my family about my practice. They're so proud of me." - Theresa, 47

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 2 people this week." - Carol, 55

These aren't special women with mystical powers.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you materials immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Session templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your spiritual calling by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Spiritual Healing Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: GROUNDING
Open with a brief centering breath together
"Let's take a moment to settle into this space..."

5-15 min: THE CHECK-IN
"How is your spirit feeling today?"
"What's been weighing on your heart?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how connected do you feel?"

15-40 min: THE HEALING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Releasing old wounds
• Reconnecting with purpose
• Clearing energy blocks
• Processing grief

Guide them through the exercise. Hold sacred space.

40-50 min: INTEGRATION
"What are you taking away from today?"
Give ONE practice for the week ahead.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Gratitude, next session, and a closing blessing.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to hold space for ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Root Causes Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY client? Use the 5 Root Causes of spiritual disconnection.

ROOT CAUSE 1: UNRESOLVED TRAUMA
• Past wounds still active?
• Body holding old pain?
• Triggers that take over?

ROOT CAUSE 2: ACCUMULATED GRIEF
• Losses not fully processed?
• Relationships ended without closure?
• Life transitions mourned?

ROOT CAUSE 3: CHRONIC BURNOUT
• Running on empty for how long?
• When did joy become rare?
• Soul exhaustion symptoms?

ROOT CAUSE 4: TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS
• Energy vampires in their life?
• Boundaries being violated?
• Feeling drained by specific people?

ROOT CAUSE 5: LOSS OF PURPOSE
• Disconnected from meaning?
• Living someone else's dream?
• "Is this all there is?" feeling?

Score each root cause 1-10. The DEEPEST wound is where you start.

Example: Client scores Trauma 4, Grief 8, Burnout 6, Toxic 5, Purpose 7
→ Start with GRIEF. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Root Causes assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Healing Journey

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, feels better, old patterns return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real healing
• Built-in accountability
• You become their spiritual guide
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable sacred income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK TRANSFORMATION:

Week 1: Discovery + Quick Breakthrough
Week 2: Deep Healing + Core Protocol
Week 3: Integration + Shadow Work
Week 4: Renewal + Next Steps Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something meaningful:
• "The Soul Restoration Journey"
• "The Spiritual Awakening Path"
• "21 Days to Inner Peace"
• "The Purpose Reconnection Program"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 4 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to do that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose mental health conditions
• Prescribe medications
• Tell someone to stop their meds or therapy
• Claim to "cure" anything
• Replace licensed mental health care

✅ YOU CAN:
• Facilitate spiritual wellness practices
• Guide meditation and breathwork
• Help with energy clearing and journaling
• Explore purpose and meaning
• Hold sacred space for processing
• Recommend they see a therapist if needed
• Share your own spiritual experiences

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If this is feeling like more than spiritual work, I encourage you to also speak with a licensed therapist."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You have depression"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds really heavy. Have you considered speaking with a therapist alongside our spiritual work? The combination can be really powerful."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "I encourage you to also speak with a therapist" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "This Sounds Too Woo-Woo"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Isn't this just new age stuff?"
"My husband thinks this is crazy"
"I'm not sure if I believe in this"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE GROUNDING
"I hear you. A lot of people feel that way at first. What I do is really grounded - it's about reconnecting with yourself through practices like journaling, breathwork, and reflective exercises. Very practical, very real results."

SCRIPT 2: THE EVIDENCE
"Meditation and mindfulness are now backed by thousands of studies. What I do builds on those same principles. It's about inner work, not magic."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"Your skepticism is actually healthy. Let's start with what feels comfortable for you. We can go as slow or deep as feels right."

NEVER SAY:
"You just don't understand"
"You need to be more open-minded"
"This works if you believe"

Position yourself as PRACTICAL and GROUNDED, not mystical.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who feels spiritually lost or stuck? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them breakthroughs first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (candle, journal, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been going through a lot spiritually. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in spiritual healing, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring spiritual healers:
• "What if people think I'm weird?"
• "What if I fail publicly?"
• "What if my family judges me?"
• "What if I'm not gifted enough?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
• "What if I'm being delusional about my calling?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if people think I'm weird?"
Worst case: A few people judge me
What I'd do: Find my people who GET it
Cost of fear winning: Another year ignoring my soul's calling, staying spiritually bankrupt

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
