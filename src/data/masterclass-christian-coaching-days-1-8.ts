TODAY'S LESSON: Your Testimony Is Your Ministry

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need seminary. You don't need 10 years of Bible college. You don't need to be a pastor.

Your TESTIMONY - your seasons of struggle, your wilderness moments, your faith journey - THAT is what makes women trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who only studied faith in books... or someone who has WALKED through the valley and found their way back to purpose?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "test" becomes your TESTIMONY.

"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony." - Revelation 12:11

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 faith struggles you've overcome. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Testimony to Ministry Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your church community).

        day: 2, gap: "first-3-clients", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Church Community

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE BIBLE STUDY FRIEND - The woman who mentioned she feels lost and purposeless

2️⃣ THE CHURCH ACQUAINTANCE - Someone who's seen your own faith transformation

3️⃣ THE FRIEND OF A FRIEND - Your small group leader's sister who's going through a hard season

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been going through a lot lately. I'm building my Christian coaching practice and looking for 3 women to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation to see if I can help?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

Just serving women you already know, in Jesus' name.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing-stewardship", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Calling Is Worth (The Stewardship Principle)

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free - it's ministry"

Here's the TRUTH from Scripture:
❌ FREE clients don't show up
❌ FREE clients don't do the work
❌ FREE clients don't transform
❌ FREE clients make you resent your calling

"The worker deserves his wages." - Luke 10:7

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the work
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

The Proverbs 31 woman SOLD her goods. She ran a BUSINESS while serving her family and honoring God.

Stewardship means MULTIPLYING what God gave you, not burying it.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week Journey: $297-$397
• 3-Month Transformation: $997-$1,497

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

    },

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal-scope", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple (Scope of Practice)

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Background, faith journey, goals, current struggles

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a licensed therapist or pastoral counselor. This is faith-based life coaching, not mental health treatment or church counseling."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You facilitate faith-aligned growth, NOT diagnose mental illness or replace pastoral care

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a seminary degree.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Kingdom Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In your church, women's ministry, Bible study
📌 In Facebook groups for Christian women, faith & life
📌 Looking for someone who SHARES their faith foundation

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ CHURCH COMMUNITY - Speak at women's events, offer workshops
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every woman you help tells 3 others
3️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join Christian women's groups. Add value. No pitching.
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect heart to heart.

No algorithms. No hashtags.
Just kingdom connections.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for Christian women. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to do this?"
"What if I'm not called enough?"
"I'm not a real coach - I'm just a church volunteer"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to be perfect. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

🔥 Your HUMANITY is your gift. Clients don't want a saint - they want someone REAL who loves Jesus.

🔥 Your testimony is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." - Ephesians 2:10

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now that you wish you knew 5 years ago about faith and life.
