Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist. (Our ADHD brains will ALWAYS find a reason to wait!)

I started my ADHD coaching practice while still working my day job, managing my own executive dysfunction. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI ADHD Coach Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Melissa...

Melissa joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago.

Her situation:
• 47 years old
• School counselor for 15 years
• Got diagnosed with ADHD at 42
• Lost 3 jobs before diagnosis
• Felt "fundamentally broken"

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started a free support group
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 5 more clients through ADHD community referrals
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 14 hours/week
Month 10: $4,600/month with 14 clients, left school counseling

Melissa didn't have a "fixed" ADHD brain. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates (saved her ADHD brain SO much effort)
✅ Showed up to weekly calls (accountability!)
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought my ADHD made me unemployable. Turns out it makes me the BEST person to help women like me. My 'broken' brain was my biggest asset all along."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Melissa used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM that works for ADHD brains.

Here's how successful ADHD coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + brain break (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building an ADHD-friendly practice that works WITH your brain.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• During your hyperfocus window (whenever that is for YOU)
• Body doubling with another coach
• Timeblocking with alarms (because time blindness!)
• Weekend batch session when you have momentum

Real women with ADHD brains do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that actually uses my ADHD gifts?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "ADHD coaching time." Set alarms!

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year not understanding your ADHD
✗ Staying in work that doesn't fit your brain
✗ Watching other women step into ADHD coaching
✗ Same scattered struggles next year

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= Less than all those ADHD apps you bought and didn't use
= Less than the productivity course you never finished

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your ADHD coaching career with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week ADHD program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help women with ADHD!!" - Melissa, 47
---

Melissa started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if my own ADHD makes me unreliable?"
• "What if I freeze during a session?"
• "What if they don't have a breakthrough?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT who gets her because she GETS them.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my ADHD Facebook group!" - Karen, 52

"Finally told my family about my coaching practice. My daughter who has ADHD is so proud of me." - Linda, 49

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 3 women this week. All late-diagnosed like me." - Janet, 44

These aren't women with "managed" ADHD.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID despite their scattered brains.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you ADHD materials immediately
• Weekly calls for accountability (essential for ADHD!)
• Community of 200+ ADHD coaches supporting you
• Session templates designed for neurodivergent clients
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone (hard with ADHD!)
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your ADHD coaching career by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First ADHD Coaching Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE ADHD SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: BRAIN CHECK-IN
Start with a grounding exercise (our clients need this!)
"Before we dive in, let's take 3 deep breaths together..."

5-15 min: THE ADHD CHECK-IN
"How has your brain been this week?"
"What's been working? What's been hard?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how regulated do you feel?"

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Time management strategy
• Emotional regulation tool
• Executive function hack
• Relationship communication tip

Guide them through the strategy. Let them talk (we love to process out loud!)

40-50 min: ADHD-FRIENDLY ACTION PLAN
"What's ONE tiny step you'll take before our next session?"
Make it SMALL. Make it SPECIFIC. Set a reminder together!

50-60 min: CLOSE
Recap, celebrate wins, schedule next session NOW (no back-and-forth emails!)

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to help them take ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The D.E.P.T.H. Method Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY ADHD client? Use the D.E.P.T.H. Method.

D - DISCOVER: What are their unique ADHD patterns?
• When were they diagnosed?
• What are their specific struggles?
• How does ADHD show up in their life?

E - EDUCATE: What do they understand about their brain?
• Do they know why they do what they do?
• Have they been shamed for ADHD traits?
• What myths do they believe about themselves?

P - PLAN: What systems have they tried?
• What's worked in the past?
• What's never worked (and why)?
• What do they WISH they could do?

T - TRACK: How do they measure progress?
• Are they noticing patterns?
• What triggers overwhelm?
• When do they feel most regulated?

H - HARMONIZE: How can they work WITH their brain?
• What are their ADHD superpowers?
• Where is friction with neurotypical expectations?
• How can life fit THEIR brain?

Score each area 1-10. The LOWEST score is where you start.

Example: Client scores D-8, E-4, P-6, T-3, H-5
→ Start with TRACK. Help them see their patterns first.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the D.E.P.T.H. assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature ADHD Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN for ADHD coaching:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, feels motivated, then old patterns return
• No accountability between sessions (our clients NEED this!)
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep transformation = no testimonials

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real habit change
• Built-in accountability (essential for ADHD!)
• You become their ADHD partner
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK ADHD JUMPSTART:

Week 1: D.E.P.T.H. Discovery + Quick Win
Week 2: Brain Education + Executive Function Hack
Week 3: Systems Building + Tracking Setup
Week 4: Harmonizing Life + Maintenance Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something meaningful:
• "The ADHD Brain Reset"
• "The Late Diagnosis Recovery Program"
• "4 Weeks to Understanding Your Brain"
• "The Executive Function Jumpstart"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 4 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to do that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose ADHD or any condition
• Prescribe medication
• Tell someone to change their meds
• Claim to "cure" ADHD
• Replace doctors, psychiatrists, or therapists

✅ YOU CAN:
• Help with ADHD life strategies and systems
• Teach executive function hacks
• Guide time management and organization
• Support emotional regulation techniques
• Help with relationship communication
• Recommend they see a doctor if undiagnosed
• Share your own ADHD experiences

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If what you're describing sounds like it might need medical or clinical support, I encourage you to also speak with your doctor or a therapist. I can support you with coaching alongside that."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You definitely have ADHD"
Say: "What you're describing sounds really familiar to me and many women I work with. Have you considered talking to a doctor about getting assessed? Coaching can help either way, but diagnosis opens more doors."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the magic phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Is ADHD Coaching Even Real?"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Can't you just try harder?"
"My husband thinks ADHD is an excuse"
"I'm not sure if coaching can really help"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE SCIENCE
"ADHD is a real neurological condition - it's about how the brain is wired, specifically around dopamine and executive function. Coaching helps people work WITH their brain wiring instead of fighting against it. It's practical strategies, not 'trying harder.'"

SCRIPT 2: THE VALIDATION
"I hear you. A lot of people are skeptical, especially if they haven't experienced ADHD themselves. What I've seen is that when women finally get strategies that work FOR their brain instead of against it, everything changes."

SCRIPT 3: THE REDIRECT
"Your skepticism is actually healthy. Let's start with what feels comfortable for you. We can go as slow or deep as feels right."

NEVER SAY:
"You just don't understand ADHD"
"You need to be more supportive"
"This would work if you believed"

Position yourself as PRACTICAL and SCIENCE-BASED, not defensive.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

    // Day 20
    {
        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest ADHD clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you because they trust the person who referred them.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE woman in your life who might also be struggling with ADHD, diagnosed or not? I'd love to help her like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them breakthroughs first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (ADHD planner, journal, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been dealing with some ADHD-related challenges. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in ADHD coaching, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window (and we know how ADHD time blindness works!).

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The ADHD Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them. (Set a timer - 5 minutes - or you'll overthink!)

Common ones I hear from aspiring ADHD coaches:
• "What if my own ADHD makes me unreliable?"
• "What if I fail publicly and prove everyone right?"
• "What if I can't focus enough to build a business?"
• "What if I'm not 'ADHD enough' or 'too ADHD'?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
• "What if this is just another thing I start and don't finish?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if my ADHD makes me unreliable?"
Worst case: I miss a session or deadline once
What I'd do: Apologize, reschedule, set up better systems
Cost of fear winning: Another year feeling like my ADHD is a curse instead of using it to help others

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of making a mistake.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above. (Timer: 15 minutes max!)
