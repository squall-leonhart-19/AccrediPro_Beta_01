Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist. 

I started my practice with 2 kids at home, a part-time job, and zero confidence. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification 
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, protocols)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Marketing templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    // Day 10
    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Maria...

Maria joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago.

Her situation:
• 54 years old
• Former elementary school teacher
• Going through a divorce
• Zero business experience
• Terrified of "marketing herself"

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, set up Calendly, told friends
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 3 more clients from referrals
Month 4: Raised prices to $297, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 12-15 hours/week
Month 8: $4,800/month with a waitlist

Maria didn't have a special gift. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed years of experience. Turns out I just needed the right guidance and to actually START."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Maria used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful practitioners spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Admin + content (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min earlier wake-up (before anyone needs you)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch session

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for something that matters?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year wondering "what if"
✗ Staying in a job that drains you
✗ Watching other women do what YOU wanted to do
✗ Same place next year, same frustrations

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you think through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week program. I was shaking! This works!!" - Jennifer, 48
---

Jennifer started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if no one wants to pay me?"
• "What if I freeze on the call?"
• "What if they ask something I can't answer?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through a church friend referral!" - Lisa, 52

"Finally told my family about my practice. They're so proud of me." - Denise, 47

"Raised my prices to $397 and booked 2 people this week." - Carol, 55

These aren't special women with special gifts.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you materials immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Marketing templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your income by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Client Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: WARM UP
"How are you feeling today? How was your week?"
(Build rapport, let them settle in)

5-15 min: THE CHECK-IN
"What's been going well?"
"What's been challenging?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how's your energy/sleep/mood?"

15-40 min: THE TEACHING
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Sleep optimization
• Stress management  
• Blood sugar basics
• Gut health foundations

Teach the concept. Give 1-2 actionable steps.

40-50 min: THE ACTION PLAN
"So for this week, you're going to [specific action]"
Write it down for them. Make it CLEAR.

50-60 min: CLOSE
"Same time next week?"
"Questions before we wrap?"

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to help them take ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

    {
        day: 16, gap: "five-pillar", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5-Pillar Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY client? Use the 5 Pillars.

PILLAR 1: SLEEP
• Hours per night?
• Quality (1-10)?
• Wake up rested?
• Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?

PILLAR 2: STRESS
• Stress level (1-10)?
• What are main stressors?
• How do they cope?
• Physical stress symptoms?

PILLAR 3: NUTRITION
• Typical breakfast/lunch/dinner?
• Water intake?
• Sugar/processed food?
• Any food sensitivities?

PILLAR 4: MOVEMENT
• Exercise frequency?
• Type of movement?
• Sedentary hours per day?
• Energy for activity?

PILLAR 5: DIGESTION
• Bloating?
• Regularity?
• Gas/discomfort?
• Food reactions?

Score each pillar 1-10. The LOWEST score is where you start.

Example: Client scores Sleep 4, Stress 7, Nutrition 6, Movement 5, Digestion 8
→ Start with SLEEP. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5-Pillar assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

        day: 17, gap: "signature-program", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't get results.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, gets info, never follows through
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real results
• Built-in accountability
• You become their "person" for health
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK TRANSFORMATION:

Week 1: Assessment + Quick Wins
Week 2: Deep Dive + Primary Protocol
Week 3: Adjustments + Problem Solving
Week 4: Review + Next Steps Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something specific:
• "The Energy Reset Program"
• "The Hormone Harmony Method"
• "21 Days to Better Sleep"
• "The Gut Healing Jumpstart"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 4 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to say that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose diseases or conditions
• Prescribe medications
• Tell someone to stop taking medications
• Order or interpret lab tests (unless specifically trained)
• Make claims to cure/treat specific diseases

✅ YOU CAN:
• Share educational information about health
• Discuss nutrition, supplements, lifestyle
• Help with goal-setting and accountability
• Recommend they discuss things with their doctor
• Share what you've learned, read, experienced
• Suggest lifestyle modifications

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"I encourage you to discuss this with your healthcare provider."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative rather than competitive with doctors.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "Your thyroid is underactive"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds similar to thyroid symptoms. Have you had your levels checked recently? Worth mentioning to your doctor."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "I encourage you to discuss with your doctor" phrase 5 times.

    {
        day: 19, gap: "handling-doctors", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "But My Doctor Said..."

Every client will say some version of this:
"My doctor said it's just stress"
"My doctor says my labs are normal"
"My doctor would never approve of supplements"

How to handle it (without undermining doctors):

SCRIPT 1: THE REFRAME
"Your doctor is right that your labs are in the 'normal' range. What we're looking at is OPTIMAL ranges, which are narrower. There's a difference between 'not sick' and 'feeling great.'"

SCRIPT 2: THE COLLABORATION
"What's great is that what we work on - nutrition, sleep, stress - works ALONGSIDE whatever your doctor recommends. We're not replacing medical care, we're adding lifestyle support."

SCRIPT 3: THE EXPERIENCE VALIDATION
"I hear that your doctor dismissed your fatigue. That's frustrating. What I want you to know is that your experience is REAL, even if tests haven't explained it yet. Let's see what lifestyle factors might be contributing."

NEVER SAY:
"Your doctor is wrong"
"Doctors don't know about this"
"Ignore what your doctor said"

Position yourself as a COMPLEMENT, not a replacement.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who's struggling with [energy/weight/hormones]? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC problem.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them wins first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (gift card, free session, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been dealing with [issue]. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear:
• "What if no one pays me?"
• "What if I fail publicly?"
• "What if people I know judge me?"
• "What if I'm not good enough?"
• "What if I give bad advice?"
• "What if I can't get clients?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if no one pays me?"
Worst case: 3 months of trying, zero clients
What I'd do: Learn from what didn't work, adjust messaging, keep trying
Cost of fear winning: Another year in a job I hate, same frustration

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of failure.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
