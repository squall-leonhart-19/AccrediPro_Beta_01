Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my pet nutrition practice while still working full-time, heartbroken over losing my own pet. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Pet Nutrition Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, intake forms, feeding plans)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Pet parent attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Brianna...

Brianna joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago.

Her situation:
• 44 years old
• Lost her golden retriever Biscuit to cancer at age 8
• Felt guilty about feeding him kibble for years
• Wondered if better nutrition could have saved him
• Terrified of giving "wrong" advice

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started a free Facebook group for pet parents
Month 2: First paying client ($197 nutrition assessment)
Month 3: 5 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 15 hours/week
Month 10: $4,200/month with a waitlist

Brianna didn't have special knowledge. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you feeding plan templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed a vet degree. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START helping pets."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Brianna used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💚`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful pet nutrition consultants spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client consultation (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client follow-up (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + pet research (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client consultation (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a pet nutrition practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning walk with your own pet (think + plan)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that helps fur babies thrive?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "pet nutrition business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year watching pets struggle with preventable issues
✗ Staying in work that doesn't fulfill your pet-loving soul
✗ Watching other women help fur babies while you wait
✗ Same frustration next year, same "someday" thinking

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 nutrition consultations at entry-level pricing
= Less than what most people spend on vet bills annually
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in helping pets with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week pet nutrition program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help fur babies thrive!!" - Brianna, 44
---

Brianna started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if I give wrong nutrition advice?"
• "What if the pet doesn't improve?"
• "What if pet parents think I'm not qualified?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT and their dog is thriving.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my dog park connection!" - Donna, 51

"Finally told my family about my pet nutrition practice. They're so proud of me." - Theresa, 47

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 3 pet parents this week." - Carol, 55

These aren't special women with veterinary degrees.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you feeding plan templates immediately
• Weekly calls to ask pet nutrition questions
• Community of 200+ pet nutrition practitioners
• Consultation templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure out pet nutrition alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay helping fur babies by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💚

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Pet Nutrition Consultation

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE CONSULTATION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: CONNECT
Open with genuine interest in their pet
"Tell me about [pet's name]! How old? Personality?"

5-15 min: THE PET HISTORY
"What are you currently feeding?"
"Any health issues, allergies, or concerns?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how is their energy/coat/digestion?"

15-40 min: THE NUTRITION ASSESSMENT
Review their current food ingredient by ingredient
Identify the biggest nutrition gaps
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Transitioning off kibble
• Addressing allergies
• Weight management
• Digestive health

40-50 min: THE FEEDING PLAN
Give ONE clear recommendation for this week
Specific foods, portions, transition steps

50-60 min: CLOSE
Next check-in schedule, answer questions, celebrate their commitment to their fur baby

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to overhaul their whole diet. You need to guide ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your consultation structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Pillars Pet Nutrition Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY pet's diet? Use the 5 Pillars of Optimal Pet Nutrition.

PILLAR 1: PROTEIN QUALITY
• Is the protein source identifiable? (chicken vs "meat byproducts")
• Is it the first ingredient?
• What percentage of the diet is quality protein?

PILLAR 2: MOISTURE CONTENT
• Dry kibble = 10% moisture (dehydrating!)
• Wet food = 75% moisture
• Raw/fresh = 70-80% moisture
• Pets need WATER in their food!

PILLAR 3: INGREDIENT TRANSPARENCY
• Can you pronounce everything?
• Are there artificial colors/flavors?
• How many fillers (corn, wheat, soy)?

PILLAR 4: NUTRIENT DENSITY
• Whole foods vs synthetic vitamins?
• Fresh vs heavily processed?
• Bioavailable nutrients?

PILLAR 5: DIGESTIBILITY
• Stool quality (firm, not too much)
• Coat condition
• Energy levels

Score each pillar 1-10. The LOWEST score is where you start.

Example: Protein 6, Moisture 3, Transparency 5, Density 4, Digestibility 7
→ Start with MOISTURE. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Pet parents understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Pillars assessment on YOUR pet's current diet. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Pet Nutrition Program

Stop selling single consultations. They don't create transformation for pets.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE CONSULTATIONS:
• Pet parent gets excited, old habits return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep pet transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real dietary change
• Built-in accountability for pet parents
• You become their go-to pet nutrition guide

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to say that about pet food?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose medical conditions
• Prescribe medications
• Tell someone to stop their pet's medications
• Claim to "cure" diseases
• Replace veterinary care

✅ YOU CAN:
• Educate on species-appropriate nutrition
• Read and interpret ingredient labels
• Create feeding plans and meal schedules
• Recommend whole food additions
• Suggest elimination protocols for allergies
• Guide transitions between foods
• Share general nutrition research
• Recommend they see a vet if you notice red flags

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"For any medical concerns, please consult with your veterinarian. I work alongside your vet to optimize your pet's nutrition."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "Your dog has allergies"
Say: "Some of these symptoms could be related to diet. I'd recommend checking with your vet to rule out medical causes, and meanwhile we can try an elimination diet to see if food is a factor."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "work alongside your vet" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "My Vet Says Kibble Is Fine"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Our vet recommends this prescription food"
"My vet says fresh food is dangerous"
"I'm not sure if raw is safe"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE COLLABORATION
"I totally respect your vet's medical expertise! What I do is look specifically at the nutrition side. Many vets have limited nutrition training in vet school - just like MDs have limited nutrition training. We can work together with your vet for the best outcome."

SCRIPT 2: THE EVIDENCE
"There's a lot of new research on species-appropriate nutrition that wasn't available when many vets trained. I can share some resources if you're interested. My approach is food-first, always working alongside your vet."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"Your concern shows you're a great pet parent! Let's start with what feels comfortable for you. Even small changes can make a big difference."

NEVER SAY:
"Your vet is wrong"
"Vets just push prescription food for money"
"Kibble is killing your pet"

Position yourself as COMPLEMENTARY to veterinary care, not competing.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Pet Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you because their friend's pet is thriving.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad [pet's name] is doing so well! Quick question - who's ONE pet parent friend of yours whose fur baby is struggling with [allergies/weight/low energy]? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC pet issue.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get their pet a visible win first (shinier coat, more energy, better digestion)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (pet treat bag, toy, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned [pet's name] has been struggling with [issue]. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call about their nutrition? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation → Happy pet.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community helping pets.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in pet nutrition, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real for helping fur babies.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you from helping pets.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring pet nutrition consultants:
• "What if I give wrong advice and hurt a pet?"
• "What if I fail publicly?"
• "What if pet parents think I'm not qualified?"
• "What if I don't know enough about every pet food?"
• "What if their pet doesn't improve?"
• "What if I'm not as good as people with vet degrees?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if pet parents think I'm not qualified?"
Worst case: A few people choose someone else
What I'd do: Find pet parents who value my approach
Cost of fear winning: Another year of pets eating garbage while I stay silent

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
