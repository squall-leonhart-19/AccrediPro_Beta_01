TODAY'S LESSON: Your Clinical Experience Is Your Superpower

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need to start from scratch. You don't need to forget everything you learned in nursing. You don't need to "find a new identity."

Your EXPERIENCE - your burnout, your compassion fatigue, your breaking point - THAT is what makes nurses trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with a coach who read about nurse burnout in a textbook... or someone who's cried in the supply closet after a code and found their way back?

Exactly.

Your clinical background becomes your CREDIBILITY.
Your burnout becomes your BRIDGE to clients.
Your "I almost left nursing" story becomes your CONNECTION.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 nursing struggles you've overcome. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Nursing Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your breakroom).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Unit

Stop scrolling LinkedIn looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE BREAKROOM FRIEND - The nurse who vents to you about wanting to quit

2️⃣ THE NURSING SCHOOL BUDDY - Someone who's seen your transformation, still stuck in bedside

3️⃣ THE HOSPITAL NETWORK - Your old preceptee, the charge nurse from your last unit, the NP who always looks exhausted

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been struggling with [burnout/work-life balance/figuring out what's next]. I'm building my nurse coaching practice and looking for 3 nurses to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute call?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

These are people who already TRUST you because you've worked codes together. You've held hands with dying patients together. You GET each other.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE nurse today with the script above.

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Expertise Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free - I'm just a nurse, not a life coach"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't show up
❌ FREE clients don't do the work
❌ FREE clients don't transform
❌ FREE clients make you resent your second career

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the work
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

Your 25+ years of clinical experience, your understanding of healthcare culture, your ability to assess and support - that's VALUABLE.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week Burnout Recovery: $297-$397
• 3-Month Career Transition: $997-$1,497

You're not "just a nurse." You're a clinical expert who understands healthcare from the inside.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

    },

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Nursing background, current role, goals, burnout level

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am a nurse coach, not providing clinical nursing care or medical advice. This is wellness coaching, not therapy or treatment."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You coach for wellness and transitions, NOT diagnose, prescribe, or provide clinical care

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), malpractice insurance (separate from your clinical coverage), or a lawyer.

As a nurse, you already understand scope of practice. This is just a different scope.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Nurse Coach Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Nurse Coach Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

        day: 5, gap: "tech", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Tech for Busy Nurses

Your ENTIRE tech stack to start:

📅 CALENDLY (free) - Clients book themselves (no more playing phone tag between shifts)
💳 STRIPE/PAYPAL (free) - Get paid online
📝 GOOGLE DOCS (free) - Forms, notes, session prep
📱 ZOOM (free) - Video sessions

THAT'S IT. 4 free tools.

You can run a $3k/month nurse coaching practice with these.

I know you're probably more comfortable with Epic than Calendly, but trust me - this is WAY simpler than charting.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Set up Calendly. Add 2-3 time slots. Takes 10 minutes.

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Nurse Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for burnt out nurses, nursing career changers
📌 At nursing conferences, ANCC chapter meetings
📌 In your hospital's break room RIGHT NOW
📌 Looking for someone they TRUST (another nurse)

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join nursing burnout groups. Add value. Share your story.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every nurse you help tells 3 others (we gossip, its what we do)
3️⃣ NURSING NETWORKS - Speak at nursing schools, hospital wellness fairs
4️⃣ LINKEDIN - Connect with nursing leaders, share insights about burnout

No algorithms. No hashtags. Just nurses helping nurses.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for nursing burnout or career transitions. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to coach? I'm just a bedside nurse"
"What if I'm not experienced enough?"
"Real coaches have fancy degrees"
"I'm good at nursing, not business"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need an MBA. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD of the nurses you're helping.

🔥 Your NURSING skills are your gift. Assessment. Active listening. Meeting people in crisis.

🔥 Your burnout is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are. You found your way out.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 3 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help nurses where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now about surviving nursing that you wish you knew earlier.
