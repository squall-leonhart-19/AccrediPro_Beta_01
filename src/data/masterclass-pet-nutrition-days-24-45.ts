TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Entertainment

You know a LOT now about pet nutrition. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find pet parent clients
• How to price your services
• How to run nutrition consultations
• How to get referrals
• What to say about ingredients, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Pet Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE pet parent about their fur baby's nutrition
• Set up Calendly for consultations
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about pet nutrition
• Complete your pet intake form
• Practice reading a pet food label out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence.

Stop learning about pet nutrition. Start DOING it.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Pet Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING for pet businesses. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a PET WIN. Not after 6 months. After their fur baby has ANY visible improvement.
• "Max's coat is so shiny now!"
• "She finally stopped itching!"
• "He has so much more energy!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's amazing! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about [pet's name]'s transformation? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], [pet's name] was [struggling with X]. After [timeframe], [pet] is [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

BONUS: Ask for BEFORE/AFTER PHOTOS of their pet! These are GOLD.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook posts with pet photos
• Discovery call prep ("Look at Max's transformation...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANY pet (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Pet Nutrition Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help (dogs? cats? both?)
• Shows your face AND your pets
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo with your pets + headline
"I help pet parents feed their fur babies for optimal health and longevity"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"After losing my beloved dog to cancer at 8, I became obsessed with pet nutrition..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Pet Nutrition Transformation - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes with pet photos
Even if informal. Even if from helping friends' pets.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Create your 1-page pet nutrition website. Use the template. 30 minutes max.

        day: 27, gap: "boundaries", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Boundaries With Pet Parent Clients

As you help more pets, you'll encounter:
• "Can I text you anytime my dog vomits?"
• "I know we're done but just one more food question..."
• "Can we do a call at 10pm? That's when I feed him."
• "I need you to be available for pet emergencies"

Setting boundaries isn't unloving. It's ESSENTIAL for sustainable pet work.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to pet nutrition questions within 24-48 hours. For pet medical emergencies, please contact your vet or emergency animal hospital."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold pet consultations Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-3pm. For emergencies, that's what your vet is for."

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on nutrition - food choices, feeding schedules, supplements. For medical symptoms, I'll refer you to your vet immediately."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I check messages once per day to give quality attention to each pet case. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for Busy Pet-Loving Women

You have kids. Or grandkids. Or aging parents. Or a job. Or all of the above. Plus your own pets!

Time is limited. Here's how to make your pet biz work:

THE BATCH METHOD:

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting), batch similar tasks:

• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon, create a week's worth of pet nutrition posts
• CONSULTATION DAY: Stack all your pet consultations on 2 days
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, feeding plan creation, invoicing all at once

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your pet business:
• 6:00-6:30am morning walk with your dog (think + plan)
• 12:00-12:30pm lunch break
• 8:00-9:00pm after kids are down

These are YOURS. No guilt.

THE 80/20 RULE:

20% of your activities create 80% of pet results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, consultations, referral asks, before/after posts
Low ROI: Scrolling pet Instagram, "researching" one more food, reorganizing files

Do MORE of the 20%. Ignore the rest.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating pet nutrition as a HOBBY or a CALLING?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

HOBBY:
• Help friends' pets for free
• No pressure to get clients
• Learn at your own pace
• Maybe make some side income eventually

CALLING:
• Building an actual pet nutrition practice
• Helping fur babies consistently
• Getting paying clients
• Replacing or supplementing your income
• Doing this for REAL to help more pets

Both are valid.

But only one leads to the impact you're actually yearning for.

If you're choosing CALLING...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself. Which are you choosing?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating pet nutrition as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find pet parent clients (dog parks, Facebook groups, referrals)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 programs)
✅ You know how to run consultations (60-min structure)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, disclaimers, vet collaboration)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to market (Facebook groups, word of mouth, local partnerships)
✅ You know how to handle vet skepticism
✅ You know your scope of practice
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonials

You have EVERYTHING you need to help pets...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for pet nutrition:

🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification provides documentation of your training and competence

💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified Pet Nutrition Specialist" vs "someone who read about dog food"

🐕 PET PARENT TRUST: Pet parents choose certified consultants - it removes their skepticism

👩‍⚕️ VET COLLABORATION: Vets take you more seriously with a credential

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified consultants charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have passion.
With the credential, you have a PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Math That Changes Everything

Let's do the math together...

CAREER ACCELERATOR INVESTMENT: $297

YOUR FIRST PET CLIENT:
• 4-Week Pet Nutrition Transformation = $297
• ONE client = Investment recovered ✅

YOUR THIRD CLIENT:
• 3 x $297 = $891
• Profit after investment: $594

YOUR FIRST YEAR (Conservative):
• 2 pet clients/month x 12 months = 24 clients
• 24 x $297 = $7,128
• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our pet nutrition graduates are actually doing.

Brianna started 10 months ago. She now makes $4,200/month.
Donna started 8 months ago. She makes $2,400/month.
Theresa started 5 months ago. She just hit $1,200/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are with pet nutrition.

The difference? They saw the math and made the decision to help pets for real.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 pet clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Brianna - From Grieving Pet Mom to $4,200/Month Helping Fur Babies

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Brianna joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 44 years old
• Lost her golden retriever Biscuit to cancer at age 8
• Felt guilty for years about feeding him kibble
• Wondered if better nutrition could have saved him
• Terrified of not knowing enough

THE TURNING POINT:
• Dove deep into pet nutrition research
• Realized most pet parents are making the same mistakes
• "If I can help other pets avoid what Biscuit went through..."

NOW (10 months later):
• $4,200/month income (part-time, 18 hours/week)
• 14 active pet clients
• Waitlist of 8 more
• Helps dogs AND cats now
• "I turned my biggest heartbreak into my biggest purpose."

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 2 years feeling guilty about Biscuit. Now I honor him by helping other pets live longer, healthier lives. Your pet story isn't your shame - it's your superpower."

Brianna is real. Her results are real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Watch Brianna's full story in the Resources section.

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started with pet nutrition...

You can have all the passion in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone.

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - ingredients, clients, vet pushback
• Real-time feedback on pet cases
• Never feel stuck alone

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Feeding plan templates
• Intake forms with breed-specific questions
• Email scripts for pet parents
• Social media posts about pet nutrition
• All customized for your pet practice

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified pet nutrition consultants
• Share wins and challenging pet cases
• Accountability partners
• Referral network for different specialties

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT.

I tried to learn pet nutrition alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got mentorship, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping You

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back from helping pets. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR:

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
I get it. Money feels tight. Here's the truth: $297 is ONE pet client. If you can't find ONE pet parent with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my pet nutrition graduates. They have kids, jobs, their own pets to care for. They found 5-10 hours/week. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY. If helping pets is your calling, you'll make time.

😰 "I'M NOT READY"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Brianna wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting.

🐕 "WHAT IF I GIVE WRONG ADVICE?"
You know more than 90% of pet parents. You have the 5 Pillars framework. You know when to refer to a vet. That's enough to start helping pets today.

🤔 "WHAT IF THEIR PET DOESN'T IMPROVE?"
What if it does? What if you help a dog live 3 more years? The only guaranteed failure is ignoring your calling.

Which one is YOUR objection?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with YOUR #1 concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it while pets continue suffering.

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you.

The women who succeed in helping pets aren't superhuman. They just DECIDE and ACT when the window is open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Future Self Helping Pets

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's a pet parent sending a photo of their dog's shiny coat
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,400 came in this week from helping fur babies
• You're sitting in your office with your own pet by your feet
• You just finished a consultation and the pet parent is in happy tears
• You look at your calendar - only working 15 hours this week
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel ALIVE. You're HELPING PETS THRIVE.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our pet nutrition graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Brianna was crying over losing Biscuit.
Now she makes $4,200/month helping pets live longer.

6 months ago, Donna thought she was "too old" to help animals.
Now she has 10 pet clients and a waiting list.

You are 6 months away from a completely different life helping fur babies.

The question is: Will you answer the call?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today about helping pets?

6 days left.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets about helping pets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of women:

THE WAIT TRAP:
"I'll do pet nutrition next month..."
"After the holidays..."
"When things calm down..."
"When I have more money saved..."

Things never calm down. There's never a perfect time. The women who wait usually end up in the same place a year later, wishing they'd started helping pets.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences for pets that could be helped NOW.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up for pet cert but forgot" → Paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Life got in the way" → Stayed stuck while pets kept suffering

You've invested 39 days in pet nutrition. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Pet Nutrition Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed
✅ Skills for running pet nutrition consultations
✅ Systems for getting pet parent clients
✅ Knowledge for helping fur babies thrive
✅ Community of women supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY pet materials. Join weekly calls. Build your real pet practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out pet nutrition alone. Always valid.

OPTION 3: Wait
Let life get busy. Forget about pet nutrition. Come back in 6 months when you're "ready." (Most people choose this. Most people stay stuck while pets keep suffering.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest.

The women making $3K-$6K/month helping pets didn't have special powers. They DECIDED and ACTED.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage with pet nutrition, I almost didn't take the leap. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next month"
• "I need to learn more first"
• "What if I give wrong advice?"
• "Who am I to help pets?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became confident.
Not because I had all the answers.
Not because I felt "ready."

But because I DECIDED that helping pets was worth more than my fear.

The pet nutrition graduates making $3,000-$6,000/month aren't superhuman. They're not more knowledgeable than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of pet nutrition training. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you help pets.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days learning about pet nutrition. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART for animals.

Most people don't make it this far. Most people quit by Day 7.

Not you.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Pet Nutrition Career Accelerator.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment to helping pets. I know your story (or at least I can feel your love for animals). And I believe you have what it takes to help fur babies for real.

Pet lover to pet lover: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your questions about nutrition.

And let's help pets together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💚

P.S. - If you have ANY questions about pet nutrition certification, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really feel into it:

Do you believe in your calling to help pets?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to do this someday."
Not "maybe if I learn more about pet food."

Do you BELIEVE - deep in your heart - that you can help fur babies thrive and build a pet nutrition practice?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and helping pets is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days. I've seen your commitment to learning about pet nutrition.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your calling to help pets?

48 hours to decide.
