TODAY'S LESSON: Your Hands Were Made For Healing

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need to be born with special gifts. You don't need psychic abilities. You don't need to see auras.

Your HANDS - the warmth you feel, the tingling when you touch someone in pain, the instinct to place your palm on someone who's hurting - THAT is your natural healing ability.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather learn Reiki from someone who only read about it... or someone who FEELS it in their hands?

Exactly.

Your "sensitivity" becomes your SUPERPOWER.
Your "caring too much" becomes your GIFT.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Rub your palms together for 30 seconds. Hold them 6 inches apart. Notice what you feel between them. Write it down.

📎 Download: "Reiki Sensitivity Assessment" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE STRESSED FRIEND - The woman who mentions she can't sleep or relax

2️⃣ THE HEALTHCARE COWORKER - Someone who's burnt out like you used to be

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S FRIEND - Your sister's stressed colleague, daughter's overwhelmed friend

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been dealing with a lot of stress lately. I'm building my Reiki practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute session?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Reiki Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free - it's a spiritual gift"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't value the session
❌ FREE clients cancel last minute
❌ FREE clients don't commit to healing
❌ FREE clients drain YOUR energy

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients show up ready
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $85-$125
• 4-Session Package: $297-$397
• 3-Month Transformation: $897-$1,297

Reiki is VALUABLE. Energy exchange (money) honors the healing.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Health concerns, stress areas, what they hope to feel

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a medical practitioner. Reiki is a complementary wellness practice, not medical treatment."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You facilitate Reiki sessions, NOT diagnose or prescribe

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Reiki Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for stress relief, wellness, healthcare worker support
📌 At yoga studios, massage centers, holistic wellness fairs
📌 Looking for someone they TRUST and feel SAFE with

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join wellness/stress relief groups. Add value. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every person you help tells 3 others
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at wellness centers, yoga studios, hospital breakrooms
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect heart to heart.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for stressed women or wellness seekers. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to do Reiki?"
"What if I'm not attuned enough?"
"I'm not a real healer"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to be a Reiki Master. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

🔥 Your WARMTH is your gift. Clients don't want a guru - they want someone who CARES.

🔥 Your struggles are your qualification. You've FELT what they feel.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now about healing that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
