Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my integrative health practice while still working hospital shifts, dealing with my own burnout. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification in Integrative Health
• Done-For-You materials (intake forms, protocol templates, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    // Day 10
    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Patricia...

Patricia joined the Career Accelerator 6 months ago.

Her situation:
• 49 years old
• RN for 20 years
• Burned out watching patients cycle through without healing
• Frustrated by symptom-only treatment
• Afraid of leaving clinical work

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started helping burned out nurses
Month 2: First paying client ($297 root cause program)
Month 3: 5 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $397, still booking
Month 6: $4,800/month working 18 hours/week, left hospital

Patricia didn't have special gifts. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you protocol templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action on root cause approaches

Her quote: "I thought I needed to be a functional medicine doctor. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START bridging the gap."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Patricia used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful integrative health coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + self-care (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a hospital. You're building an integrative practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning learning (before anyone needs you)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that addresses root causes?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "integrative business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year watching patients not get better
✗ Staying in a healthcare system that frustrates you
✗ Watching other coaches step into integrative work
✗ Same burnout next year, same limitations

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $297 = investment back immediately
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in bridging the gap with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week root cause program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to do integrative health work!!" - Patricia, 49
---

Patricia started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if they want a doctor instead?"
• "What if I freeze when discussing protocols?"
• "What if I can't find the root cause?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my former hospital connection!" - Donna, 51

"Finally told my nursing colleagues about my integrative practice. They're so supportive." - Maria, 47

"Raised my prices to $397 and booked 3 people this week." - Carol, 55

These aren't special women with medical degrees.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in Integrative Health in 30 days
• Use done-for-you protocol templates immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ integrative coaches supporting you
• Session templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure out root cause approaches alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your integrative practice by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Integrative Health Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: GROUNDING
Open with a brief centering breath together
"Let's take a moment to settle into this space..."

5-20 min: THE COMPREHENSIVE INTAKE
"Tell me your health story - not just symptoms, but lifestyle, stress, sleep, digestion..."
"When did you last feel truly well?"
"What has conventional care addressed vs. missed?"

20-45 min: THE ROOT CAUSE EXPLORATION
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Gut health assessment
• Inflammation triggers
• Hormonal patterns
• Stress/nervous system
• Nutritional gaps

Guide them through your assessment. Hold space for their story.

45-55 min: INTEGRATION
"What patterns are you noticing?"
Give ONE protocol recommendation for the week ahead.

55-60 min: CLOSE
Gratitude, next session scheduling, and encouragement.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to hold space for ONE root cause discovery.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Root Causes Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY client? Use the 5 Root Causes of chronic health issues.

ROOT CAUSE 1: CHRONIC INFLAMMATION
• Hidden food sensitivities?
• Environmental triggers?
• Inflammatory markers elevated?

ROOT CAUSE 2: GUT DYSBIOSIS
• Digestive symptoms?
• Antibiotic history?
• Bloating, constipation, brain fog?

ROOT CAUSE 3: HORMONAL IMBALANCE
• Thyroid signs?
• Cortisol dysregulation?
• Estrogen/progesterone symptoms?

ROOT CAUSE 4: TOXIC OVERLOAD
• Chemical exposures?
• Heavy metal concerns?
• Detox pathway issues?

ROOT CAUSE 5: NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSREGULATION
• Chronic stress patterns?
• Fight-or-flight stuck?
• Poor vagal tone signs?

Score each root cause 1-10. The HIGHEST score is where you start.

Example: Client scores Inflammation 6, Gut 9, Hormones 5, Toxins 4, Nervous System 7
→ Start with GUT. That's your primary focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately and feel like you SEE their whole picture.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Root Causes assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Root Cause Program

Stop selling single consultations. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, gets info, doesn't implement
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep root cause work = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real protocol adherence
• Built-in accountability for lifestyle changes
• You become their integrative health guide
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income from root cause work

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK ROOT CAUSE PROGRAM:

Week 1: Discovery + Comprehensive Assessment
Week 2: Root Cause Deep Dive + Initial Protocol
Week 3: Implementation Support + Adjustments
Week 4: Progress Review + Sustainability Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something meaningful:
• "The Root Cause Reset"
• "The Integrative Healing Journey"
• "The Whole Health Transformation"

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to do that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose conditions
• Prescribe medications or supplements therapeutically
• Tell someone to stop their medications
• Order lab tests (unless specifically credentialed)
• Claim to "cure" or "treat" diseases
• Replace their physician's care

✅ YOU CAN:
• Educate on nutrition and lifestyle factors
• Discuss how diet affects inflammation
• Teach stress management techniques
• Recommend general wellness practices
• Review their labs WITH them (not diagnose from them)
• Suggest they discuss specific tests with their doctor
• Share evidence-based integrative information

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"I recommend discussing this with your doctor. What I can share is how lifestyle factors might be playing a role..."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as part of their healthcare team.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "Your thyroid is clearly off"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds like it could involve thyroid function. Have you had that checked with your doctor recently? I'd love to see those results so we can look at lifestyle support together."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "I recommend discussing this with your doctor" phrase 5 times.

        day: 19, gap: "handling-skeptics", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Is This Evidence-Based?"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Is this real science?"
"My doctor says supplements are worthless"
"I only trust conventional medicine"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE BRIDGE
"I hear you. I actually come from a conventional background myself. What I do is bridge the gap - I work WITH your doctor's care and add evidence-based lifestyle factors that medicine doesn't always have time to address. Things like nutrition, sleep, stress management - all backed by research."

SCRIPT 2: THE EVIDENCE
"Great question! Functional nutrition and lifestyle medicine are now recognized by major medical institutions. Harvard, Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins all have integrative medicine departments. What I focus on are the modifiable lifestyle factors that research shows impact chronic conditions."

SCRIPT 3: THE COLLABORATION
"Your skepticism is healthy. I never ask anyone to choose between me and their doctor. I work alongside medical care. We focus on what you eat, how you sleep, how you manage stress - all things your doctor would approve of but doesn't have time to coach you through."

NEVER SAY:
"Doctors don't know everything"
"Conventional medicine is the problem"
"You should stop your medications"

Position yourself as COMPLEMENTARY, not alternative.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

    // Day 20
    {
        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Integrative Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're making progress on your root causes. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who's frustrated with their health and hasn't found answers? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them breakthroughs first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (quality supplement sample, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been dealing with [health issue] and haven't found answers. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if integrative coaching could help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private integrative community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in integrative health coaching, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where integrative coaching gets real.

        day: 23, gap: "fear-audit", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring integrative health coaches:
• "What if doctors think I'm overstepping?"
• "What if I fail publicly after leaving clinical work?"
• "What if my healthcare colleagues judge me?"
• "What if I'm not clinical enough for root cause work?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone without prescribing?"
• "What if I'm being naive about bridging the gap?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if doctors think I'm overstepping?"
Worst case: A doctor dismisses my work
What I'd do: Find doctors who appreciate collaboration
Cost of fear winning: Another year in a system that frustrates me, never bridging the gap

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of a few skeptics.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
