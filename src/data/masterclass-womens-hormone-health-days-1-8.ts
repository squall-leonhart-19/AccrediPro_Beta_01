TODAY'S LESSON: Your Hormone Story Is Your Superpower

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need to be an endocrinologist. You don't need 10 years of medical training. You don't need a nursing degree.

Your STORY - your perimenopause nightmare, your brain fog battle, your weight gain frustration, your mood swings, your sleepless nights - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather get hormone advice from a 28-year-old who read about menopause in a textbook... or a 49-year-old who actually LIVED through it?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MISSION.
Your "struggle" becomes your SPECIALTY.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 hormone struggles you've experienced. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Hormone Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE GYM FRIEND - The woman who mentioned she can't lose weight no matter what she does

2️⃣ THE CHURCH/BOOK CLUB FRIEND - Someone who's been complaining about hot flashes and brain fog

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S FRIEND - Your sister's friend going through perimenopause alone

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been struggling with [their symptom]. I'm building my hormone health practice and looking for 3 women to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute hormone chat?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Hormone Knowledge Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I know more"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't follow the protocol
❌ FREE clients cancel appointments
❌ FREE clients don't track their symptoms
❌ FREE clients don't get results

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the food journals
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Hormone Assessment: $97-$150
• 4-Week Hormone Reset: $297-$397
• 3-Month Hormone Transformation: $997-$1,497

Your knowledge about hormones is LIFE-CHANGING. Charge accordingly.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Health history, current symptoms, medications, hormone concerns

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a doctor. This is hormone health education and lifestyle coaching, not medical advice."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You educate on nutrition and lifestyle for hormone support, NOT diagnose conditions or prescribe HRT

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Hormone Health Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for perimenopause, menopause, thyroid, hormonal weight gain
📌 At YMCA, church groups, book clubs — complaining about hot flashes
📌 Looking for someone who actually LISTENS and UNDERSTANDS

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join perimenopause/menopause groups. Share your story. No pitching.
2️⃣ REFERRAL CARDS - Leave at gyms, yoga studios, women's health clinics
3️⃣ LOCAL TALKS - Speak at church, library, women's groups about "Hormones After 40"
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect and listen.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for perimenopause or menopause. Introduce yourself.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to coach about hormones?"
"What if I don't know enough?"
"I'm not a doctor — can I really help?"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to be an endocrinologist. You need to know MORE than your client. You do.

🔥 Women trust someone who's LIVED through perimenopause more than someone who read about it.

🔥 Your age and experience is an ADVANTAGE. What 30-year-old understands hot flashes at 3am?

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have KILLED for the hormone knowledge you have now?

YES → You're qualified to help someone 5 years behind you.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now about hormones that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
