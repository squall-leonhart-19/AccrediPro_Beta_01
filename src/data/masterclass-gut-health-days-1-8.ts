TODAY'S LESSON: Your Gut Story Is Your Superpower

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a medical degree. You don't need 10 years of nutrition training. You don't need to be a gastroenterologist.

Your STRUGGLE - your years of bloating, your bathroom anxiety, your food fear - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about IBS in a textbook... or someone who actually LIVED through the bloating, the bathroom panic, the canceled plans - and found their way back to normal?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "broken gut" becomes your BREAKTHROUGH.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 gut health struggles you've overcome. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Gut Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE GYM/YOGA FRIEND - The woman who's always complaining about bloating

2️⃣ THE COWORKER - Someone who's seen you bring special lunches or heard you talk about food sensitivities

3️⃣ THE FAMILY FRIEND - Your sister's coworker, daughter's friend who mentioned their digestive issues

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been dealing with some gut stuff. I'm building my coaching practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation about what's going on?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Gut Healing Work Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I'm more qualified"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't show up to calls
❌ FREE clients don't follow the protocols
❌ FREE clients don't heal
❌ FREE clients make you resent your calling

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the elimination diet
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION to their gut.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week Gut Reset: $297-$397
• 3-Month Digestive Restoration: $997-$1,497

Gut health coaching is VALUABLE. Charging for it is necessary.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

        ]
    },

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Health history, current symptoms, medications, goals

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a doctor or dietitian. This is gut health coaching, not medical treatment. Always consult your physician."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You educate on gut health, NOT diagnose or treat medical conditions

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

📅 CALENDLY (free) - Clients book themselves
💳 STRIPE/PAYPAL (free) - Get paid online
📝 GOOGLE DOCS (free) - Food diaries, notes, protocols

THAT'S IT. 4 free tools.

You can run a $3k/month gut health practice with these.

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Women Who Need Gut Healing

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for IBS, bloating, SIBO, gut health
📌 At yoga studios, wellness centers, health food stores
📌 Suffering in SILENCE - embarrassed to talk about their issues

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join gut health groups. Add value. Answer questions. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every woman you help tells 3 others (gut problems spread by whisper!)
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at wellness centers, health stores, women's groups
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect and listen to their gut stories.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for gut health or IBS. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to coach gut health?"
"What if I don't know enough about the microbiome?"
"I'm not a real health professional"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to know everything. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD of your client.

🔥 Your EXPERIENCE is your gift. Clients don't want a textbook - they want someone REAL who healed themselves.

🔥 Your gut journey is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know about gut health now that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
