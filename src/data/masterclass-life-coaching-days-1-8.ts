TODAY'S LESSON: Your Story Is Your Superpower

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a perfect life. You don't need to have it all figured out. You don't need a psychology degree.

Your STORY - your struggles, your breakthroughs, your transformation - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about feeling stuck in a book... or someone who actually LIVED through it and found their way forward?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "breakdown" becomes your BREAKTHROUGH.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 major life transitions or challenges you've overcome. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE WORK FRIEND - The woman who always comes to you for career advice

2️⃣ THE LIFE-IN-TRANSITION FRIEND - Someone going through divorce, empty nest, or career change

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S FRIEND - Your sister's coworker, daughter's friend who feels stuck

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been going through a lot lately. I'm building my life coaching practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Transformation Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I'm more experienced"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't show up
❌ FREE clients don't do the work
❌ FREE clients don't transform
❌ FREE clients make you resent your calling

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the work
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week Transformation: $297-$397
• 3-Month Breakthrough Program: $997-$1,497

Life transformation is VALUABLE. Charging for it is an act of service.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Background, goals, current life situation

✅ 2. COACHING AGREEMENT - "I am not a therapist. This is life coaching, not mental health treatment."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You facilitate life goals and transformation, NOT diagnose or treat mental illness

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

📎 Downloads in Resources:
• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Coaching Agreement Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Ideal Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for women in transition, career change, personal growth
📌 At book clubs, networking events, church groups
📌 Looking for someone they TRUST

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join groups for women 40+. Add value. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every person you help tells 3 others
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at womens groups, libraries, corporate lunch & learns
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect authentically.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for women in life transitions. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to coach anyone?"
"What if I don't have all the answers?"
"I'm not a real coach"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to be perfect. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

🔥 Your REALNESS is your gift. Clients don't want a guru - they want someone AUTHENTIC.

🔥 Your transformation is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
