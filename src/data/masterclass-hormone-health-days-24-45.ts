TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Entertainment

You know a LOT now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find hormone coaching clients
• How to price
• How to run sessions using the H.O.R.M.O.N.E. method
• How to get referrals
• What to say, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE woman about your hormone practice
• Set up Calendly
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about your hormone journey
• Complete your intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence.

Stop learning. Start DOING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 months. After they have ANY breakthrough.
• "I slept through the night for the first time in months!"
• "My hot flashes are down to twice a day instead of ten!"
• "I finally have energy in the afternoon!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's amazing! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], I felt [exhausted/hot-flashing/foggy]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook posts
• Discovery call prep ("Read what my clients say...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE with hormone stuff (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help women thrive through perimenopause and menopause - naturally"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"After suffering through years of hot flashes, night sweats, and brain fog, I found what works..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Hormone Reset Program - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes from clients
Even if informal. Even if from friends you've helped.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Healthy Boundaries With Hormone Clients

As you help more women, you'll encounter:
• "Can I text you at 3am when I have a hot flash?"
• "I know we're done but just one more hormone question..."
• "Can we do a call this weekend?"
• "I need you to be available for my anxiety spikes"

Setting boundaries isn't unhelping. It's ESSENTIAL for sustainable hormone coaching.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to messages within 24-48 hours during business hours. For medical emergencies, please contact your doctor or go to urgent care."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold coaching sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-4pm. I protect my evenings for my own hormone health."

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on lifestyle support for hormones - sleep, stress, nutrition, movement. For medical concerns, please contact your doctor."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I check messages once per day to protect my own energy. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for Women with Hormone Chaos

You have kids. Or grandkids. Or aging parents. Or a job. Or your own hormone symptoms. Or all of the above.

Time AND energy are limited. Here's how to make it work:

THE BATCH METHOD:

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting), batch similar tasks:

• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon, create a week's worth of posts
• SESSION DAY: Stack all your coaching sessions on 2 days
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, scheduling, invoicing all at once

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your hormone business:
• 5:30-6:30am morning work (if you're up anyway with cortisol spikes)
• 12:00-12:30pm lunch break
• 8:00-9:00pm after kids are settled (if evening energy is good)

These are YOURS. No guilt.

THE 80/20 RULE:

20% of your activities create 80% of results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, client sessions, referral asks
Low ROI: Scrolling Instagram, "researching" endlessly, reorganizing files

Do MORE of the 20%. Ignore the rest.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating this as a HOBBY or a MISSION?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

HOBBY:
• Help friends and family with hormone tips for free
• No pressure to get clients
• Learn at your own pace
• Maybe make some side income eventually

MISSION:
• Building an actual hormone coaching practice
• Helping women consistently
• Getting paying clients
• Replacing or supplementing your income
• Doing this for REAL

Both are valid.

But only one leads to the impact you're actually craving.

If you're choosing MISSION...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself. Which are you choosing?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating hormone coaching as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find clients (yoga, church, Facebook groups, referrals)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 programs)
✅ You know how to run sessions (H.O.R.M.O.N.E. method)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, scope of practice)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to market (Facebook, local, word of mouth)
✅ You know how to handle imposter syndrome
✅ You know your scope of practice
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonials

You have EVERYTHING you need...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for hormone coaching:

🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification provides documentation of your training and competence

💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified Hormone Health Coach" vs "someone who knows about hormones"

🙏 CREDIBILITY: Certification removes client skepticism - especially important when discussing their bodies

👥 CLIENT TRUST: Women choose certified practitioners for hormone support - they want to know you're trained

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified hormone coaches charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have passion.
With the credential, you have a PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Math That Changes Everything

Let's do the math together...

CAREER ACCELERATOR INVESTMENT: $297

YOUR FIRST CLIENT:
• 4-Week Hormone Reset Program = $297
• ONE client = Investment recovered ✅

YOUR THIRD CLIENT:
• 3 x $297 = $891
• Profit after investment: $594

YOUR FIRST YEAR (Conservative):
• 2 clients/month x 12 months = 24 clients
• 24 x $297 = $7,128
• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our hormone coaching graduates are actually doing.

Patricia started 10 months ago. She now makes $5,000/month.
Sandra started 6 months ago. She makes $2,600/month.
Denise started 4 months ago. She just hit $1,200/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are.

The difference? They saw the math and made the decision.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 hormone coaching clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Patricia - From Exhausted Teacher to $5,000/Month Hormone Coach

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Patricia joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 53 years old, elementary teacher for 25 years
• Hot flashes during parent conferences
• Waking up at 3am soaked in sweat EVERY night
• Brain fog so bad she forgot student names
• Doctor said "just take HRT" with no explanation

THE TURNING POINT:
• Found a hormone health coach who helped her understand her body
• Realized "this is what I'm meant to do"
• "If I can help other women avoid suffering alone like I did..."

NOW (10 months later):
• $5,000/month income (part-time, 12 hours/week)
• 10 active clients
• Referral waitlist
• Transitioning out of teaching
• "I finally feel ALIVE. I'm helping women thrive, not just survive."

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 3 years waking up at 3am, crying, thinking this was just my life now. If I'd found hormone coaching sooner... but I'm here now. Don't wait. Women are suffering alone right now. Go help them."

Patricia is real. Her results are real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Watch Patricia's full story in the Resources section.

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started...

You can have all the hormone knowledge in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone.

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - pricing, hormone questions, client struggles
• Real-time feedback and guidance
• Never feel stuck alone

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Session templates for hormone coaching
• Intake forms with hormone-specific questions
• Email scripts
• Social media posts about hormone health
• All customized for hormone coaching

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified hormone health coaches
• Share wins and challenges
• Accountability partners
• Referral network

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me
• Personalized guidance
• Help when you're stuck

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT.

I tried to do this alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got a mentor, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with your #1 question or struggle right now. I'll help you.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping You

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR:

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
I get it. Money feels tight. Here's the truth: $297 is ONE hormone coaching client. If you can't find ONE woman struggling with hormones with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my graduates. They have kids, jobs, aging parents, AND their own hormone symptoms. They found 5-10 hours/week. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY. If helping women matters, you'll make time.

😰 "I'M NOT READY"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Patricia wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting.

👨 "MY FAMILY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND"
Then show them the math. 2 clients = $594. 24 clients/year = $7,128. Show them this is a business decision AND a mission to help women.

🤔 "WHAT IF I FAIL?"
What if you succeed? What if this is your purpose? The only guaranteed failure is watching women suffer alone when you could help.

Which one is YOUR objection?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with YOUR #1 concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it later.

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you.

The women making $3K-$6K/month helping with hormones aren't superhuman. They just DECIDED and ACTED when the window was open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Future Self

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's a hormone client booking confirmation
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,400 came in this week
• You're sitting in your home office (finally set up the way you wanted)
• You just finished a session and your client says "I slept through the night for the first time in months"
• You look at your calendar - only working 12 hours this week
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel ENERGIZED. You feel ALIGNED.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our hormone coaching graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Patricia was crying at 3am, soaked in sweat.
Now she makes $5,000/month and helps women thrive through menopause.

6 months ago, Sandra thought she was "too hormonal" to help anyone.
Now she has 8 clients and a waiting list.

You are 6 months away from a completely different life.

The question is: Will you answer the call?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today?

6 days left.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of women:

THE WAIT TRAP:
"I'll do it next month..."
"After my hormones calm down..."
"When things settle..."
"When I have more energy..."

Things never calm down. Hormones never fully settle. There's never a perfect time. The women who wait usually end up in the same exhausted frustration a year later, wishing they'd started.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up but forgot" → Paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Life got in the way" → Stayed stuck for another year while women suffered alone

You've invested 39 days. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed
✅ Skills for running hormone coaching sessions
✅ Systems for getting clients
✅ Knowledge for helping women with hormones
✅ Community of women supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY hormone materials. Join weekly calls. Build your real practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out the rest yourself. Always valid.

OPTION 3: Wait
Let life get busy. Forget about this. Come back in 6 months when you're "ready." (Most people choose this. Most people stay stuck.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest.

The women making $3K-$6K/month helping with hormones didn't have special powers. They DECIDED and ACTED.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage, I almost didn't take the leap. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next month"
• "I need to save more"
• "What if nobody wants hormone coaching?"
• "Who am I to help with hormones?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became confident.
Not because I had all the answers.
Not because I felt "ready."

But because I DECIDED that helping women was worth more than my fear.

The graduates making $3,000-$6,000/month aren't superhuman. They're not more gifted than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of training. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you do this.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

Sarah 💜`,

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART.

Most people don't make it this far. Most people quit by Day 7.

Not you.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Career Accelerator.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment. I know your hormone story (or at least I can feel it). And I believe you have what it takes to help women for real.

Sister to sister: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your questions.

And let's help women thrive through menopause together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💜

P.S. - If you have ANY questions, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really feel into it:

Do you believe in your mission to help women with hormones?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to do this someday."
Not "maybe if everything goes perfectly."

Do you BELIEVE - deep in your heart - that you can help women thrive through perimenopause and menopause?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and your purpose is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days. I've seen your commitment.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your calling?

48 hours to decide.
