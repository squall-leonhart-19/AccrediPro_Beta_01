        "backstory": "Spent 22 years as an ER nurse. Loved saving lives but my nervous system was shot. I was numb to everything - good and bad. A friend dragged me to a Reiki session after my second marriage fell apart. I didn't believe in it but something happened on that table that I still can't fully explain. I felt emotions I'd suppressed for decades. I cried for three days straight. Then I felt PEACE for the first time in years. I knew I had to learn how to give this to others.",
        "dramaticMoment": "I was charting at 3am after losing a 42-year-old mother of three. I looked at my hands - the same hands that just did CPR - and thought 'These hands are meant for more than this.' I went home, found a Reiki training, and enrolled before I could talk myself out of it. Six months later I got my first client. Six months after that, I handed in my resignation. 🥹",

        "videoTestimonialScript": "Hi, I'm Maya. Two years ago I was an ER nurse, emotionally dead inside after 22 years of trauma. I couldn't feel joy, couldn't feel pain, couldn't feel anything. Then I tried Reiki and everything changed. I felt things I'd suppressed for decades. Now I help other women - especially healthcare workers - find that same peace. Last month I made over five thousand dollars working part-time from my healing room. If you feel numb, burnt out, or like something is missing... Reiki might be exactly what you need."
