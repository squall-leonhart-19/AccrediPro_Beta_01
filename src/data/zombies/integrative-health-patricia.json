        "backstory": "RN for 20 years. I loved nursing but felt like I was putting band-aids on bullet wounds. Patients kept coming back with the same chronic issues - diabetes, autoimmune conditions, fatigue that no test could explain. I'd discharge them with more medications, knowing deep down they needed something different. The system was treating symptoms, not root causes. I started studying functional medicine and nutrition on my own time, and suddenly everything clicked.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My wake-up call was watching Margaret, a patient I'd cared for repeatedly over 3 years. Same issues, more medications, getting worse each admission. She looked at me and said 'Why can't anyone just HELP me?' I went home and cried for an hour. That night I knew I had to find another way. There HAD to be a bridge between conventional medicine and true healing. When I discovered integrative health coaching, I finally found that bridge.",
        "transformation": "From frustrated RN watching patients revolve through the system without real healing - to $4,800/month integrative health coach helping women get to the ROOT of their health issues by combining conventional and holistic approaches.",
        "incomeStory": "$4,800/month working 18 hours/week. Started by helping nurses from my hospital who were burned out and chronically ill themselves. Now I have 14 regular clients - mostly women 40-55 with complex health issues that conventional medicine couldn't fully address. Left hospital nursing 6 months ago and never looked back.",

More meds, more symptoms, more frustration. [PAUSE - emotional] My breaking point was a patient who asked me 'Why can't anyone just help me?' I didn't have an answer. When I found integrative health coaching, everything changed. Now I bridge conventional and holistic approaches. Last month I made forty-eight hundred dollars working part-time. If you're in healthcare and you feel that frustration... I understand. There's a better way. You're in the right place."
