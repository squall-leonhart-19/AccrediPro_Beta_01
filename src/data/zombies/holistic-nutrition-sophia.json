        "backstory": "Autoimmune warrior for 15 years. Hashimoto's, rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, chronic fatigue that made me feel 80 years old. Doctors kept adding medications but never asked what I was EATING. I felt like a pharmaceutical experiment gone wrong. My body was attacking itself and nobody could tell me why or how to stop it.",
        "dramaticMoment": "At 45, I was taking 7 different medications every single day. Immunosuppressants, thyroid meds, anti-inflammatories, antidepressants (for the fatigue they said), and more. One morning I lined them all up on my kitchen counter and just cried. This couldn't be the rest of my life. I refused to accept it. That same week, a friend told me about anti-inflammatory eating. Within 3 months of changing my food, I was off 4 medications. FOOD did what pills couldn't. 🥗",
        "transformation": "From medication-dependent woman with autoimmune issues who felt broken and hopeless → To certified holistic nutritionist making $4,700/month helping women heal their bodies through food as medicine.",
        "incomeStory": "$4,700/month working 18 hours/week. Started with a free anti-inflammatory meal planning session for women in my church. Now I have 14 regular clients and a 6-week group program that runs quarterly. Left my desk job 10 months ago and my inflammation markers have never been better.",

Doctors kept adding pills but nobody talked about food. When I finally learned about anti-inflammatory nutrition, everything changed. Within months I was off most of my medications. [PAUSE - emotional] Food gave me my life back. Now I help other women find what I found. Last month I made forty-seven hundred dollars working part-time. If you're watching this and you're struggling with inflammation, chronic issues, food confusion... I understand. And there IS a way to heal. You're in the right place."
