        "backstory": "Corporate HR director for 18 years. I was the go-to person everyone came to for advice - career pivots, salary negotiations, work-life balance, personal struggles. I had a gift for seeing people's potential before they could see it themselves. But every night I'd drive home feeling like a hypocrite. Here I was, helping 500+ employees design careers they loved while I was stuck in a job that drained my soul. I was playing small because the stable paycheck felt safe. Meanwhile, my own dreams collected dust.",
        "dramaticMoment": "The moment that changed everything? I was conducting my 500th career counseling session. This young woman was crying in my office about feeling stuck in her life, and I heard myself say 'You deserve to build a life you actually WANT, not just one you fell into.' And I thought: WHEN DID I STOP TAKING MY OWN ADVICE? I was everyone's life coach except my own. That night I went home, looked in the mirror, and said out loud: 'Keisha, it's time.' 💫",

But here's the truth - I was stuck too. I was giving advice I wasn't taking myself. [PAUSE - getting real] When I hit my 500th career counseling session, I realized: I was everyone's life coach except my own. Now I help women in their 40s design lives they actually want. Last month I made over five thousand dollars. If you're watching this and you're playing small... I see you. I WAS you. And there's another path. You deserve it."
