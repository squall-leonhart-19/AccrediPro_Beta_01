        "backstory": "Elementary school teacher for 18 years. Loved the kids but my body was falling apart - chronic fatigue, migraines, anxiety that medication barely touched. I tried everything conventional medicine offered. Then a colleague invited me to a Reiki session and I felt something shift that I couldn't explain. Started studying energy healing modalities on my own. Within months, friends and family were asking me to work on them. I realized I was meant to do this, not just for myself but for others carrying invisible pain.",
        "dramaticMoment": "I was in the school bathroom having my third panic attack that week. Hands shaking, couldn't breathe, mascara running down my face. A student knocked on the door asking if I was okay. I looked in the mirror and thought 'I'm supposed to be HELPING these kids and I can't even help myself.' That night I signed up for energy healing training. Something inside me just KNEW. I cried the whole drive home but they were relief tears. 😭",

        "videoTestimonialScript": "Hi, I'm Luna. Two years ago I was an elementary school teacher having panic attacks in the bathroom between classes. I tried every medication, every therapy. Nothing worked until I discovered energy healing. It was like someone turned the lights back on inside me. Now I help other women release the stored trauma and blocked energy that's been making them sick and exhausted. Last month I made almost five thousand dollars working part-time from home. If you feel like something is OFF in your body that doctors can't find... I understand. And energy healing might be exactly what you need."
