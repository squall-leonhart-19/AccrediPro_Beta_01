        "backstory": "Suffered from IBS and bloating for 20 years. Tried every medication, every specialist, every elimination diet that doctors recommended. They all said it was 'just stress' or 'you need to relax more.' I lived in fear of food, afraid to eat at restaurants, afraid to travel, afraid to commit to anything because I never knew when my gut would betray me. I was popping antacids like candy and planning my entire life around bathroom access.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My rock bottom was canceling my daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner - the dinner I was supposed to HOST - because I couldn't leave the bathroom. I sat on that cold tile floor crying while my family celebrated without me. That was the moment I knew I couldn't live like this anymore. I became obsessed with finding real answers. Within 3 months of learning gut health protocols, I was eating foods I hadn't touched in 15 years. Within 6 months, I was completely symptom-free. I got my life back, and now I help other women get theirs back too.",
        "transformation": "From bloated, miserable woman afraid to eat anything, planning life around bathroom access, missing my daughter's events → To certified gut health coach making $5,100/month helping women heal their digestion and finally trust their bodies again.",
        "incomeStory": "$5,100/month working 18 hours/week. Started by helping 3 women from my IBS support group for free. Word spread FAST because gut problems are embarrassing and women want someone who truly understands. Now I have 14 regular clients and a waitlist. Left my desk job 7 months ago.",

[PAUSE - emotional] My lowest point was missing my daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner because I couldn't leave the bathroom. That's when I knew I had to find real answers. When I discovered gut health coaching, everything changed. I healed myself, and now I help other women do the same. Last month I made over five thousand dollars doing work that truly matters. If you're watching this and you're suffering in silence... I understand. There IS a way to heal. You're in the right place."
