        "backstory": "I lost my soul dog, a golden retriever named Biscuit, to cancer when he was only 8 years old. After he passed, I fell into a rabbit hole researching pet nutrition and was SHOCKED by what I learned. The kibble I'd been feeding him for years was full of fillers, preservatives, and ingredients I couldn't pronounce. I started researching what dogs ACTUALLY need to thrive. The more I learned, the more I realized most pet parents have no idea they're slowly poisoning their fur babies with processed pet food. I became obsessed with species-appropriate nutrition.",
        "dramaticMoment": "The moment that changed everything was when the vet looked at me and said 'there's nothing more we can do' for Biscuit. He was only 8. I held him as he crossed the rainbow bridge and promised him - if I'd known about nutrition sooner, maybe I could have given him more years. That guilt haunted me until I realized I could turn it into purpose. I couldn't save Biscuit, but I could help OTHER pet parents give their babies the nutrition they deserve.",

[PAUSE - emotional] I spent months researching and realized the kibble I'd been feeding him was full of garbage. I felt so guilty. But I turned that pain into purpose. Now I help other pet parents understand species-appropriate nutrition so their fur babies can live long, healthy lives. Last month I made over four thousand dollars doing this work. If you love your pets and want to help others... I understand. And this is your sign."
