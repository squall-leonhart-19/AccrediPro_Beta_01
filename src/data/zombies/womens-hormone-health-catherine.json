        "backstory": "Elementary school teacher for 22 years. Loved my job until perimenopause hit at 46 and I couldn't think straight anymore. Brain fog so bad I forgot students' names. Night sweats had me changing sheets at 3am. My doctor said 'it's just menopause, here's some antidepressants.' I wasn't depressed. I was HORMONAL. And nobody would listen. Spent $8,000 on tests and specialists who all said 'your labs are normal.' My labs were NOT normal for ME.",
        "dramaticMoment": "The breaking point was when I had a hot flash during parent-teacher conferences and completely blanked on a child's progress report. A parent asked if I was okay and I burst into tears in front of everyone. I went home that night and googled 'why won't anyone help me with menopause' and fell down a rabbit hole of hormone health education. Within 3 months of working with a hormone health coach, I felt like myself again. That's when I knew — I have to help other women avoid what I went through. 😭",
        "transformation": "From brain-fogged teacher who couldn't remember student names and was told 'it's just aging' → To certified Women's Hormone Health Specialist making $4,900/month helping women 40+ reclaim their bodies and their sanity.",
        "incomeStory": "$4,900/month working 18 hours/week. Started with free workshops at my church for perimenopausal women. Now I have 11 regular clients and a 6-week group program. Retired from teaching 5 months ago. Best decision of my life.",

        "videoTestimonialScript": "Hi, I'm Catherine. I was a teacher for 22 years and perimenopause almost destroyed my career. Brain fog, night sweats, mood swings — and every doctor told me I was fine. I was NOT fine. [PAUSE] When I finally found hormone health coaching, it changed my life in weeks. Now I help other women avoid the years of suffering I went through. Last month I made almost five thousand dollars working part-time. If you're watching this and your doctor keeps telling you it's just aging — I see you. And there IS help."
