        "backstory": "School counselor for 15 years. ALWAYS felt like something was wrong with me - losing my keys 10 times a day, missing meetings, starting 47 projects and finishing NONE. I was the MESSIEST counselor with the BEST results because I actually UNDERSTOOD my students. But I didn't know WHY. Got diagnosed at 42 after my third job loss in 5 years. Everything finally made sense. The scattered brain, the emotional dysregulation, the time blindness... it wasn't a character flaw. It was ADHD.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My rock bottom was sitting in my car in the school parking lot after being let go AGAIN. They said I was 'disorganized' and 'unreliable.' I SOBBED for two hours. Called my sister and she said 'Mel, have you ever been tested for ADHD?' Three weeks later, I had my diagnosis. I remember reading the results and CRYING - not sad tears, RELIEF tears. I wasn't broken. My brain just works DIFFERENTLY. That was the day everything changed. 🧠💜",
        "transformation": "From scattered, overwhelmed woman who lost 3 jobs and thought she was fundamentally broken → To certified ADHD coach making $4,600/month helping women in their 40s and 50s FINALLY understand their beautiful neurodivergent brains.",
        "incomeStory": "$4,600/month working 18 hours/week. Started with a FREE support group for late-diagnosed women. Now I have 14 regular clients who get me because I GET them. Left traditional counseling 10 months ago. BEST DECISION EVER!! 🚀",

Then at 42, I was finally diagnosed with ADHD. [PAUSE - emotional] Everything made sense. I wasn't broken - my brain just works differently! Now I help other women who got missed. Last month I made over forty-six hundred dollars helping women FINALLY understand themselves. If you're watching this and you've always felt different, like something was wrong with you... I SEE you. And there's a name for what you have - and it's not a flaw. It's actually your SUPERPOWER once you learn to work with it."
