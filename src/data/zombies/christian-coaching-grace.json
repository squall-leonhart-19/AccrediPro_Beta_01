        "backstory": "Pastor's wife for 24 years. Always the one organizing potlucks, leading women's Bible study, counseling struggling couples after service. Everyone said I had 'the gift' for helping people find their way back to faith. But I never got paid. Never got trained. Just gave and gave until I felt like an empty vessel myself. My identity was 'pastor's wife' not 'Grace.' I was terrified to want more because wanting something for MYSELF felt selfish and unbiblical.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My wake-up call came when a young mom I'd been mentoring for 3 years said 'Grace, you should do this professionally. You've helped me more than any counselor I've paid.' I laughed it off at first. But that night I prayed about it and felt God whisper: 'Your gifts are meant to be a blessing AND a livelihood. Stewardship isn't just about giving - it's about growing.' I cried for an hour. I'd been hiding behind 'servant's heart' when really I was just scared to step into my calling. 🙏",
        "transformation": "From unpaid church volunteer running on empty → To certified Christian life coach earning $4,900/month helping women align their faith with their God-given purpose.",
        "incomeStory": "$4,900/month working 12 hours/week. Started with one woman from my old Bible study who paid $197 for 4 sessions. Word spread through the congregation. Now I have 10 regular clients, mostly through church connections and referrals. My husband finally sees this as a MINISTRY not just a hobby.",

        "videoTestimonialScript": "Hi, I'm Grace. For 24 years I was 'the pastor's wife.' Always serving, always counseling, always giving. But never getting paid, never getting trained. I felt called to help women but I thought wanting a career felt... selfish. Unbiblical even. [PAUSE - emotional] Then God showed me that stewardship isn't just about giving - it's about growing what He's given us. The Proverbs 31 woman ran a BUSINESS. Now I help women align their faith with their purpose, and last month I earned almost five thousand dollars doing it. If you're watching this and you feel that calling but you're scared it's not 'Christian enough' to want more... I understand. And God has MORE for you. You're in the right place."
