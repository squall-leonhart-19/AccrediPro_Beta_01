        "backstory": "ICU nurse for 25 years. Worked nights, holidays, every crisis you can imagine. I used to be the nurse everyone wanted on their shift because I could handle ANYTHING. But handling everything for everyone else meant handling nothing for myself. Compassion fatigue hit me like a freight train around year 18. I was going through the motions but feeling absolutely nothing. My marriage almost ended. My kids said I was 'never really there' even when I was home. I was drowning in PPE and protocols but completely disconnected from why I became a nurse in the first place.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My breaking point was a night shift where we lost three patients in four hours. I held it together for the families, for my team, for everyone. Then I went to the supply closet, sat on a box of IV fluids, and just... broke. Sobbing. Shaking. I couldn't go back out there. A CNA found me and covered for me while I pulled myself together. That night I sat in my car for two hours before driving home. I knew I couldn't do bedside nursing anymore, but I had NO IDEA what else a nurse could even do. 25 years of skills and I felt completely trapped. 💔",
        "transformation": "From burnt-out ICU nurse having panic attacks before every shift → To certified nurse coach making $5,400/month helping healthcare workers find balance, prevent burnout, and discover second careers that use their clinical skills differently.",
        "incomeStory": "$5,400/month working 18 hours/week. Started by coaching my own coworkers through their burnout (for free at first, just coffee talks). Now I have 9 regular clients - mostly nurses, some physicians, a few NPs. Just got my first referral from an Employee Assistance Program. Left bedside 10 months ago and I've never felt more like a NURSE than I do now.",

[PAUSE] Compassion fatigue, moral injury, whatever you want to call it... I hit a wall. I found myself sobbing in a supply closet one night after losing three patients and I knew something had to change. [PAUSE - emotional] I thought nursing was all I knew. Turns out, those same skills - listening, assessing, supporting people through their hardest moments - they translate perfectly to coaching. Now I help other nurses find their way before they hit the wall like I did. Last month I made fifty-four hundred dollars working part-time. If you're a nurse watching this and you're burning out... I see you. There's another way."
