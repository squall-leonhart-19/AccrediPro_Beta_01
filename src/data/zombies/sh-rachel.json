        "backstory": "Corporate marketing VP for 16 years. Had the corner office, the salary, the awards. But I was dead inside. Cried in my car before walking into the office every morning. Therapist said I was 'high functioning' and 'doing great.' I was NOT doing great. I was spiritually bankrupt and nobody in my life could see it because I was so good at performing.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My wake-up call was a panic attack in a board meeting that sent me to the ER. They ran every test. Heart was fine. Brain was fine. But I wasn't fine. I remember lying in that hospital bed thinking 'I have everything and I feel nothing.' That's when I knew the wound wasn't in my body or my mind. It was in my spirit. A friend recommended a spiritual healing practitioner and within 6 weeks I felt something I hadn't felt in years: HOPE. 😭",

The ER said I was fine. But I was NOT fine. [PAUSE - emotional] I was spiritually empty. When I found spiritual healing, it was like someone turned the lights back on. Now I help other women find what I found. Last month I made over five thousand dollars working part-time. If you're watching this and you feel that emptiness... I understand. And there IS a way through. You're in the right place."
