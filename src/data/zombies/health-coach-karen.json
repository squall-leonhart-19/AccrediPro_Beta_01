        "backstory": "Struggled with my weight for 25 years. Every diet, every program, every miracle pill. Lost the same 30 pounds at least 10 times. I was the queen of yo-yo dieting. My metabolism was destroyed, my energy was in the basement, and I was exhausted all the time. But I kept showing up for everyone else - my kids, my husband, my job - while my own health fell apart. Nobody could tell how bad I felt because I kept it all together on the outside.",
        "dramaticMoment": "My doctor told me I was pre-diabetic at 45. I was only 45 and my body was already giving up on me. He said if I didn't change something NOW, I'd be on medication for the rest of my life. I remember sitting in my car in the parking lot sobbing. That was my wake-up call. I couldn't keep doing what I was doing. Something had to fundamentally change - not another diet, but my whole relationship with food and my body.",
        "transformation": "From pre-diabetic, exhausted mom on the yo-yo diet rollercoaster -> To certified health coach who lost 60 pounds naturally and now makes $4,400/month helping other women transform their health.",
        "incomeStory": "$4,400/month working about 12-15 hours/week. Started by helping 3 friends from my neighborhood who saw my transformation and begged me to share my secret. Now I have 8 regular clients and referrals coming in every week. Quit my part-time admin job 6 months ago.",

I'd yo-yo dieted my whole adult life and my body was finally giving up on me. [PAUSE - emotional] That day changed everything. I decided to actually learn how the body works instead of chasing another quick fix. I lost 60 pounds. My A1C is completely normal. And now? I help other women do what I did. Last month I made forty-four hundred dollars helping women get their energy and health back. If you're tired of the diet rollercoaster, there's a better way. You're in the right place."
