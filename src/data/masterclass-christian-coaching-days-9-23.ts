Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my Christian coaching practice while still working another job, raising kids, and serving at church. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Grace...

Grace joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago.

Her situation:
• 52 years old
• Pastor's wife for 24 years
• Burned out from unpaid ministry work
• Felt "called" but guilty about wanting to get paid
• Scared of what the church would think

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started with one woman from Bible study
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 4 more clients through church referrals
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 10 hours/week
Month 8: $4,900/month with a waitlist, husband finally sees it as ministry

Grace didn't have special gifts. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just served and trusted God

Her quote: "I thought wanting to get paid was unbiblical. Turns out stewardship means GROWING what God gave me, not burying it."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Grace used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful Christian coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + prayer time (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporation. You're building a ministry-practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning devotion time (extend it for business)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real families and church commitments do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for the calling God placed on my heart?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "kingdom business time." Just block them.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is uncertain. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year feeling called but stuck
✗ Staying in unfulfilling work that doesn't honor your gifts
✗ Watching other women step into their calling
✗ Same frustration next year, same "someday"

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your God-given calling with a clear return path.

"The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance." - Proverbs 21:5

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week program. I was shaking and praising God! I'm actually getting PAID to serve women in their faith journey!!" - Grace, 52
---

Grace started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if people think I'm being unbiblical?"
• "What if I freeze during a session?"
• "What if they don't grow in their faith?"

She did it anyway. She trusted God.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my pastor's wife's referral!" - Donna, 51

"Finally told my church about my practice. They're so supportive." - Theresa, 47

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 2 women this week." - Carol, 55

These aren't super-spiritual women with special anointing.

They're women who DECIDED and then TRUSTED GOD.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you materials immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women of faith supporting you
• Session templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your calling by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what God is calling you to.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Christian Coaching Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: OPENING PRAYER
Open with prayer together. Invite the Holy Spirit into the session.
"Lord, guide our conversation today..."

5-15 min: THE CHECK-IN
"How is your heart and spirit today?"
"What's been weighing on you this week?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how aligned do you feel with your purpose?"

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Clarifying God's calling on her life
• Working through a faith struggle
• Aligning decisions with biblical values
• Processing a life transition

Guide her through reflection. Hold sacred space.

40-50 min: INTEGRATION
"What is God showing you today?"
Give ONE practice for the week ahead (scripture, prayer prompt, journaling).

50-60 min: CLOSE
Gratitude, next session, and a closing blessing.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to hold space for ONE step forward in faith.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The G.R.A.C.E. Method Assessment

Want a simple framework to help ANY client? Use the G.R.A.C.E. Method.

G - GROUND IN SCRIPTURE
• What scriptures speak to her situation?
• What biblical truths can anchor her?
• Where does she need God's Word?

R - REFLECT ON CALLING
• What is God calling her to?
• Where does she feel pulled?
• What gifts has He given her?

A - ALIGN WITH PURPOSE
• Are her daily choices aligned with her calling?
• What's out of alignment?
• Where is there disconnect?

C - CLARIFY NEXT STEPS
• What is ONE thing she can do this week?
• What decision needs to be made?
• What step is God asking her to take?

E - ENCOURAGE ACTION
• Accountability and prayer
• Follow-up and support
• Celebration of progress

Score each area 1-10. The LOWEST score is where you start.

Example: Client scores Ground 8, Reflect 4, Align 6, Clarify 5, Encourage 7
→ Start with REFLECT. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Biblical.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the G.R.A.C.E. assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Faith Journey Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, feels inspired, old patterns return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real spiritual growth
• Built-in accountability
• You become their faith guide
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable kingdom income

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to do that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose mental health conditions
• Prescribe medications
• Tell someone to stop their meds or therapy
• Replace pastoral counseling or church leadership
• Claim to "heal" mental illness through prayer alone

✅ YOU CAN:
• Facilitate faith-aligned life coaching
• Guide scripture study and application
• Help with purpose and calling discovery
• Pray with and for clients
• Explore biblical decision-making
• Recommend they see a pastor or therapist if needed
• Share your own testimony and faith journey

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If this is feeling like more than coaching, I encourage you to also speak with your pastor or a licensed counselor."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as wise.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You have depression"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds really heavy. Have you considered speaking with a counselor alongside our faith coaching? The combination can be really powerful."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "I encourage you to also speak with a pastor or counselor" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Shouldn't This Be Free If It's Ministry?"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Isn't this just doing what the church does for free?"
"My pastor doesn't charge for counseling"
"Shouldn't ministry be a gift, not a business?"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE PROVERBS 31 RESPONSE
"I hear you. The Proverbs 31 woman served her family AND ran a business. She sold her goods and provided for her household. Ministry and income aren't opposites - stewardship means multiplying what God gave us."

SCRIPT 2: THE WORKER RESPONSE
"Scripture says the worker deserves their wages. Luke 10:7. My training and time have value, just like any profession. This allows me to serve MORE women, not fewer."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"I understand the question. Pastoral counseling is different from life coaching - pastors provide spiritual care to their congregation. I provide focused, one-on-one coaching with accountability and structure. They're complementary, not competing."

NEVER SAY:
"You just don't understand"
"That's an outdated view"
"You're being judgmental"

Position yourself as BIBLICAL and WISE, not defensive.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

    // Day 20
    {
        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so grateful we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE woman in your life who feels lost in her faith or stuck in her purpose? I'd love to help her like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE WOMAN with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them breakthroughs first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (devotional book, candle, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been going through a season of searching. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure, just a conversation."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. God's timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in Christian coaching, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring Christian coaches:
• "What if people think I'm being unbiblical?"
• "What if I fail publicly and embarrass my family?"
• "What if my church judges me?"
• "What if I'm not called enough?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
• "What if I'm being prideful about my gifts?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if people think I'm being unbiblical?"
Worst case: A few people judge me
What I'd do: Find my people who understand stewardship
Cost of fear winning: Another year ignoring my God-given calling, staying stuck

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." - 2 Timothy 1:7

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
