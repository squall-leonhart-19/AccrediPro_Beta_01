Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my life coaching practice while still working full-time in HR, feeling like a hypocrite. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Keisha...

Keisha joined the Career Accelerator 7 months ago.

Her situation:
• 46 years old
• HR Director for 18 years
• Helped 500+ employees with their careers and lives
• Felt like a hypocrite - giving advice she wasn't taking
• Scared to leave the "stable paycheck"

What happened:

Month 1: Got certified, started with 2 former coworkers
Month 2: First paying client ($297 package)
Month 3: 5 more clients through referrals
Month 4: Raised prices to $397, still booking
Month 6: $4,200/month working 18 hours/week
Month 7: $5,300/month with 14 clients, quit corporate

Keisha didn't have special gifts. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I was everyone's life coach except my own. Turns out I just needed permission to take my own advice and actually START."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Keisha used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful life coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 coaching session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 coaching session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + personal growth (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 coaching session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a coaching practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning routine (before anyone needs you)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that transforms lives?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "coaching business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year feeling stuck and unfulfilled
✗ Staying in work that drains you
✗ Watching other women step into their purpose
✗ Same frustration next year, same playing small

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $297 = 100% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your calling with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week transformation program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help women design their lives!!" - Keisha, 46
---

Keisha started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if I don't have all the answers?"
• "What if I freeze during a session?"
• "What if they don't have a breakthrough?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my book club connection!" - Donna, 52

"Finally told my family about my coaching practice. They're so proud of me." - Theresa, 48

"Raised my prices to $397 and booked 3 people this week." - Carol, 54

These aren't special women with supernatural gifts.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you materials immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Session templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your coaching calling by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Life Coaching Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: CONNECTION
Open with a warm greeting and settling in
"How are you feeling today? What's alive for you?"

5-15 min: THE CHECK-IN
"What's been your biggest win this week?"
"What challenge are you facing?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how close are you to your goals?"

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Clarifying a goal
• Breaking through a limiting belief
• Creating an action plan
• Processing a decision

Ask powerful questions. Hold space for reflection.

40-50 min: ACCOUNTABILITY
"What are you committing to this week?"
Give ONE action item they can complete.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Celebrate their insights, confirm next session, send them off empowered.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to facilitate ONE breakthrough.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Core Areas Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY client? Use the 5 Core Areas of life transformation.

CORE AREA 1: CAREER & PURPOSE
• Fulfilled in their work?
• Clear on their calling?
• Using their gifts?

CORE AREA 2: RELATIONSHIPS
• Healthy boundaries?
• Supportive connections?
• Communication skills?

CORE AREA 3: HEALTH & WELLNESS
• Physical energy?
• Mental wellness?
• Self-care routine?

CORE AREA 4: PERSONAL GROWTH
• Learning and evolving?
• Mindset work?
• Limiting beliefs?

CORE AREA 5: FINANCIAL FREEDOM
• Money stress level?
• Relationship with money?
• Goals and plans?

Score each area 1-10. The LOWEST score is where you start.

Example: Client scores Career 4, Relationships 7, Health 6, Growth 5, Money 8
→ Start with CAREER. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Core Areas assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Transformation Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, feels motivated, old patterns return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real change
• Built-in accountability
• You become their transformation partner
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK TRANSFORMATION:

Week 1: Vision + Quick Win
Week 2: Breakthrough + Core Strategy
Week 3: Action + Accountability
Week 4: Integration + Next Level Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something powerful:
• "The Life Redesign Program"
• "The Breakthrough Journey"
• "90 Days to Your Best Life"
• "The Unstuck Transformation"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 4 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to do that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose mental health conditions
• Prescribe medications
• Tell someone to stop their therapy or meds
• Claim to "cure" depression, anxiety, etc.
• Replace licensed mental health care

✅ YOU CAN:
• Facilitate goal-setting and vision work
• Help with accountability and action plans
• Explore limiting beliefs and mindset
• Guide life decisions and transitions
• Hold space for processing emotions
• Recommend they see a therapist if needed
• Share your own transformation story

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If this feels like more than life coaching, I encourage you to also speak with a licensed therapist."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as responsible.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "You have depression"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds really heavy. Have you considered speaking with a therapist alongside our coaching? The combination can be really powerful."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "I encourage you to also speak with a therapist" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Life Coaching Sounds Fluffy"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Isn't life coaching just common sense?"
"My husband thinks this is a waste of money"
"I'm not sure if talking will actually help"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE RESULTS
"I hear you. A lot of people wonder that at first. What I do is very structured - it's about setting clear goals, identifying what's holding you back, and creating accountability to actually follow through. My clients see real, measurable results."

SCRIPT 2: THE ANALOGY
"Think about it like a personal trainer. You COULD work out alone. But a trainer keeps you accountable, sees your blind spots, and gets you results faster. That's what coaching does for your life."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"Your skepticism is actually smart. Let's start with a discovery call so you can experience it firsthand. No pressure - just see if it feels right for you."

NEVER SAY:
"You just don't understand what coaching is"
"You need to be more open-minded"
"This isn't for everyone anyway"

Position yourself as PRACTICAL and RESULTS-ORIENTED, not wishy-washy.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who feels stuck or is going through a big transition? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them breakthroughs first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (coffee gift card, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been going through a big transition. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified as a life coach, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring life coaches:
• "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
• "What if I fail publicly?"
• "What if my family judges me?"
• "What if I don't have all the answers?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
• "What if I'm too old to start something new?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if people think I'm not qualified?"
Worst case: A few people are skeptical
What I'd do: Show them results and testimonials
Cost of fear winning: Another year of playing small, staying stuck

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
