TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Entertainment

You know a LOT now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find clients
• How to price
• How to run healing sessions
• How to get referrals
• What to say, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE person about your practice
• Set up Calendly
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about your journey
• Complete your intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence.

Stop learning. Start DOING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 months. After they have ANY breakthrough.
• "I finally slept peacefully!"
• "I feel connected to myself again!"
• "I released so much grief today!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's so beautiful! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], I felt [spiritually disconnected/lost/empty]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook posts
• Discovery call prep ("Read what my clients say...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help women reconnect with their spiritual center and find inner peace"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"After years of feeling spiritually empty despite external success, I found my way back..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Soul Restoration Journey - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes from clients
Even if informal. Even if from free clients.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Create your 1-page website. Use the template. 30 minutes max.

        day: 27, gap: "boundaries", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Sacred Boundaries With Clients

As you help more people, you'll encounter:
• "Can I text you anytime I'm struggling?"
• "I know we're done but just one more thing..."
• "Can we do a call at 10pm?"
• "I need you to be available for my emergencies"

Setting boundaries isn't unspiritual. It's ESSENTIAL for sustainable sacred work.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to messages within 24-48 hours. For mental health emergencies, please contact a crisis line or therapist."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold sacred sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm. I honor the Sabbath of my practice on weekends."

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on spiritual wellness - meditation, journaling, energy work. For clinical mental health needs, I'll connect you with the appropriate support."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I check messages once per day to protect my own spiritual practice. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

        day: 28, gap: "time-management", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for Busy Women

You have kids. Or grandkids. Or aging parents. Or a job. Or all of the above.

Time is limited. Here's how to make it work:

THE BATCH METHOD:

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting), batch similar tasks:

• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon, create a week's worth of posts
• SESSION DAY: Stack all your healing sessions on 2 days
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, scheduling, invoicing all at once

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your sacred business:
• 5:30-6:00am morning practice (before anyone needs you)
• 12:00-12:30pm lunch break
• 8:00-9:00pm after kids are down

These are YOURS. No guilt.

THE 80/20 RULE:

20% of your activities create 80% of results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, healing sessions, referral asks
Low ROI: Scrolling Instagram, "researching," reorganizing files

Do MORE of the 20%. Ignore the rest.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating this as a HOBBY or a CALLING?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

HOBBY:
• Help friends and family for free
• No pressure to get clients
• Learn at your own pace
• Maybe make some side income eventually

CALLING:
• Building an actual spiritual practice
• Sharing your gifts consistently
• Getting paying clients
• Replacing or supplementing your income
• Doing this for REAL

Both are valid.

But only one leads to the life you're actually yearning for.

If you're choosing CALLING...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself. Which are you choosing?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating this as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find clients (yoga studios, church, referrals)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 programs)
✅ You know how to run sessions (60-min structure)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, disclaimers)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to share your gifts (Facebook, local, word of mouth)
✅ You know how to handle imposter syndrome
✅ You know your scope of practice
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonials

You have EVERYTHING you need...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for spiritual healing:

🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification provides documentation of your training and competence

💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified Spiritual Healing Specialist" vs "someone who does energy stuff"

🙏 GROUNDING: Certification makes your practice feel REAL and structured, not "woo-woo"

👥 CLIENT TRUST: Clients choose certified practitioners - it removes their skepticism

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified practitioners charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have gifts.
With the credential, you have a PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Math That Changes Everything

Let's do the math together...

CAREER ACCELERATOR INVESTMENT: $297

YOUR FIRST CLIENT:
• 4-Week Soul Restoration Journey = $297
• ONE client = Investment recovered ✅

YOUR THIRD CLIENT:
• 3 x $297 = $891
• Profit after investment: $594

YOUR FIRST YEAR (Conservative):
• 2 clients/month x 12 months = 24 clients
• 24 x $297 = $7,128
• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our graduates are actually doing.

Rachel started 8 months ago. She now makes $5,100/month.
Donna started 6 months ago. She makes $2,800/month.
Theresa started 4 months ago. She just hit $1,400/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are.

The difference? They saw the math and made the decision.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Rachel - From Corporate VP to $5,100/Month Doing Sacred Work

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Rachel joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 44 years old, Corporate VP for 16 years
• Crying in her car before work every morning
• Panic attack in a board meeting sent her to ER
• "Spiritually dead" despite external success

THE TURNING POINT:
• Found a spiritual healer who helped her reconnect
• Realized "this is what I'm meant to do"
• "If I can help other women avoid that emptiness..."

NOW (8 months later):
• $5,100/month income (part-time, 12 hours/week)
• 12 active clients
• Waitlist of 5 more
• Quit corporate 6 months ago
• "I finally feel ALIVE. I'm doing work that matters."

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 22 years in a corner office feeling spiritually bankrupt. If I'd found this sooner... but I'm here now. Don't wait. Your soul is calling you. Answer it."

Rachel is real. Her results are real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started...

You can have all the gifts in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone.

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - pricing, clients, struggles
• Real-time feedback and guidance
• Never feel stuck alone

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Session templates
• Intake forms
• Email scripts
• Social media posts
• All customized for spiritual healing

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified spiritual healers
• Share wins and challenges
• Accountability partners
• Referral network

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me
• Personalized guidance
• Help when you're stuck

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT.

I tried to do this alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got a mentor, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with your #1 question or struggle right now. I'll help you.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping You

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR:

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
I get it. Money feels tight. Here's the truth: $297 is ONE client. If you can't find ONE client with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my graduates. They have kids, jobs, aging parents. They found 5-10 hours/week. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY. If your soul is calling you, you'll make time.

😰 "I'M NOT READY"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Rachel wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting.

👨 "MY FAMILY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND"
Then show them the math. 2 clients = $594. 24 clients/year = $7,128. Show them this is a business decision AND a soul calling.

🤔 "WHAT IF I FAIL?"
What if you succeed? What if this is your purpose? The only guaranteed failure is ignoring your calling.

Which one is YOUR objection?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with YOUR #1 concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it later.

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you.

The women who succeed aren't superhuman. They just DECIDE and ACT when the window is open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Future Self

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's a client booking confirmation
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,400 came in this week
• You're sitting in your sacred office space (finally set up the way you wanted)
• You just finished a session and your client is in tears - healing tears
• You look at your calendar - only working 15 hours this week
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel ALIVE. You feel ALIGNED.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Rachel was crying in her car before work.
Now she makes $5,100/month and helps women heal.

6 months ago, Donna thought she was "too old" to follow her calling.
Now she has 8 clients and a waiting list.

You are 6 months away from a completely different life.

The question is: Will you answer the call?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today?

6 days left.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of women:

THE WAIT TRAP:
"I'll do it next month..."
"After the holidays..."
"When things calm down..."
"When I have more money saved..."

Things never calm down. There's never a perfect time. The women who wait usually end up in the same spiritual void a year later, wishing they'd started.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences for your soul.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up but forgot" → Paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Life got in the way" → Stayed spiritually stuck for another year

You've invested 39 days. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed
✅ Skills for running healing sessions
✅ Systems for getting clients
✅ Knowledge for helping people heal
✅ Community of women supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY materials. Join weekly calls. Build your real practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out the rest yourself. Always valid.

OPTION 3: Wait
Let life get busy. Forget about this. Come back in 6 months when you're "ready." (Most people choose this. Most people stay stuck.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest.

The women making $3K-$6K/month didn't have special powers. They DECIDED and ACTED.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage, I almost didn't take the leap. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next month"
• "I need to save more"
• "What if nobody wants my help?"
• "Who am I to do spiritual work?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became confident.
Not because I had all the answers.
Not because I felt "ready."

But because I DECIDED that my calling was worth more than my fear.

The graduates making $3,000-$6,000/month aren't superhuman. They're not more gifted than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of training. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you do this.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

Sarah 💛`,

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART.

Most people don't make it this far. Most people quit by Day 7.

Not you.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Career Accelerator.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment. I know your story (or at least I can feel it). And I believe you have what it takes to do this for real.

Soul to soul: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your questions.

And let's build this together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you have ANY questions, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really feel into it:

Do you believe in your calling?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to do this someday."
Not "maybe if everything goes perfectly."

Do you BELIEVE - deep in your soul - that you can help people and build a healing practice?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and your purpose is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days. I've seen your commitment.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your calling?

48 hours to decide.

Sarah 💛`,
