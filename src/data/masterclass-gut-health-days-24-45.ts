TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Entertainment

You know a LOT about gut health coaching now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find gut health clients
• How to price elimination programs
• How to run gut coaching sessions
• How to get referrals from bloated women
• What to say, what not to say about digestion

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Gut Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE person about their gut struggles
• Set up Calendly for gut reset calls
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about your healing journey
• Complete your gut health intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates gut coaching confidence.

Stop learning. Start HELPING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Gut Health Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING for gut coaching. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 weeks. After they have ANY digestive breakthrough.
• "I wasn't bloated after dinner!"
• "I finally had a normal bathroom day!"
• "I ate bread and felt fine!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's so amazing! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], I struggled with [bloating/IBS/food fear]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook posts
• Discovery call prep ("Read what my clients say...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE with digestion (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Gut Health Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy wellness website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help (women with gut issues)
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer (gut reset program)
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help women heal their digestion and finally feel comfortable in their bodies"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your gut journey
"After 15 years of bloating, food fear, and bathroom anxiety, I found my way back to digestive freedom..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Gut Reset Journey - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes from clients
Even if informal. Even if from free clients with bloating wins.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Gut Health Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple gut health website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

        day: 27, gap: "boundaries", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Healthy Boundaries With Gut Clients

As you help more people with digestion, you'll encounter:
• "Can I text you every time I have a reaction?"
• "I know we're done but I just ate something weird..."
• "Can we do a call at 10pm? I'm having a flare!"
• "I need you to be available for my food emergencies"

Setting boundaries isn't mean. It's ESSENTIAL for sustainable gut coaching.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to messages within 24-48 hours. For severe symptoms, please contact your doctor or go to urgent care."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold gut coaching sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-3pm. I protect my evenings for my own digestive health."

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on gut wellness education - elimination diets, food journaling, lifestyle. For medical concerns, I'll connect you with appropriate care."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I check messages once per day to protect my energy. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 gut coaching boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for Busy Gut Health Coaches

You have kids. Or grandkids. Or aging parents. Or a job. Or your own digestion to manage. Or all of the above.

Time is limited. Here's how to make gut coaching work:

THE BATCH METHOD:

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting), batch similar tasks:

• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon, create a week's worth of gut health posts
• SESSION DAY: Stack all your gut coaching sessions on 2 days
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, scheduling, food diary reviews all at once

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your gut business:
• 6:00-6:30am morning routine (before anyone needs you)
• 12:00-12:30pm lunch break
• 8:00-9:00pm after kids are down

These are YOURS. No guilt.

THE 80/20 RULE:

20% of your activities create 80% of gut coaching results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, gut coaching sessions, referral asks
Low ROI: Scrolling wellness Instagram, "researching" supplements, reorganizing files

Do MORE of the 20%. Ignore the rest.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating gut health coaching as a HOBBY or a CALLING?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

HOBBY:
• Help friends and family with bloating for free
• No pressure to get paying clients
• Learn about gut health at your own pace
• Maybe make some side income eventually

CALLING:
• Building an actual gut health practice
• Helping women heal consistently
• Getting paying clients
• Replacing or supplementing your income
• Doing this for REAL

Both are valid.

But only one leads to the life you're actually yearning for.

If you're choosing CALLING...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself. Which are you choosing for gut health?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating gut coaching as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left For Your Gut Coaching Practice

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find gut health clients (support groups, yoga studios, referrals)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 gut reset programs)
✅ You know how to run sessions (60-min structure)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, disclaimers, scope)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to market (Facebook groups, word of mouth)
✅ You know how to handle imposter syndrome
✅ You know your scope of practice for digestion
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonials

You have EVERYTHING you need for gut health coaching...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for gut health:

🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification provides documentation of your training and competence in digestive wellness

💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified Gut Health Coach" vs "someone who talks about digestion"

🏥 MEDICAL COLLABORATION: Doctors refer to certified coaches - certification opens referral pathways

👥 CLIENT TRUST: Clients choose certified practitioners - especially for something as sensitive as gut health

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified gut coaches charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have knowledge.
With the credential, you have a GUT HEALTH PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Gut Coaching Math That Changes Everything

Let's do the math together...

CAREER ACCELERATOR INVESTMENT: $297

YOUR FIRST GUT RESET CLIENT:
• 4-Week Gut Reset Journey = $297
• ONE client = Investment recovered ✅

YOUR THIRD CLIENT:
• 3 x $297 = $891
• Profit after investment: $594

YOUR FIRST YEAR (Conservative):
• 2 gut clients/month x 12 months = 24 clients
• 24 x $297 = $7,128
• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our gut health graduates are actually doing.

Diana started 7 months ago. She now makes $5,100/month helping women heal.
Michelle started 5 months ago. She makes $2,600/month.
Laura started 4 months ago. She just hit $1,800/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are with gut health.

The difference? They saw the math and made the decision.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 gut clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Diana - From 20 Years of IBS to $5,100/Month Gut Health Coach

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Diana joined the Career Accelerator 7 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 51 years old, suffered from IBS for 20 years
• Doctors told her it was "just stress"
• Missed her daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner - bathroom emergency
• Afraid to eat, constant food anxiety
• Planned entire life around bathroom access

THE TURNING POINT:
• Found gut health protocols that actually worked for her
• Healed herself after decades of suffering
• Realized "If I can heal, I can help other women heal too"

NOW (7 months later):
• $5,100/month income (part-time, 18 hours/week)
• 14 active gut reset clients
• Waitlist of 6 more women
• Quit her desk job 6 months ago
• "I finally feel FREE. I eat without fear and I help women do the same."

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 20 years afraid of food and planning my life around bathrooms. If I'd found this sooner... but I'm here now. Don't wait. Your gut struggle is your gift. Use it to help others heal."

Diana is real. Her gut transformation is real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference For Gut Health Coaches

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started...

You can have all the gut knowledge in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone.

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - gut protocols, tricky clients, pricing
• Real-time feedback and guidance
• Never feel stuck alone with a complex case

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Elimination protocol templates
• Gut health intake forms
• Email scripts for digestive clients
• Social media posts about gut healing
• All customized for gut health coaching

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified gut health coaches
• Share wins and challenging gut cases
• Accountability partners
• Referral network for digestion clients

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me
• Personalized guidance on gut cases
• Help when you're stuck with a complex client

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT.

I tried to do gut coaching alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got a mentor, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping Your Gut Coaching Dream

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR:

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
I get it. Money feels tight. Here's the truth: $297 is ONE gut reset client. If you can't find ONE bloated woman with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my gut coaching graduates. They have kids, jobs, their own digestive issues to manage. They found 5-10 hours/week. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY. If your gut calling is real, you'll make time.

😰 "I'M NOT READY FOR GUT COACHING"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Diana wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting for perfect gut knowledge.

👨 "MY FAMILY DOESN'T GET WHY I'D COACH GUT HEALTH"
Then show them the math. 2 clients = $594. 24 clients/year = $7,128. Show them this is a business decision AND a healing calling.

🤔 "WHAT IF I CAN'T HELP SOMEONE'S GUT?"
What if you DO help them? What if you transform their relationship with food? The only guaranteed failure is ignoring your calling.

Which one is YOUR objection?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with YOUR #1 gut coaching concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special gut coaching scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it later.

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you.

The women making $3K-$6K/month with gut coaching aren't superhuman. They just DECIDED and ACTED when the window was open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Gut Coaching Future Self

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's a gut reset client booking confirmation
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,400 came in this week
• You're sitting in your peaceful home office (finally set up the way you wanted)
• You just finished a session and your client is in tears - she ate bread for the first time in 5 years
• You look at your calendar - only working 15 hours this week
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel ALIVE. You feel like you're helping women HEAL.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our gut health graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Diana was planning her life around bathroom access.
Now she makes $5,100/month and helps women heal their digestion.

6 months ago, Michelle thought she was "too unqualified" to help with gut health.
Now she has 9 clients and a waiting list.

You are 6 months away from a completely different gut coaching life.

The question is: Will you answer the call?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future gut coaching self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today?

6 days left for gut coaching scholarship.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of women become gut health coaches:

THE WAIT TRAP:
"I'll do it next month..."
"After the holidays..."
"When my own gut is perfect..."
"When I have more money saved..."

Your gut will never be perfect. There's never an ideal time. The women who wait usually end up in the same place a year later, still wishing they could help others heal.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences for your gut coaching calling.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up for gut coaching but forgot" → Paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Life got in the way" → Stayed stuck for another year while women suffered

You've invested 39 days in gut health. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Gut Health Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed
✅ Skills for running gut coaching sessions
✅ Systems for getting digestion clients
✅ Knowledge for helping women heal their gut
✅ Community of women supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY gut protocols. Join weekly calls. Build your real gut health practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out gut coaching yourself. Always valid.

OPTION 3: Wait
Let life get busy. Forget about gut coaching. Come back in 6 months when you're "ready." (Most people choose this. Most people stay stuck.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest about gut health coaching.

The women making $3K-$6K/month didn't have special powers. They DECIDED and ACTED.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left for gut coaching certification.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage, I almost didn't take the leap into gut health coaching. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next month"
• "My own gut isn't perfect yet"
• "What if nobody wants my help with digestion?"
• "Who am I to coach gut health?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became confident about gut health.
Not because I had all the answers about digestion.
Not because I felt "ready."

But because I DECIDED that my calling to help women heal was worth more than my fear.

The graduates making $3,000-$6,000/month with gut coaching aren't superhuman. They're not more qualified than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of gut health training. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you do gut coaching.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

Sarah 💚`,

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything about gut health today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART for helping women heal.

Most people don't make it this far with gut coaching. Most people quit by Day 7.

Not you.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Career Accelerator for gut health.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment to digestion. I know your gut story (or at least I can feel it). And I believe you have what it takes to do this for real.

Gut to gut: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your questions about digestion.

And let's build your gut coaching practice together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💚

P.S. - If you have ANY questions about gut health certification, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left for gut coaching scholarship.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really feel into it:

Do you believe in your calling to help women heal their digestion?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to do gut coaching someday."
Not "maybe if my own gut is perfect."

Do you BELIEVE - deep in your gut - that you can help people heal and build a gut health coaching practice?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and your purpose is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days of gut health training. I've seen your commitment.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your gut calling?

48 hours to decide.
