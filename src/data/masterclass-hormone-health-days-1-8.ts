TODAY'S LESSON: Your Struggle Is Your Superpower

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a medical degree. You don't need 10 years of research. You don't need to be post-menopause to help.

Your STRUGGLE - your 3am night sweats, your hot flashes during meetings, your crying in the bathroom for no reason - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about hot flashes in a textbook... or someone who actually LIVED through waking up drenched at 3am wondering if this was her life now?

Exactly.

Your "hormonal mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "midlife crisis" becomes your MISSION.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 hormone struggles you've overcome (or are overcoming). These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE GYM/YOGA FRIEND - The woman who mentioned she can't lose weight no matter what she does

2️⃣ THE CHURCH/BOOK CLUB FRIEND - Someone who's always tired and jokes about "getting old"

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S FRIEND - Your sister's coworker, daughter's friend's mom who's "going through the change"

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been dealing with [hot flashes/sleep issues/brain fog]. I'm building my hormone coaching practice and looking for 3 women to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE woman today with the script above.

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Hormone Knowledge Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I'm more of an expert"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't show up
❌ FREE clients don't make lifestyle changes
❌ FREE clients don't transform
❌ FREE clients make you resent your mission

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the work
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week Hormone Reset: $297-$397
• 3-Month Menopause Transformation: $997-$1,497

Your hormone knowledge is VALUABLE. Charging for it helps MORE women.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Health history, symptoms, current medications/supplements, goals

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a doctor. This is hormone wellness coaching, not medical treatment. Continue working with your healthcare provider."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You facilitate lifestyle changes, NOT diagnose conditions or prescribe treatments

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

The KEY phrase: "I help you optimize your lifestyle to support hormone health. For medical questions, please consult your doctor."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)

TODAY'S LESSON: Tech for Non-Techy Women

Your ENTIRE tech stack to start:

📅 CALENDLY (free) - Clients book themselves
💳 STRIPE/PAYPAL (free) - Get paid online
📝 GOOGLE DOCS (free) - Forms, notes, session prep
📱 ZOOM (free) - Video sessions

THAT'S IT. 4 free tools.

You can run a $3k/month hormone coaching practice with these.

Brain fog making tech hard? I get it. These are SO simple even on a 3am-no-sleep day.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Set up Calendly. Add 2-3 time slots. Takes 10 minutes.

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Hormone Sisters

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for menopause, perimenopause, weight loss over 40
📌 At yoga studios, churches, gyms
📌 Looking for someone who UNDERSTANDS their struggle

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join hormone/menopause groups. Share your story. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every woman you help tells her friends (we ALL talk about our symptoms!)
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at churches, gyms, women's groups about "surviving the change"
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect as someone who gets it.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for women in menopause/perimenopause. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to coach on hormones?"
"What if I don't know enough?"
"I'm not a doctor"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need an MD. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD in understanding what's happening.

🔥 Your EXPERIENCE is your gift. Clients don't want a doctor who's never had a hot flash - they want someone who GETS IT.

🔥 Your struggle is your qualification. You've BEEN up at 3am soaking wet.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things about hormones you know now that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
