        day: 9, gap: "scholarship-urgency", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my nurse coaching practice while still working PRN shifts. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be at the bedside burning out.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 nurse clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Maria...

Maria joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago.

Her situation:
• 52 years old
• ICU nurse for 25 years
• Having panic attacks before every shift
• Compassion fatigue was destroying her
• Broke down crying in the supply closet one night

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started coaching nurses for free
Month 2: First paying client ($197 for burnout coaching)
Month 3: 3 more nurse clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 15 hours/week
Month 10: $5,400/month with 9 regular clients, completely left bedside

Maria didn't have special skills beyond nursing. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I was trapped in nursing forever. Turns out I just needed to USE my nursing differently."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Maria used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💛`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear from nurses:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time between shifts."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful nurse coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Day off #1: 2 client sessions (2 hours)
• Day off #2: 2 client sessions (2 hours)
• Between shifts: Content + discovery call (1 hour)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a hospital. You're building a coaching practice that fits YOUR nursing schedule.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min before your shift starts (you're early anyway)
• 1 hour on your day off (between Target runs)
• Post-night shift before you crash
• While waiting for the kids

Nurses work 3 days a week. You HAVE the other 4 days.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that doesn't destroy me?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "coaching business time." Just block them.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Nurses are chronically underpaid. Student loans. Kids. Life.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year of mandatory overtime
✗ Another year of your back giving out
✗ Another year of missing your kids' events for a shift
✗ Watching other nurses find their way out while you stay stuck

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 coaching sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1 overtime shift you'd hate doing anyway
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 nurse client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your second career with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week burnout recovery program. I was shaking! I'm actually getting PAID to help other nurses!!" - Maria, 52
---

Maria started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if other nurses don't take me seriously?"
• "What if I freeze during a coaching session?"
• "What if they think I'm being preachy?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING NURSE CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my old unit - my former preceptee!" - Donna, 48

"Finally told my nurse manager about my coaching practice. She wants to refer burnt out staff!" - Theresa, 45

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 2 nurses this week." - Carol, 51

These aren't nurses with special business training.

They're nurses who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Nurse Coaching Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: CHECK-IN
"How are you doing since we last talked?"
"What's happening at work right now?"

5-15 min: THE NURSING ASSESSMENT
Use your assessment skills! Ask about:
• Current stress level (1-10)
• Sleep quality
• Physical symptoms (back pain, headaches)
• Emotional state (compassion fatigue screening)

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Burnout recovery strategies
• Boundary setting with work
• Career transition planning
• Work-life balance

Guide them. Don't lecture. Ask powerful questions.

40-50 min: ACTION PLANNING
"What's ONE thing you'll do before our next session?"
Accountability is key.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Gratitude, next session, and encouragement.

THAT'S IT.

You already know how to assess patients. Now you're assessing for wellness, not illness.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The H.E.A.L.T.H. Assessment Method

Want a simple framework to assess ANY nurse client? Use the H.E.A.L.T.H. method.

H - HEAR THEIR STORY
• What's really going on at work?
• When did the burnout start?
• What have they already tried?

E - EXPLORE THE ROOT CAUSE
• Is it the unit culture?
• Staffing issues?
• Personal boundaries?
• Wrong specialty fit?

A - ASSESS THE IMPACT
• Physical symptoms?
• Relationships affected?
• Career goals blocked?
• Mental health concerns?

L - LEVERAGE THEIR STRENGTHS
• What nursing skills do they have?
• What do they actually enjoy about nursing?
• What resources do they have?

T - TRANSFORM WITH ACTION
• What's ONE thing they can change this week?
• What's the bigger goal?

H - HABIT FORMATION
• How do we make this sustainable?
• What accountability do they need?

Score each area 1-10. Start where the pain is deepest.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the H.E.A.L.T.H. assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Nurse Coaching Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Nurse comes once, vents, feels better, old patterns return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No deep transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple touchpoints = real change
• Built-in accountability
• You become their nurse coach, not just a one-time chat
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK BURNOUT RECOVERY:

Week 1: Assessment + Immediate Relief
Week 2: Root Cause + Boundaries
Week 3: Career Clarity + Options
Week 4: Action Plan + Accountability

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something meaningful:
• "The Nurse Burnout Recovery Program"
• "From Burnout to Balanced"
• "Nursing Career Reset"
• "The 4-Week Nurse Wellness Journey"

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

As nurses, we GET scope of practice. But nurse coaching scope is different from clinical scope.

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Provide clinical nursing care or medical advice
• Prescribe medications or treatments
• Diagnose health conditions
• Tell them to change their meds
• Replace therapy or psychiatry
• Act as their bedside nurse

✅ YOU CAN:
• Coach for wellness and life balance
• Help with career transitions
• Support burnout recovery (emotional, not clinical)
• Guide boundary setting and communication
• Facilitate goal setting and accountability
• Share your own nursing experience
• Recommend they see appropriate providers

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If you're experiencing symptoms that feel clinical, I really encourage you to talk to your PCP or a therapist. We can work on the wellness side together."

You know how to refer. That's a nursing skill.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the referral phrase 5 times out loud.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "You're Just a Nurse, Not a Real Coach"

Every nurse coach faces this at some point:
"Why would I pay a nurse for life coaching?"
"Aren't you supposed to be at the bedside?"
"What qualifies YOU to coach?"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE CLINICAL CREDIBILITY
"Actually, my nursing background is exactly WHY I'm effective. I understand healthcare culture from the inside. I know what 12-hour shifts do to your body and mind. I've lived the burnout I help others recover from."

SCRIPT 2: THE EVIDENCE
"Nurse coaching is an established specialty with board certification. The skills I use - assessment, active listening, motivational interviewing - are clinical nursing skills applied to wellness."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"I hear you. A lot of people don't realize nurses can specialize in coaching. Let me share what my clients have experienced..."

NEVER SAY:
"I'm more than just a nurse"
"Nursing wasn't fulfilling enough"
"Anyone can coach"

Position yourself as an ENHANCED nurse, not someone who left nursing.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. Nurses trust other nurses.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Nurse Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE nurse you know who's struggling with burnout or thinking about leaving the bedside? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Nurses KNOW other burnt out nurses. Ask specifically.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them breakthroughs first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Coffee gift card, handwritten thank you note

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a nurse friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been going through a tough time at work. She thought we might be a good fit to talk. Would you be open to a quick call? No pressure - just nurse to nurse."

Warm intro from a trusted colleague → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current client or nurse friend the referral question today.

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private nurse community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified as a nurse coach, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real for you nurses.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from nurses:
• "What if other nurses think I'm abandoning the profession?"
• "What if I fail at something outside of bedside?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone without my stethoscope?"
• "What if my clinical skills are all I have?"
• "What if I'm just running away from hard work?"
• "What if I regret leaving patient care?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if other nurses think I'm abandoning them?"
Worst case: A few colleagues judge me
What I'd do: Find my people who support me
Cost of fear winning: Another year of burnout, back pain, and crying in my car

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
