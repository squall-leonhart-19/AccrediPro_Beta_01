Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my hormone coaching practice while still dealing with my own night sweats. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting (and suffering alone).

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Patricia...

Patricia joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago.

Her situation:
• 53 years old
• Elementary teacher for 25 years
• Having hot flashes during parent conferences
• Waking up at 3am soaked in sweat every night
• Doctor said "just take HRT" but didn't explain anything

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started a free Menopause Circle at church
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 5 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,200/month working 10 hours/week
Month 10: $5,000/month with referral waitlist, transitioning out of teaching

Patricia didn't have special training. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed a nutrition degree. Turns out I just needed the framework and to actually START helping women who were suffering like I was."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Patricia used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💜`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful hormone coaches spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Content + self-care (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a hormone coaching practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning practice (before the hot flashes wake everyone else)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real hormone struggles do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that helps women stop suffering?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "hormone business time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year of hot flashes disrupting your life
✗ Staying in work that doesn't fulfill you
✗ Watching other women struggle alone like you did
✗ Same 3am wake-ups, same frustration next year

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of supplements that don't work
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in helping women with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first discovery call and she SAID YES on the spot. $297 for my 4-week Hormone Reset program. I was having a hot flash during the call and she said 'that's why I trust you!' I'm actually getting PAID to help women with hormones!!" - Patricia, 53
---

Patricia started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if they think I'm not qualified?"
• "What if I can't answer all their hormone questions?"
• "What if they want a doctor instead?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my yoga studio - she saw me fanning myself and asked what I did!" - Sandra, 49

"Finally told my book club about my practice. Two of them want to work with me." - Denise, 55

"Raised my prices to $397 and booked 3 women this week. All struggling with night sweats like I was." - Karen, 51

These aren't special women with medical degrees.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you hormone coaching materials immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Session templates that work for hormone clients
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay helping women who are suffering NOW

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Hormone Health Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: GROUNDING
Open with a calming breath together
"Let's take a moment to check in with our bodies..."

5-15 min: THE SYMPTOM CHECK-IN
"What symptoms have been the most challenging this week?"
"How are you sleeping? Hot flashes? Mood?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how are your energy levels?"

15-40 min: THE COACHING WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Sleep optimization strategies
• Stress and cortisol management
• Nutrition for hormone support
• Movement that helps (not harms) hormones

Guide them through practical changes. Hold supportive space.

40-50 min: ACTION PLANNING
"What's ONE thing you'll try this week?"
Give ONE doable practice for the next 7 days.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Gratitude, next session, and encouragement.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to solve everything. You need to help them take ONE step forward.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The H.O.R.M.O.N.E. Assessment

Want a simple framework to assess ANY hormone client? Use the H.O.R.M.O.N.E. Method.

H - HEAL: Past and current health history
• What symptoms are most disruptive?
• When did they start?
• Family hormone history?

O - OPTIMIZE: Sleep quality and quantity
• How many hours? Wake-ups?
• Night sweats frequency?
• Morning energy level?

R - RESTORE: Stress and adrenal health
• Chronic stress load?
• Cortisol patterns (wired but tired)?
• Recovery capacity?

M - MOVE: Physical activity
• Current exercise type and frequency?
• Energy for movement?
• Movement that might be making things worse?

O - OBSERVE: Cycle patterns (if applicable)
• Regularity? Changes?
• Mood patterns throughout month?
• Heavy/light/spotting changes?

N - NOURISH: Nutrition and hydration
• Blood sugar balance?
• Anti-inflammatory foods?
• Caffeine and alcohol intake?

E - EMPOWER: Mindset and support
• What's worked before?
• Support system?
• What does thriving look like?

Score each area 1-10. The LOWEST score is where you start.

Example: Client scores Sleep 3, Stress 7, Nutrition 5
→ Start with SLEEP. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the H.O.R.M.O.N.E. assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Hormone Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create transformation.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client comes once, feels better, old habits return

Call it something memorable:

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to help with that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose medical conditions
• Prescribe medications or HRT
• Tell someone to stop their medications
• Interpret lab work diagnostically
• Replace their doctor or OB/GYN

✅ YOU CAN:
• Educate about how hormones work
• Suggest lifestyle changes (sleep, stress, nutrition, movement)
• Recommend they ask their doctor about certain tests
• Help them prepare questions for doctor appointments
• Share your own hormone experience
• Guide stress management and self-care
• Encourage them to seek medical care when needed

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"That's a great question for your doctor. What I can help you with is the lifestyle piece - sleep, stress, nutrition."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as a team player with their healthcare.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "Your estrogen is probably low"
Say: "Some of what you're describing sounds like what many women experience when estrogen shifts. Have you talked to your doctor about testing? In the meantime, let's focus on what we CAN control - your sleep and stress."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the "That's a great question for your doctor" phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Is This Real Science?"

Every client (or their spouse) might say some version of this:
"Shouldn't you just see a real doctor?"
"My husband thinks hormone coaching is a scam"
"I'm not sure lifestyle changes can really help hormones"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE RESEARCH
"I hear you. Here's the thing - lifestyle factors like sleep, stress, and nutrition are scientifically proven to affect hormones. I help you implement what research shows works. Your doctor handles the medical side, I handle the daily habits side."

SCRIPT 2: THE TEAM APPROACH
"I actually encourage you to keep seeing your doctor. I work alongside medical care, not instead of it. I focus on the 23 hours a day you're NOT in the doctor's office."

SCRIPT 3: THE VALIDATION
"It makes total sense to be skeptical. What I focus on is really practical - sleep hygiene, stress management, nutrition. Nothing woo-woo, just evidence-based lifestyle support."

NEVER SAY:
"Doctors don't know anything about hormones"
"You don't need medication if you do this"
"Natural is always better"

Position yourself as PRACTICAL and SCIENCE-BASED, not anti-medicine.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

    // Day 20
    {
        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE woman in your life who's struggling with hormone symptoms? Hot flashes, sleep issues, that kind of thing? I'd love to help her like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE WOMAN with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them sleeping better first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (tea, journal, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been dealing with some hormone stuff - the sleep issues, hot flashes, all of it. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open

• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in hormone health coaching, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring hormone coaches:
• "What if I give bad advice about hormones?"
• "What if I fail publicly?"
• "What if my doctor friends judge me?"
• "What if I'm not qualified enough?"
• "What if I can't actually help anyone?"
• "What if this is just my hormones making me impulsive?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if I give bad advice?"
Worst case: I stay in my scope, recommend they see their doctor
What I'd do: Learn from it, adjust my approach
Cost of fear winning: Another year of women suffering alone with their hormones

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of making a mistake and learning.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
