TODAY'S LESSON: Your Late Diagnosis Is Your Greatest Gift

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a psychology degree. You don't need decades of experience. You don't need to have your own ADHD "figured out."

Your EXPERIENCE - your years of struggling, your late diagnosis, your "finally making sense" moment - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who studied ADHD in a textbook... or someone who actually LIVED with undiagnosed ADHD for 40 years and finally found her way?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "scattered years" become your SUPERPOWER.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 ADHD struggles you've overcome. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 ADHD Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE SUPPORT GROUP FRIEND - The woman in your ADHD Facebook group who's struggling with late diagnosis grief

2️⃣ THE MOM FRIEND - The mom who recognized her own ADHD after her kid got diagnosed

3️⃣ THE WORK FRIEND - Your coworker who jokes about being "so ADD" but you see the real struggle underneath

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been dealing with a lot since your diagnosis. I'm building my ADHD coaching practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your ADHD Expertise Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I'm more 'qualified'"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't show up (and we KNOW about ADHD and follow-through!)
❌ FREE clients don't implement the strategies
❌ FREE clients don't transform
❌ FREE clients make you resent your coaching

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the work
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION - and our ADHD clients NEED that accountability!

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week ADHD Jumpstart: $297-$397
• 3-Month Brain Transformation: $997-$1,497

ADHD coaching is VALUABLE. Charging for it is professional.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

    },

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Background, diagnosis history, current ADHD struggles, goals

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a therapist or medical provider. This is ADHD coaching support, not mental health treatment or medical advice."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You help with ADHD life strategies, NOT diagnose ADHD or prescribe medication

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

Important distinction: Coaches help with LIFE STRATEGIES. Therapists treat mental health conditions. Doctors prescribe medication. YOU help clients work WITH their ADHD brain.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

        day: 5, gap: "tech", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Tech for ADHD Brains (Keep It Simple!)

Your ENTIRE tech stack to start (ADHD-friendly = minimal!):

📅 CALENDLY (free) - Clients book themselves (no back-and-forth scheduling emails!)
💳 STRIPE/PAYPAL (free) - Get paid online
📝 GOOGLE DOCS (free) - Forms, notes, session prep
📱 ZOOM (free) - Video sessions

THAT'S IT. 4 free tools.

I know our ADHD brains want to research 47 different options, but STOP. Use these four. Done.

You can run a $3k/month ADHD coaching practice with these.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Set up Calendly. Add 2-3 time slots. Takes 10 minutes. Set a timer!

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your ADHD Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE IN SPECIFIC PLACES.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for ADHD women, late diagnosis support, neurodivergent adults
📌 In Reddit communities like r/adhdwomen and r/TwoXADHD
📌 At ADHD support meetups, CHADD chapters, neurodiversity events
📌 Looking for someone who GETS them (not another neurotypical professional)

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join ADHD groups. Share your story. Add value. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every woman you help tells 3 others who struggle
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at libraries, churches, women's groups about adult ADHD
4️⃣ ADHD PROVIDER REFERRALS - Connect with therapists and psychiatrists who need coaching referrals

No algorithms. No hashtags. Just showing up where WE already are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for ADHD women. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to coach ADHD when I can barely manage my own?"
"What if my ADHD makes me unreliable as a coach?"
"I'm not a therapist - I can't really help people"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to have ADHD "figured out." You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

🔥 Your ADHD brain IS your gift. Clients don't want a neurotypical professional - they want someone who ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS the struggle.

🔥 Your late diagnosis is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago (undiagnosed, struggling, feeling broken) have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now about ADHD that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
