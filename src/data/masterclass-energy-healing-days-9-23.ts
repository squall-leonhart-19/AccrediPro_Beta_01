Yesterday I mentioned the Career Accelerator scholarship...

Wanted to share a quick update: 1 of the 3 spots is already claimed.

I get it if timing isn't right. Truly.

But if you're waiting for the "perfect moment" - it doesn't exist.

I started my energy healing practice while still exhausted from my day job. If I waited for "ready," I'd still be waiting.

Here's what Scholarship includes again:
• Full ASI Certification
• Done-For-You materials (website, forms, session guides)
• Weekly group calls with me
• Private community access
• Client attraction templates

$297 (normally $997)

If 2 clients pay you $150 each = investment covered + profit.

Reply if you have questions. I answer personally.

More success stories coming tomorrow...

    // Day 10
    {
        day: 10, gap: "case-study", sarah: `{firstName}, let me tell you about Luna...

Luna joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago.

Her situation:
• 46 years old
• Elementary school teacher for 18 years
• Having panic attacks in the school bathroom
• Chronic fatigue that no doctor could explain
• Felt like she was absorbing everyone's energy

What happened:

Month 1: Got her certification, started free sessions for 3 teacher friends
Month 2: First paying client ($197 package)
Month 3: 4 more clients through word of mouth
Month 4: Raised prices to $350, still booking
Month 6: $3,800/month working 14 hours/week
Month 8: $4,800/month with 10 regulars, quit teaching

Luna didn't have special psychic gifts. She followed the system.

She:
✅ Used the done-for-you templates
✅ Showed up to weekly calls
✅ Asked questions when stuck
✅ Didn't overthink - just took action

Her quote: "I thought I needed to be some kind of mystic. Turns out I just needed the right framework and to actually START."

Tomorrow I'll share the exact framework Luna used to get her first 3 clients.

Rooting for you,
Sarah 💜`,

TODAY'S LESSON: The "I Don't Have Time" Truth

This is the #1 objection I hear:
"I'd love to do this, but I don't have time."

Here's my honest response:

You don't have time because you don't have a SYSTEM.

Here's how successful energy healers spend their time:

THE 5-HOUR WEEK MODEL:
• Monday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Tuesday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Wednesday: Self-care + content (1.5 hours)
• Thursday: 1 client session (1 hour)
• Friday: Discovery call (30 min)

Total: 5 hours
Potential income: $600-$1,200/week

That's it.

You're not building a corporate job. You're building a sacred practice that fits YOUR life.

WHERE THE TIME COMES FROM:
• 30 min morning energy practice (before anyone needs you)
• 30 min during lunch break
• 1 hour while kids/grandkids are at activities
• Weekend morning batch for content

Real women with real lives do this EVERY DAY.

The question isn't "Do I have time?"
It's "Will I MAKE time for work that matters?"

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block 5 hours in your calendar this week for "sacred practice time." Just block them. You can do it.

Let's address the elephant in the room...

"I can't afford it right now."

I hear you. Money feels tight. The economy is weird. You have bills.

But let me reframe this:

THE COST OF NOT STARTING:

✗ Another year feeling energetically depleted
✗ Staying in work that drains your life force
✗ Watching other women step into their calling
✗ Same exhaustion next year, same frustrations

THE COST OF STARTING:

$297 (scholarship rate)
= 2 client sessions at entry-level pricing
= 1-2 weeks of coffee shop spending
= Less than $25/month

THE ROI MATH:

• 1 client pays $197 = 66% of investment back
• 2 clients = investment covered + profit
• 5 clients = you've 3x'd your investment

This isn't an expense. It's an INVESTMENT in your calling with a clear return path.

If you truly can't afford $297, I understand, and this program will always be here.

But if you CAN afford it and the price is an excuse for fear... let's talk about that fear instead.

Reply to this message if you're on the fence. I'll help you work through it.

Honestly,

Just got this message and had to share:

---
"Sarah, I can't believe it. I just had my first client and she felt the shift immediately. She's already booking her next session! I'm actually getting PAID to do energy work!!" - Luna, 46
---

Luna started exactly where you are now.

She had doubts:
• "What if people think I'm weird?"
• "What if I can't feel their energy?"
• "What if nothing happens in the session?"

She did it anyway.

And now she has a PAYING CLIENT.

More messages from this week:

"Got my second client through my yoga studio connection!" - Maya, 48

"Finally told my family about my practice. My sister wants a session!" - Amber, 52

"Raised my prices to $350 and booked 2 people this week." - Crystal, 44

These aren't psychic women with special powers.

They're women who DECIDED and then DID.

Tomorrow: Last day of scholarship pricing.

Scholarship pricing ends TONIGHT at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997.

I won't email you 47 times begging. This is my last message about it.

Here's what you're deciding between:

OPTION A - JOIN NOW ($297):
• Get certified in 30 days
• Use done-for-you materials immediately
• Weekly calls to ask questions
• Community of 200+ women supporting you
• Session templates that work
• 12 months of support

OPTION B - WAIT:
• Pay $997 next time (if spots available)
• Figure it out alone
• Make mistakes others have already solved
• Delay your energy healing calling by months

Both are valid choices.

Only you know what's right for you.

If you're ready: [Link to Application]

If not now, you can always reach out later when timing is better.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

With respect for your decision,
Sarah 💜

P.S. - If you apply tonight and need a payment plan, just mention it in your application. We'll work something out.`,

Week 2 starts now - let's build real SKILLS.

TODAY'S LESSON: Running Your First Energy Healing Session

Feeling nervous about your first real session? Here's exactly what to do:

THE 60-MINUTE SESSION STRUCTURE:

0-5 min: GROUNDING
Open with a brief centering breath together
"Let's take a moment to connect with our energy..."

5-15 min: THE ASSESSMENT
"Where do you feel heaviness or blocks in your body?"
"When did the depletion start?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how's your energy today?"

15-40 min: THE ENERGY WORK
Pick ONE focus area for today. Not 5 things. ONE.
• Clearing a specific chakra
• Releasing stored emotion
• Grounding scattered energy
• Restoring boundaries

Guide them through the technique. Hold sacred space.

40-50 min: INTEGRATION
"What did you notice during the session?"
Give ONE practice for the week ahead.

50-60 min: CLOSE
Gratitude, next session, and a grounding close.

THAT'S IT.

You don't need to clear everything. You need to hold space for ONE shift.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice your session structure out loud. Time yourself.

TODAY'S LESSON: The 5 Root Causes of Energy Blockages

Want a simple framework to assess ANY client? Use the 5 Root Causes.

ROOT CAUSE 1: STORED TRAUMA
• Past experiences stuck in the energy body?
• Body holding shock or fear?
• Triggers that overwhelm the system?

ROOT CAUSE 2: EMOTIONAL SUPPRESSION
• Feelings not allowed to move?
• Unexpressed grief, anger, or fear?
• "Keeping it together" for too long?

ROOT CAUSE 3: ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICITY
• Draining work environment?
• Toxic relationships at home?
• Physical spaces that feel heavy?

ROOT CAUSE 4: RELATIONAL DRAIN
• Energy vampires in their life?
• Boundaries being violated?
• Giving more than receiving?

ROOT CAUSE 5: SPIRITUAL DISCONNECTION
• Lost sense of purpose?
• Disconnected from intuition?
• "Going through the motions" feeling?

Score each root cause 1-10. The DEEPEST block is where you start.

Example: Client scores Trauma 4, Suppression 8, Toxicity 6, Drain 5, Disconnection 7
→ Start with EMOTIONAL SUPPRESSION. That's your focus.

Simple. Clear. Clients understand it immediately.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 5 Root Causes assessment on YOURSELF. Score each area 1-10.

TODAY'S LESSON: Creating Your Signature Energy Healing Program

Stop selling single sessions. They don't create lasting shifts.

Why packages WIN:

❌ SINGLE SESSIONS:
• Client feels better temporarily, old patterns return
• You're constantly chasing new clients
• No lasting transformation = no testimonials
• Income is unpredictable

✅ PACKAGES:
• Multiple sessions = real energetic rewiring
• Built-in accountability
• You become their energy guide
• Testimonials + referrals flow naturally
• Predictable sacred income

THE SIMPLE 4-WEEK ENERGY RESET:

Week 1: Assessment + First Clearing
Week 2: Deep Release + Core Block
Week 3: Restoration + Rebuilding
Week 4: Integration + Maintenance Plan

Price: $297-$497 (depends on your market)

Call it something meaningful:
• "The Energy Reset Journey"
• "4 Weeks to Energetic Clarity"
• "The Vitality Restoration Program"
• "Full Spectrum Energy Clearing"

Naming it makes it REAL and VALUABLE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Name your signature program. Write down what the 4 weeks cover.

TODAY'S LESSON: What You CAN and CAN'T Do (Scope of Practice)

This keeps women stuck: "Am I allowed to do that?"

Let's clear it up forever.

❌ YOU CANNOT:
• Diagnose medical or mental health conditions
• Prescribe medications or supplements
• Tell someone to stop their medical treatment
• Claim to "cure" anything
• Replace licensed medical or mental health care

✅ YOU CAN:
• Facilitate energy balancing practices
• Guide meditation and breathwork
• Help with chakra clearing and energy techniques
• Explore emotional releases through energy work
• Hold sacred space for processing
• Recommend they see a doctor if needed
• Share your own energy experiences

THE MAGIC PHRASE:
"If this feels like it needs medical attention, I encourage you to also speak with a healthcare provider."

Use it liberally. It protects you AND positions you as collaborative.

EXAMPLE LANGUAGE:
Instead of: "Your thyroid chakra is blocked"
Say: "I'm sensing some heaviness in the throat area energetically. Have you had any physical symptoms checked by a doctor? Energy work and medical care work beautifully together."

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice the collaborative phrase 5 times.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling "Energy Work Sounds Fake"

Every client (or their family) might say some version of this:
"Isn't this just placebo?"
"My husband thinks this is BS"
"I'm not sure if I believe in energy"

How to handle it (without getting defensive):

SCRIPT 1: THE SCIENCE
"I hear you. A lot of people feel that way at first. There's actually research on biofield therapies and how stress affects the body's electromagnetic field. What I do is grounded in that science - it's about helping your nervous system reset."

SCRIPT 2: THE EXPERIENCE
"Your skepticism is healthy. The best way to know if it works is to experience it. Most of my clients come in skeptical and leave feeling different. Let your body decide."

SCRIPT 3: THE PRACTICAL
"I focus on practical results - better sleep, less tension, more energy. You don't have to believe in anything mystical. Just notice how you feel before and after."

NEVER SAY:
"You just don't understand energy"
"You need to be more open"
"It works if you believe"

Position yourself as PRACTICAL and GROUNDED, not mystical.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice Script 1 out loud until it feels natural.

        day: 20, gap: "referrals", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: The Referral System That Fills Your Practice

The easiest clients are REFERRALS. They already trust you.

Here's how to get more:

THE SIMPLE ASK (Non-Awkward Version):
At the end of every session, say:

"I'm so glad we're working together. Quick question - who's ONE person in your life who feels drained or overwhelmed? I'd love to help them like I'm helping you."

That's it.

Don't ask for "referrals." Ask for ONE PERSON with a SPECIFIC struggle.

THE TRIPLE R SYSTEM:
1. RESULTS - Get them shifts first (they'll naturally want to share)
2. REMIND - Mention at end of sessions that you have availability
3. REWARD - Small thank you for referrals (crystals, essential oil, handwritten note)

THE REFERRAL FOLLOW-UP:
When someone refers a friend:
"Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you've been feeling depleted. She thought we might be a good fit. Would you be open to a quick call to see if I can help? No pressure."

Warm intro → Easy conversation.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask ONE current friend/client the referral question today.

✅ How to price without guilt
✅ Legal basics that protect you
✅ Simple tech setup
✅ Marketing that works for energy healers

Remember the Career Accelerator I mentioned during Week 2?

For those who joined - welcome! You're already in the private community.

For those who weren't ready - I hear you. Timing matters.

But I want you to know: the next round is coming.

AND... I'm opening a WAITLIST.

Why join the waitlist?
• First access when doors open
• Exclusive scholarship consideration
• Bonus Q&A call for waitlist members
• No commitment - just first dibs

If you're even THINKING about getting certified in energy healing, get on the waitlist now. There's zero obligation, but you won't miss the window.

Tomorrow: We start Phase 3 - "Everything You Need Except The Credential"

This is where it gets real.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Fear Audit

Let's get honest about what's REALLY stopping you.

Grab a pen. Write down your fears. All of them.

Common ones I hear from aspiring energy healers:
• "What if people think I'm crazy?"
• "What if I can't actually feel energy?"
• "What if my family judges me?"
• "What if I'm not gifted enough?"
• "What if nothing happens in sessions?"
• "What if I'm being delusional about my abilities?"

Now here's the exercise:

FOR EACH FEAR, ASK:

1. "What's the WORST that could actually happen?"
2. "What would I do if that happened?"
3. "What's the cost of letting this fear win?"

EXAMPLE:
Fear: "What if people think I'm crazy?"
Worst case: A few people judge me
What I'd do: Find my people who GET it
Cost of fear winning: Another year depleted, staying in work that drains me, ignoring my calling

Usually the cost of INACTION is way worse than the cost of being judged.

The fear is real. The danger usually isn't.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 fears. Do the exercise above.
