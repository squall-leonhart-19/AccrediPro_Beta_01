TODAY'S LESSON: Advanced Hormone Assessment Skills

Let's level up your client work.

BEYOND THE BASICS - What to look for:

🔍 SYMPTOM CLUSTERS that reveal hormonal patterns:
• Anxiety + insomnia + PMS → Low progesterone
• Fatigue + weight gain + cold hands → Thyroid connection
• Brain fog + belly fat + irritability → Cortisol dominance
• Low libido + no motivation + muscle loss → Testosterone decline
• Heavy periods + breast tenderness + mood swings → Estrogen dominance

ADVANCED QUESTIONS:
"When in your cycle do symptoms peak?"
"What time of day is worst?"
"What makes it better or worse?"
"How has this changed over the last 2 years?"

PATTERN RECOGNITION = PROFESSIONAL CREDIBILITY.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice identifying 3 symptom clusters from your tracking data.

        day: 26, gap: "testimonials", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials That SELL

TESTIMONIALS = TRUST = CLIENTS.

THE 3-QUESTION TESTIMONIAL:
Ask your client:
1. "What was life like BEFORE we worked together?"
2. "What's different NOW?"
3. "What would you say to someone thinking about hormone health coaching?"

THAT'S IT. 3 questions. 60-second video or written.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook post (with permission)
• Intake form confirmation page
• Website (when you build one)
• Group program sales page
• Coffee chat conversations ("one of my clients said...")

START COLLECTING FROM DAY 1.

Even from practice clients. Even from friends you've helped.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Ask 1 person you've helped for a testimonial. Use the 3 questions.

        day: 27, gap: "retention", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Client Retention — Making Them Stay (And Refer)

Getting clients is HARD.
KEEPING them is where the money is.

THE RETENTION FRAMEWORK:
1️⃣ WEEKLY CHECK-INS - 5-minute text/voice message. "How was your week? Any changes?"
2️⃣ CELEBRATE WINS - Even tiny ones. "You slept 6 hours?! That's AMAZING for where you started!"
3️⃣ ANTICIPATE SETBACKS - "Week 3 of a protocol is often hard. Here's why..."
4️⃣ EVOLVE THE PLAN - Monthly protocol updates keep it fresh
5️⃣ REFERRAL PROGRAM - "$50 off your next package for every friend who joins"

CLIENT LIFETIME VALUE:
• 1 client × $297/month × 6 months = $1,782
• That same client refers 2 friends = $3,564 total

RETENTION > ACQUISITION. Always.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Send a check-in message to everyone you've worked with. Even practice clients.

TODAY'S LESSON: Menopause & Beyond — The Overlooked Opportunity

Most hormone coaches focus on perimenopause.

POSTMENOPAUSE IS A GOLDMINE:

Women 55-70 still need support with:
• Bone density (osteoporosis prevention)
• Heart health (estrogen was protecting them)
• Cognitive health (brain fog doesn't always stop)
• Weight management (metabolism has permanently shifted)
• Libido and vaginal health (talk about it — nobody else will)
• Joint pain and inflammation

THE OPPORTUNITY:
These women have MORE disposable income, MORE time, and are DESPERATE for guidance.

Most coaches ignore them. DON'T.

YOUR POST-MENOPAUSE PACKAGE:
"Thriving After Menopause" — 3-month program focusing on bone, heart, brain, and vitality.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Think about 3 postmenopausal women you know. What would they pay for ongoing support?

TODAY'S LESSON: Scaling to $5K/Month

Let me break down the MATH:

PATH 1: ALL 1:1
• 5 clients × $297/month × 4 sessions = $1,485/month
• 10 clients × $297/month = $2,970/month
• Need 17 clients for $5k (that's a LOT of hours)

PATH 2: HYBRID (recommended!)
• 5 × 1:1 clients @ $347/month = $1,735/month
• 1 × Group program (12 women @ $247) = $2,964/month
• 1 × Workshop revenue = $500/month
• TOTAL: $5,199/month — working 20 hours/week

PATH 3: GROUP-HEAVY
• 2 × Group cohorts (20 women @ $247) = $4,940/month
• 3 × 1:1 premium clients @ $497/month = $1,491/month
• TOTAL: $6,431/month — working 15 hours/week

TODAY'S LESSON: Strategic Networking for Hormone Coaches

THE REFERRAL NETWORK:

🏥 FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE DOCTORS - They value lifestyle coaching. Partner, don't compete.
🧘 YOGA/PILATES STUDIOS - Their members are your ideal clients. Offer free workshops.
💆 MASSAGE THERAPISTS & ACUPUNCTURISTS - Cross-refer. They see hormone-struggling women daily.
🏋️ PERSONAL TRAINERS - They need hormone-knowledgeable partners for 40+ clients.
💊 SUPPLEMENT STORES - Leave business cards. Educate staff.

THE APPROACH:
"Hi, I'm [name], a certified hormone health specialist. I work with women going through perimenopause and menopause. I'd love to explore how we can support each other's clients."

NOT SALES. PARTNERSHIP.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reach out to ONE local practitioner this week with the partnership approach.

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Boundaries in Your Practice

THIS WILL SAVE YOUR SANITY.

BOUNDARIES YOU NEED:

⏰ TIME BOUNDARIES:
• No client calls before 9am or after 5pm
• No weekend sessions (unless you choose to)
• 15-minute buffer between sessions

📱 COMMUNICATION BOUNDARIES:
• Text support during business hours only
• 24-hour response time for non-urgent messages
• Emergency = go to their doctor, not you

💰 PAYMENT BOUNDARIES:
• Payment BEFORE sessions, not after
• Clear cancellation policy (24-hour notice)
• No "can I pay next week" — payment plans exist for a reason

❤️ EMOTIONAL BOUNDARIES:
• You are not their therapist
• Refer out for mental health concerns
• Take care of YOUR hormones too

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write your top 5 non-negotiable boundaries. Post them where you see them daily.

TODAY'S LESSON: Simple Content That Attracts Clients

YOU NEED 4 TYPES OF CONTENT:

1️⃣ EDUCATION POSTS (2x/week)
"Did you know progesterone is the first hormone to decline in perimenopause?"

2️⃣ STORY POSTS (1x/week)
"Last year I couldn't remember my students' names..."

3️⃣ CLIENT WINS (1x/week - with permission)
"My client finally slept through the night after 3 years..."

4️⃣ CALL TO ACTION (1x/week)
"I have 2 spots open for my Hormone Reset. DM me."

THAT'S 5 POSTS PER WEEK.
Batch them on Sunday. Schedule them. Done.

CONTENT FORMULA:
Hook → Story → Lesson → Question

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 5 posts for this week. Use the templates.

Say it with me:

"I am a Certified Women's Hormone Health Specialist."

Not "I'm trying to be..."
Not "I'm kind of doing..."
Not "I'm interested in..."

YOU ARE.

YOUR PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY:
✅ Business cards with your title and credential
✅ Email signature: "Catherine Smith | Certified Women's Hormone Health Specialist"
✅ Social media bios updated
✅ Elevator pitch: "I help women over 40 reclaim their energy, sleep, and sanity through personalized hormone health coaching."

LANGUAGE MATTERS.
"I'm a coach" → "I'm a specialist"
"I help people" → "I specialize in women's hormone health"
"I'm learning" → "I practice evidence-based hormone health coaching"

TODAY'S LESSON: Your Path to $3K/Month in 90 Days

THIS IS THE REAL NUMBER.

Most women ask "can I really make money doing this?"

Let me show you EXACTLY how:

MONTH 1 (Days 1-30):
• 2-3 practice clients → 1-2 paying clients
• Income: $194-$594

MONTH 2 (Days 31-60):
• 3-5 paying clients + 1 group program start
• Income: $891-$1,735

MONTH 3 (Days 61-90):
• 5-8 paying clients + active group
• Income: $2,200-$3,500

IT'S A RAMP. Not overnight.

THE WOMEN WHO HIT $3K:
✅ Did every daily action
✅ Started before feeling ready
✅ Asked for help in the community
✅ Didn't compare their week 1 to someone's month 6

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write your 30-60-90 day plan. Specific actions, not wishes.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your Future Self Is Counting On You

Close your eyes. Imagine 12 months from now:

🌅 You wake up WITHOUT an alarm
☕ Morning coffee without rushing to a job you resent
📱 Your Calendly pings with a new booking
💰 You check your account: $4,800 deposited this month
😭 A client texts: "You literally saved my quality of life"
👩‍👧 You pick up your grandkids from school at 2pm
🌙 You sleep through the night (your hormones are balanced too)

That's not fantasy. That's MATH + ACTION + TIME.

Every woman in this group who followed the steps is living some version of this RIGHT NOW.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self 12 months from now. What does she thank you for?

TOMORROW IS YOUR LAST DAY!

But first...

You are now part of something bigger than a course.

You're part of a MOVEMENT of women who refuse to let other women suffer through hormone hell alone.

Every perimenopause woman you help...
Every menopausal woman who finally sleeps...
Every woman who stops being gaslit by her doctor...

That's YOUR legacy.

You didn't just learn about hormones.
You became the ADVOCATE that you wished you had.

TOMORROW: Your graduation message + what's next.

Thank you for showing up. Every. Single. Day.

Sarah 🔥`,
