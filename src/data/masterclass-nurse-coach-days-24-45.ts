TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Continuing Education Credits

You know a LOT now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find nurse clients
• How to price
• How to run coaching sessions
• How to get referrals
• What to say, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Transformation

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "after my next shift." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE nurse about your practice
• Set up Calendly
• Post ONE thing on LinkedIn about burnout
• Complete your intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence.

Stop earning CEUs. Start DOING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 weeks. After they have ANY breakthrough.
• "I finally set a boundary with my charge nurse!"
• "I didn't pick up overtime for the first time in months!"
• "I actually slept through the night!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's amazing! Would you mind writing a quick testimonial about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], I felt [burnt out/stuck/exhausted]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• LinkedIn posts
• Discovery call prep ("Read what other nurses say...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE (even for free), ask for a testimonial today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help (burnt out nurses, career changers)
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help nurses recover from burnout and build careers that don't destroy their bodies"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"After 20 years at the bedside, I found a way to use my nursing skills without the 12-hour shifts..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Nurse Burnout Recovery - $297

4. TESTIMONIALS: 2-3 quotes from nurses
Even if informal. Even if from free clients.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

    {
        day: 27, gap: "boundaries", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Boundaries With Clients (You Know How To Do This)

As a nurse, you already know about professional boundaries. But coaching boundaries are different.

You'll encounter:
• "Can I text you when I have a bad shift?"
• "Can we meet on your day off? That's when I'm free"
• "I know our session is over but just one more thing..."
• "Can you just tell me what to do? You're the nurse"

Setting boundaries isn't mean. It's SUSTAINABLE coaching.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to messages within 24-48 hours. For mental health emergencies, please contact a crisis line."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold coaching sessions on my days off from [day/day], 10am-4pm. I protect my rest days too."

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on wellness and career coaching - not clinical advice. For medical concerns, please see your provider."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I check messages once per day to model the balance I teach. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

You set boundaries with patients. Now set them with clients.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for Working Nurses

You're probably still working shifts. Or you have family. Or both. Plus aging parents.

Time is limited. Here's how to make it work:

THE BATCH METHOD:

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting), batch similar tasks:

• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon on your day off, create a week's worth of posts
• SESSION DAY: Stack all your coaching sessions on 2 days
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, scheduling, invoicing all at once

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your coaching business:
• 6:00-7:00am before your shift (you're up anyway)
• 1:00-2:00pm on day off #1
• 3:00-4:00pm on day off #2

These are YOURS. No guilt.

THE 80/20 RULE:

20% of your activities create 80% of results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, coaching sessions, referral asks
Low ROI: Scrolling nursing memes, "researching," reorganizing your Canva

Do MORE of the 20%. Ignore the rest.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating this as a SIDE HUSTLE or a CAREER TRANSITION?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

SIDE HUSTLE:
• Help a few nurse friends for extra income
• No pressure to leave bedside
• Coach when you feel like it
• Maybe make some money on the side

CAREER TRANSITION:
• Building an actual coaching practice
• Working toward replacing bedside income
• Getting serious about nurse coaching
• Doing this for REAL

Both are valid.

But only one leads to leaving those 12-hour shifts behind.

If you're choosing CAREER TRANSITION...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself. Which are you choosing?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating this as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find nurse clients (coworkers, nursing networks, referrals)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 programs)
✅ You know how to run sessions (H.E.A.L.T.H. framework)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, scope)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to market (nursing groups, word of mouth)
✅ You know how to handle imposter syndrome
✅ You know your scope of practice
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonials

You have EVERYTHING you need...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for nurse coaching:

🔐 LIABILITY: Official certification documents your competence outside clinical care

💼 PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING: "Certified Nurse Coach" vs "nurse who does coaching on the side"

🩺 NURSING CREDIBILITY: Certification adds to your nursing credentials, shows professional development

👥 NURSE TRUST: Nurses trust credentialed colleagues - we're credential people

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified nurse coaches charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have skills.
With the credential, you have a PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Math That Changes Everything

Let's do the math together...

CAREER ACCELERATOR INVESTMENT: $297

YOUR FIRST CLIENT:
• 4-Week Burnout Recovery Program = $297
• ONE nurse client = Investment recovered ✅

YOUR THIRD CLIENT:
• 3 x $297 = $891
• Profit after investment: $594

YOUR FIRST YEAR (Conservative):
• 2 nurse clients/month x 12 months = 24 clients
• 24 x $297 = $7,128
• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our nurse graduates are actually doing.

Maria started 10 months ago. She now makes $5,400/month.
Donna started 8 months ago. She makes $3,200/month.
Theresa started 6 months ago. She just hit $1,800/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are - burnt out nurses looking for another way.

The difference? They saw the math and made the decision.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 nurse clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Maria - From ICU Burnout to $5,400/Month Helping Nurses

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Maria joined the Career Accelerator 10 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 52 years old, ICU nurse for 25 years
• Having panic attacks before every shift
• Broke down crying in the supply closet
• Compassion fatigue was destroying her marriage

THE TURNING POINT:
• Had a breakdown after losing 3 patients in one shift
• Knew she couldn't do bedside anymore
• "I had no idea what else a nurse could even DO"

NOW (10 months later):
• $5,400/month income (18 hours/week)
• 9 regular nurse clients
• Referrals coming from Employee Assistance Programs
• Completely left bedside 8 months ago
• "I've never felt more like a NURSE than I do now"

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 25 years thinking bedside was all I could do. Turns out I just needed to use my nursing skills DIFFERENTLY. Don't wait until you break. Get out before you have to."

Maria is real. Her results are real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Watch Maria's full story in the Resources section.

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started...

You can have all the nursing skills in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone.

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - pricing, clients, leaving bedside
• Real-time feedback and guidance
• Never feel stuck alone

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Session templates
• Intake forms
• Email scripts
• Social media posts
• All customized for NURSE coaching

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified nurse coaches
• Share wins and challenges
• Accountability partners
• Referral network of nurses

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me
• Personalized guidance
• Help when you're stuck

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT.

I tried to do this alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got a mentor, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

Reply with your #1 question or struggle right now. I'll help you.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping You

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR FROM NURSES:

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
I get it. Nurses are underpaid. Here's the truth: $297 is ONE client. If you can't find ONE burnt out nurse with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my graduates. They work 3 12s, have kids, have aging parents. They found 5-10 hours/week on their days off. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY.

😰 "I'M NOT READY"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Maria wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting.

🏥 "WHAT IF I MISS PATIENT CARE?"
You'll still be a nurse. You'll still help people. You'll just help them BEFORE they end up as patients. Preventive vs reactive.

🤔 "WHAT IF I FAIL?"
What if you succeed? What if this is your way out? The only guaranteed failure is staying until you burn out completely.

Which one is YOUR objection?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply with YOUR #1 concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it later.

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you.

The nurses who succeed aren't superhuman. They just DECIDE and ACT when the window is open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Future Self

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's a nurse booking a discovery call
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,600 came in this week
• You're sitting in your home office (no scrubs, no badge)
• You just finished a session and your client is in tears - relief tears, not burnout tears
• You look at your calendar - working 18 hours this week (not 48)
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel HEALTHY. You feel FREE.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our nurse graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Maria was crying in the supply closet.
Now she makes $5,400/month and helps nurses find their way out.

6 months ago, Donna thought she was "too old" to leave bedside.
Now she has 7 clients and works from home.

You are 6 months away from a completely different nursing career.

The question is: Will you take the exit?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today?

6 days left.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of nurses:

THE WAIT TRAP:
"I'll do it next month..."
"After this stretch of shifts..."
"When work calms down..."
"When I have more saved..."

Work never calms down. There's never a perfect time. The nurses who wait usually end up calling out sick with back pain a year later, wishing they'd started.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences for your body and soul.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up but forgot" → Paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Just one more year at bedside" → Ended up on disability

You've invested 39 days. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed
✅ Skills for running nurse coaching sessions
✅ Systems for getting nurse clients
✅ Knowledge for helping nurses heal from burnout
✅ Community of nurses supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY materials. Join weekly calls. Build your real practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out the rest yourself. Always valid.

OPTION 3: Wait
Let another year of 12-hour shifts pass. Come back when you're "ready." (Most nurses choose this. Most nurses stay stuck.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest.

The nurses making $3K-$6K/month didn't have special powers. They DECIDED and ACTED.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage, I almost didn't take the leap. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next schedule change"
• "I need to save more first"
• "What if nobody wants my help?"
• "Who am I to coach other nurses?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became confident.
Not because I had all the answers.
Not because I felt "ready."

But because I DECIDED that my health was worth more than my fear.

The nurses making $3,000-$6,000/month aren't superhuman. They're not more skilled than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of training. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you do this.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

Sarah 💛`,

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART.

Most people don't make it this far. Most people quit by Day 7.

Not you, nurse.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Career Accelerator.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment. I know your story (or at least I can feel it). And I believe you have what it takes to leave bedside and do this for real.

Nurse to nurse: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your questions.

And let's build this together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you have ANY questions, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really feel into it:

Do you believe you can leave bedside and still be a nurse?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to coach someday."
Not "maybe if everything goes perfectly."

Do you BELIEVE - deep down - that you can use your nursing skills differently and build a coaching practice?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and your new career is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days. I've seen your commitment.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your ability to help nurses?

48 hours to decide.
