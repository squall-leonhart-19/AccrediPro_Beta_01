TODAY'S LESSON: Your Health Journey Is Your Greatest Gift

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a nutrition degree from a fancy university. You don't need 10 years of clinical experience. You don't need to be a doctor.

Your JOURNEY - your struggle with inflammation, your confusion with food, your breakthrough moment - THAT is what makes clients trust you.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about anti-inflammatory eating in a textbook... or someone who actually LIVED through the inflammation, the medications, the trial and error, and found their way to healing?

Exactly.

Your "mess" becomes your MESSAGE.
Your "breakdown" becomes your BREAKTHROUGH.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 health struggles you've overcome or are overcoming. These become your "I understand you" stories.

📎 Download: "Origin Story Worksheet" in your portal Resources

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE GYM/YOGA FRIEND - The woman who mentioned she's always bloated and tired

2️⃣ THE CHURCH/BOOK CLUB FRIEND - Someone who's seen your own food transformation

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S FRIEND - Your sister's coworker, daughter's friend dealing with inflammation or weight issues

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been struggling with [bloating/energy/inflammation]. I'm building my nutrition coaching practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute conversation?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

        day: 3, gap: "pricing", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Nutrition Expertise Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free until I'm more qualified"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't show up
❌ FREE clients don't follow the meal plan
❌ FREE clients don't transform
❌ FREE clients make you resent your calling

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients do the food prep
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Nutrition Session: $97-$150
• 4-Week Reset Program: $297-$397
• 12-Week Transformation: $997-$1,497

Helping someone heal with food is VALUABLE. Charging for it is ethical.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Health history, current diet, medications, goals

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a doctor or dietitian. This is nutrition education and coaching, not medical nutrition therapy."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You educate and coach on nutrition, NOT diagnose, treat, or prescribe

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

📎 Downloads in Resources:
• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Ideal Nutrition Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for autoimmune support, clean eating, inflammation
📌 At yoga studios, gyms, health food stores
📌 Looking for someone they TRUST with their health

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join health groups. Share anti-inflammatory recipes. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every person you help tells 3 others
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at churches, libraries, women's health groups
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect and share food wisdom.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for health-conscious women. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to give nutrition advice?"
"What if I'm not qualified enough?"
"I'm not a registered dietitian"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need a nutrition degree. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

🔥 Your EXPERIENCE is your gift. Clients don't want a textbook expert - they want someone who's LIVED it.

🔥 Your health journey is your qualification. You've BEEN where they are.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know about nutrition now that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
