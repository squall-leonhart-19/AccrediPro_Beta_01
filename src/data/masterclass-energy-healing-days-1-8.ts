TODAY'S LESSON: Your Sensitivity Is Your Greatest Gift

Here's what I wish someone told me years ago...

You don't need a mystical awakening. You don't need 10 years of training. You don't need to be a guru.

Your SENSITIVITY - feeling drained in crowded places, picking up on others' emotions, knowing when something's "off" - THAT is what makes you a natural healer.

Think about it honestly:

Would you rather work with someone who read about energy in a textbook... or someone who actually FEELS it?

Exactly.

Your "too sensitive" becomes your SUPERPOWER.
Your "overwhelm" becomes your GIFT.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down 3 times your sensitivity helped you understand something others missed. These become your "I understand you" stories.

Tomorrow: How to find your FIRST 3 CLIENTS (they're already in your life).

TODAY'S LESSON: Your First 3 Clients Are Already In Your Life

Stop scrolling Instagram looking for strangers.

1️⃣ THE YOGA/WELLNESS FRIEND - The woman who mentioned she always feels drained

2️⃣ THE STRESSED COWORKER - Someone who complains about exhaustion despite sleeping

3️⃣ THE FAMILY MEMBER'S FRIEND - Your sister's friend, daughter's colleague going through something

THE EXACT SCRIPT:
"Hey [name], I know you've been feeling drained lately. I'm building my energy healing practice and looking for 3 people to work with. Would you be open to a free 20-minute energy assessment?"

No fancy marketing. No dancing on TikTok.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Text ONE person today with the script above.

TODAY'S LESSON: Charging What Your Energy Work Is Worth

Let me guess... you're thinking "I should do this for free - it's a spiritual gift"

Here's the TRUTH:
❌ FREE clients don't value the session
❌ FREE clients cancel last minute
❌ FREE clients don't do the integration work
❌ FREE clients drain YOUR energy

✅ PAYING clients are invested
✅ PAYING clients show up ready
✅ PAYING clients become testimonials

When someone PAYS, they PAY ATTENTION.

THE PRICING FRAMEWORK:
• Discovery Call: FREE (15-20 min)
• Single Session: $97-$150
• 4-Session Package: $297-$397
• 3-Month Transformation: $997-$1,497

Energy work is VALUABLE. An exchange of energy (money) honors the work.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Decide on your first package price. Say it out loud 5 times.

    {
        day: 4, gap: "legal", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Legal Protection Made Simple

All you actually need:

✅ 1. CLIENT INTAKE FORM - Current symptoms, what they've tried, energy concerns

✅ 2. INFORMED CONSENT - "I am not a medical practitioner. This is energy wellness support, not medical treatment."

✅ 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE - You facilitate energy balancing, NOT diagnose or prescribe

THAT'S IT.

You don't need an LLC (nice later), expensive insurance (get it when earning), or a lawyer.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Download the templates. Add your name. Done.

📎 Downloads in Resources:
• "Client Intake Form" (PDF)
• "Informed Consent Template" (DOC)

TODAY'S LESSON: Finding Your Energy-Sensitive Clients

YOUR IDEAL CLIENTS ARE NOT ON TIKTOK.

They're:
📌 In Facebook groups for chronic fatigue, empaths, sensitive souls
📌 At yoga studios, wellness centers, holistic health shops
📌 Looking for someone they TRUST and FEEL safe with

YOUR MARKETING:
1️⃣ FACEBOOK - Join empath/wellness groups. Add value. No pitching.
2️⃣ WORD OF MOUTH - Every person you help tells 3 others
3️⃣ LOCAL PRESENCE - Speak at yoga studios, wellness fairs, women's groups
4️⃣ COFFEE CHATS - 2 women/week. Just connect heart to heart.

No algorithms. No hashtags.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Join 2 Facebook groups for empaths or wellness seekers. Introduce yourself authentically.

WEEK 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

Let's address that voice...

"Who am I to do energy work?"
"What if I'm not gifted enough?"
"I'm not a real healer"

HERE'S THE TRUTH:

🔥 You don't need to be a psychic. You need to be ONE STEP AHEAD.

🔥 Your SENSITIVITY is your gift. Clients don't want a guru - they want someone who UNDERSTANDS.

🔥 Your struggles are your qualification. You've FELT what they feel.

THE IMPOSTER TEST:
Would the "you" from 5 years ago have PAID for guidance from the current you?

YES → You're qualified to help someone where you used to be.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write 3 things you know now about energy that you wish you knew 5 years ago.
