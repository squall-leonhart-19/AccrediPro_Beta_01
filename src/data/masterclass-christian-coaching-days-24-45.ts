TODAY'S LESSON: Knowledge Without Action Is Just Entertainment

You know a LOT now. Let's be honest.

You know:
• How to find clients
• How to price (stewardship!)
• How to run coaching sessions
• How to get referrals
• What to say, what not to say

The question is: What will you DO with it?

Information → Implementation = Transformation

"Faith without works is dead." - James 2:26

THE 1-THING METHOD:

What's ONE thing you'll implement TODAY?

Not tomorrow. Not "this week." TODAY.

Example:
• Text ONE person about your practice
• Set up Calendly
• Post ONE thing on Facebook about your calling
• Complete your intake form
• Practice your pricing out loud

ONE thing. Small. Doable. NOW.

Motion creates emotion. Action creates confidence.

Stop learning. Start DOING.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Reply to this message with YOUR one thing. Accountability works.

        day: 25, gap: "testimonial-system", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Getting Testimonials (Without Being Awkward)

Social proof is EVERYTHING. But asking for testimonials feels weird.

Here's how to make it easy:

WHEN TO ASK:
After a WIN. Not after 6 months. After they have ANY breakthrough.
• "I finally have clarity about my calling!"
• "I feel closer to God than ever!"
• "I made the decision I was avoiding!"

IMMEDIATELY say: "That's so beautiful! Would you mind writing a quick testimony about your experience? Just 2-3 sentences would mean the world to me."

THE EASY TEMPLATE FOR THEM:
"Before working with [you], I felt [lost/stuck/confused about my calling]. After [timeframe], I [specific result]. I would recommend [you] because [reason]."

Send them this template. They fill in blanks. Done.

WHERE TO USE THEM:
• Facebook posts
• Discovery call prep ("Read what my clients say...")
• Website/sales page
• Referral follow-ups

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
If you've helped ANYONE (even for free), ask for a testimony today. Use the template.

TODAY'S LESSON: Your 1-Page Website (30 Minutes)

You don't need a fancy website. You need ONE PAGE that:
• Says who you help
• Shows your face
• Explains what you offer
• Has a button to book

THE 5 SECTIONS:

1. HERO: Your photo + headline
"I help Christian women discover their God-given calling and step into their purpose"

2. STORY: 2-3 sentences about your journey
"After years of feeling called but stuck, I found my path through faith-aligned coaching..."

3. SERVICES: What you offer
4-Week Purpose Alignment Journey - $297

4. TESTIMONIES: 2-3 quotes from clients
Even if informal. Even if from free clients.

5. CALL TO ACTION: One button
"Book Your Free Discovery Call" → Calendly link

THAT'S IT.

Use Canva, Carrd ($9/year), or WordPress.

Perfect is the enemy of done. Simple website that exists > beautiful website in your head.

    {
        day: 27, gap: "boundaries", sarah: `Hey {firstName}! 👋

TODAY'S LESSON: Setting Godly Boundaries With Clients

As you help more women, you'll encounter:
• "Can I text you anytime I'm struggling?"
• "I know we're done but just one more thing..."
• "Can we do a call at 10pm?"
• "I need you to be available for my emergencies"

Setting boundaries isn't unloving. It's WISE and sustainable for long-term ministry.

THE BOUNDARIES TO SET (From Day 1):

📱 COMMUNICATION:
"I respond to messages within 24-48 hours. For mental health emergencies, please contact a crisis line or your pastor."

⏰ AVAILABILITY:
"I hold sessions Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm. I honor the Sabbath and family time on weekends."

💬 SCOPE:
"Our work focuses on faith-aligned life coaching - purpose, calling, decisions. For deeper spiritual counseling, I'll connect you with pastoral support."

📧 RESPONSE TIME:
"I check messages once per day to protect my own quiet time with God. You'll always hear back within 48 hours."

Put these in your welcome email. Set expectations BEFORE they're violated.

"Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it." - Proverbs 4:23

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down your top 3 boundaries. Add them to your intake process.

        day: 28, gap: "time-management", sarah: `Morning {firstName}! ☀️

TODAY'S LESSON: Time Management for Busy Women of Faith

You have kids. Or grandkids. Or aging parents. Or a job. Or church commitments. Or all of the above.

Time is limited. Here's how to make it work:

THE BATCH METHOD:

Instead of doing a little every day (exhausting), batch similar tasks:

• CONTENT DAY: One afternoon, create a week's worth of posts
• SESSION DAY: Stack all your coaching sessions on 2 days
• ADMIN DAY: Handle emails, scheduling, invoicing all at once

THE PROTECTED HOURS:

Block specific hours that are NON-NEGOTIABLE for your kingdom business:
• 5:30-6:30am devotion + business (before anyone needs you)
• 12:00-12:30pm lunch break
• 8:00-9:00pm after kids are down

These are YOURS. No guilt. God-honoring stewardship of time.

THE 80/20 RULE:

20% of your activities create 80% of results.

High ROI: Discovery calls, coaching sessions, referral asks
Low ROI: Scrolling Instagram, "researching," reorganizing files

Do MORE of the 20%. Let go of the rest.

"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." - Ecclesiastes 3:1

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Block your "protected hours" in your calendar for this week.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Real Question

After almost a month together, I need to ask you something important...

Are you treating this as a HOBBY or a CALLING?

There's no wrong answer. But they require different approaches.

HOBBY:
• Help friends and family for free
• No pressure to get clients
• Learn at your own pace
• Maybe make some side income eventually

CALLING:
• Building an actual coaching ministry
• Serving women consistently
• Getting paying clients
• Replacing or supplementing your income
• Doing this for REAL - answering what God put on your heart

Both are valid.

But only one leads to the life you feel CALLED to.

If you're choosing CALLING...

You need:
✅ Skills (you have them now)
✅ Systems (you have them now)
✅ Knowledge (you have it now)
✅ CREDIBILITY (this is what's missing)

Tomorrow I'll explain exactly what I mean.

For now - be honest with yourself and God. Which are you choosing?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write down: "I am treating this as a ___________" and why.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Only Thing Left

Here's where you are right now:

✅ You know how to find clients (church, Bible study, referrals)
✅ You know how to price ($297-$497 programs)
✅ You know how to run sessions (G.R.A.C.E. Method)
✅ You know the legal stuff (intake forms, disclaimers)
✅ You know the tech (Calendly, Stripe, Zoom)
✅ You know how to share your calling (Facebook, church, word of mouth)
✅ You know how to handle imposter syndrome
✅ You know your scope of practice
✅ You know how to get referrals and testimonies

You have EVERYTHING you need...

...except ONE thing.

THE CREDENTIAL.

Here's why it matters for Christian coaching:

🔐 PROFESSIONAL LEGITIMACY: Official certification provides documentation of your training

💼 POSITIONING: "Certified Christian Life Coach" vs "someone from church who gives advice"

🙏 GROUNDING: Certification makes your practice feel REAL and structured, not just "good intentions"

👥 CLIENT TRUST: Clients choose certified coaches - it removes their uncertainty

💰 PRICING POWER: Certified coaches charge 2-3x more than uncertified

Without the credential, you have gifts.
With the credential, you have a MINISTRY-PRACTICE.

This is the gap.

Tomorrow: How to close it.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Stewardship Math That Changes Everything

Let's do the math together...

CAREER ACCELERATOR INVESTMENT: $297

YOUR FIRST CLIENT:
• 4-Week Purpose Alignment Journey = $297
• ONE client = Investment recovered ✅

YOUR THIRD CLIENT:
• 3 x $297 = $891
• Profit after investment: $594

YOUR FIRST YEAR (Conservative):
• 2 clients/month x 12 months = 24 clients
• 24 x $297 = $7,128
• Investment: $297
• ROI: 2,400% return

This isn't theory. This is what our graduates are actually doing.

Grace started 8 months ago. She now makes $4,900/month.
Donna started 6 months ago. She makes $2,800/month.
Theresa started 4 months ago. She just hit $1,400/month.

They all started EXACTLY where you are.

The difference? They saw the stewardship math and made the decision.

"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.'" - Matthew 25:23

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Calculate: If you got just 2 clients per month at your price point, what would that equal in a year?

TODAY'S LESSON: Meet Grace - From Pastor's Wife to $4,900/Month Doing Kingdom Work

I want to introduce you to someone special...

Grace joined the Career Accelerator 8 months ago. Here's her story:

BEFORE:
• 52 years old, Pastor's wife for 24 years
• Burned out from unpaid ministry work
• Felt guilty about wanting to get paid
• "What would the church think?"

THE TURNING POINT:
• Realized stewardship means MULTIPLYING gifts, not just giving them away
• "The Proverbs 31 woman ran a BUSINESS"
• "If I can help other women find their calling professionally..."

NOW (8 months later):
• $4,900/month income (part-time, 12 hours/week)
• 10 active clients
• Waitlist of 5 more
• Husband now sees it as real ministry
• "I'm finally using my gifts AND providing for my family"

HER ADVICE TO YOU:
"I spent 24 years giving away what God gave me for free. I thought that was 'humble.' But stewardship isn't about burial - it's about multiplication. Don't wait. Your calling is waiting. Step into it."

Grace is real. Her results are real. And she started EXACTLY where you are.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Watch Grace's full story in the Resources section.

    },

TODAY'S LESSON: Why Support Makes All The Difference

Here's what I wish someone told me when I started...

You can have all the calling in the world. But without SUPPORT, you'll struggle alone.

WHAT CAREER ACCELERATOR GIVES YOU:

👩‍🏫 WEEKLY GROUP CALLS
• Live Q&A with me every week
• Ask anything - pricing, clients, struggles
• Real-time feedback and guidance
• Never feel stuck alone

📚 DONE-FOR-YOU MATERIALS
• Session templates
• Intake forms
• Email scripts
• Social media posts
• All customized for Christian coaching

👥 PRIVATE COMMUNITY
• Other certified Christian coaches
• Share wins and challenges
• Accountability partners
• Referral network
• Prayer support

📞 1:1 SUPPORT
• Direct message access to me

The difference between struggling for years and succeeding in months? SUPPORT.

I tried to do this alone first. I wasted 2 years fumbling. When I finally got a mentor, everything changed.

Don't make my mistake.

TODAY'S LESSON: Let's Talk About What's Stopping You

I want to be real with you today...

After 36 days together, something is holding you back. And I want to help you work through it.

THE TOP OBJECTIONS I HEAR:

💸 "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"
I get it. Money feels tight. Here's the truth: $297 is ONE client. If you can't find ONE client with everything I've taught you, this isn't the right path. But if you CAN... the investment pays for itself immediately.

⏰ "I DON'T HAVE TIME"
Neither do my graduates. They have kids, jobs, aging parents, church commitments. They found 5-10 hours/week. The question isn't time - it's PRIORITY. If God is calling you, you'll make time.

😰 "I'M NOT READY"
You never will be. I wasn't ready. Grace wasn't ready. Nobody feels ready. Readiness comes from STARTING, not waiting.

👨 "MY FAMILY/CHURCH DOESN'T UNDERSTAND"
Then show them the stewardship math. 2 clients = $594. 24 clients/year = $7,128. Show them this is biblical business AND kingdom calling.

🤔 "WHAT IF I FAIL?"
What if you succeed? What if this is your calling? The only guaranteed failure is ignoring what God put on your heart.

Which one is YOUR objection?

Reply with YOUR #1 concern. I'll personally help you work through it.

⏰ IMPORTANT TIMING UPDATE

Your special scholarship pricing expires in 8 days.

I'm not saying this to pressure you. I'm saying it because I don't want you to miss it and then regret it later.

WHAT CHANGES AFTER DAY 45:
• Career Accelerator: $297 → $997
• DFY Business Kit: $497 → $997
• Scholarship consideration closed
• Bonus Q&A calls removed

WHAT STAYS THE SAME:
• Mini-Diploma certificate (yours forever)
• Community access (always welcome)
• Lesson access (permanent)

I won't send 10 reminder emails. I'll mention it a few more times, and then it's up to you and God.

The women who succeed aren't superhuman. They just DECIDE and ACT when the window is open.

Just wanted you to know where we are in the timeline.

TODAY'S LESSON: See Your Future Self

I want you to do something with me...

Close your eyes. Take a breath. Pray. Now picture yourself 6 months from now:

IMAGINE...
• Your phone buzzes - it's a client booking confirmation
• You check your Stripe dashboard - $1,400 came in this week
• You're sitting in your sacred office space (finally set up the way you wanted)
• You just finished a session and your client is in tears - breakthrough tears
• You look at your calendar - only working 15 hours this week
• You feel PURPOSE. You feel CALLED. You feel ALIGNED with God's plan.

This isn't fantasy. This is what our graduates actually experience.

6 months ago, Grace was burned out from unpaid ministry.
Now she makes $4,900/month and helps women find their calling.

6 months ago, Donna thought she was "too old" to follow her calling.
Now she has 8 clients and a waiting list.

You are 6 months away from a completely different life.

The question is: Will you answer the call?

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Write a letter from your future self, 6 months from now. What does she want to tell you today?

6 days left.

I'm not going to pressure you. But I also don't want you to have regrets.

Here's what I know after helping hundreds of women:

THE WAIT TRAP:
"I'll do it next month..."
"After the holidays..."
"When things calm down..."
"When I have more saved..."

Things never calm down. There's never a perfect time. The women who wait usually end up in the same unfulfilled place a year later, wishing they'd started.

THE DECISION TRAP:
Not deciding IS a decision.
Waiting IS an action.
And both have consequences for your calling.

I've seen it too many times:
• "I meant to sign up but forgot" → Paid $700 more
• "I'll do the next round" → Lost momentum, never came back
• "Life got in the way" → Stayed stuck in unfulfilling work for another year

You've invested 39 days. You've learned everything you need.

The only thing left is the DECISION.

6 days.

We're entering the FINAL WEEK of your Mini-Diploma journey.

Quick recap of where you are:

MONTH 1 COMPLETE:
✅ 40 lessons completed
✅ Skills for running coaching sessions
✅ Systems for getting clients
✅ Knowledge for helping women grow in faith
✅ Community of women supporting you

WHAT HAPPENS NOW:

OPTION 1: Career Accelerator
Get certified. Access DFY materials. Join weekly calls. Build your real ministry-practice with full support.

OPTION 2: Go Solo
Take what you learned and figure out the rest yourself. Always valid.

OPTION 3: Wait
Let life get busy. Forget about this. Come back in 6 months when you're "ready." (Most people choose this. Most people stay stuck.)

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to be honest.

The women making $3K-$6K/month aren't superhuman. They DECIDED and TRUSTED GOD.

5 days left to decide.

4 days left.

I want to share something personal with you...

When I was at your stage, I almost didn't take the leap. I had every excuse:
• "Maybe next month"
• "I need to save more"
• "What if nobody wants my help?"
• "Who am I to do this?"

The day I finally said YES - shaking, uncertain, terrified - was the day everything changed.

Not because I suddenly became confident.
Not because I had all the answers.
Not because I felt "ready."

But because I DECIDED that my calling was worth more than my fear.

The graduates making $3,000-$6,000/month aren't superhuman. They're not more gifted than you. They don't have advantages you don't have.

The ONLY difference: They said YES when they were scared.

You've completed 41 days of training. You've learned everything you need.

The question isn't CAN you do this.

The question is WILL you.

4 days.

Sarah 💛`,

This message is different.

I'm not going to teach you anything today. I just want to talk to you, personally.

{firstName} - I've watched you show up for 42 days. That takes commitment. That takes discipline. That takes HEART.

Most people don't make it this far. Most people quit by Day 7.

Not you.

So here's my personal invitation:

I want you in the Career Accelerator.

Not because I need another sale.
Not because of the revenue.

Because I've SEEN your commitment. I know your heart for serving others (or at least I can feel it). And I believe God has equipped you to do this for real.

Sister to sister: Join us.

Bring everything you've learned. Bring your fears. Bring your doubts. Bring your questions.

And let's build this kingdom work together.

The door is open for 3 more days.

With belief in you,
Sarah 💛

P.S. - If you have ANY questions, reply to this message. I'll personally respond.`,

48 hours.

That's what's left.

I want to ask you something, and I want you to really pray on it:

Do you believe in your calling?

Not "do you think you MIGHT be able to do this someday."
Not "maybe if everything goes perfectly."

Do you BELIEVE - deep in your spirit - that God has called you to help women and build a coaching ministry?

If the answer is yes (even a scared, uncertain yes)...

Then the only thing standing between you and your purpose is the DECISION.

I believe in you. I've watched you for 43 days. I've seen your commitment.

The question is: Do YOU believe in your calling?

48 hours to decide.
