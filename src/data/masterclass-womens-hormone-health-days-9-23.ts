TODAY'S LESSON: The Big 5 Hormones Every Coach Must Know

Most women think menopause = hot flashes. WRONG.

Here are the 5 hormones that control EVERYTHING:

1️⃣ ESTROGEN - Not just reproductive. Affects brain, bones, heart, skin, mood. When it drops, everything changes.

2️⃣ PROGESTERONE - The "calm" hormone. First to decline in perimenopause. Goodbye sleep, hello anxiety.

3️⃣ TESTOSTERONE - Yes women have it! Affects energy, libido, muscle, motivation. Most overlooked hormone in women.

4️⃣ CORTISOL - Stress hormone that STEALS from other hormones. The #1 disruptor.

5️⃣ THYROID (T3/T4) - Controls metabolism. Often goes wonky during perimenopause and gets misdiagnosed.

When you understand these 5, you understand 90% of what your clients are experiencing.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Identify which of the Big 5 was YOUR biggest issue. That's likely your specialty niche.

TODAY'S LESSON: Introducing the B.L.O.O.M. Method

This is your SECRET WEAPON as a hormone health coach.

B - BASELINE → Assess where she is right now (symptoms, lifestyle, stress level)
L - LISTEN → Really hear her story. What has she tried? What has she been told? What does she FEEL?
O - OPTIMIZE → Target the 3 biggest needle-movers for HER situation
O - OBSERVE → Track progress, adjust, notice patterns
M - MAINTAIN → Build sustainable habits that support hormonal health long-term

WHY THIS WORKS:
❌ Doctors: 7-minute appointments. One-size-fits-all.
✅ YOU: Deep listening. Personalized protocols. Ongoing support.

You don't need to know everything. You need a FRAMEWORK.
B.L.O.O.M. is your framework.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Practice B.L.O.O.M. on yourself. Write your own Baseline assessment.

TODAY'S LESSON: Nutrition That Actually Supports Hormones

STOP telling women to "eat less, move more." That DESTROYS hormones after 40.

HORMONE-SUPPORTING NUTRITION:

🥩 PROTEIN - 30g per meal minimum. Stabilizes blood sugar → stabilizes hormones.

🥑 HEALTHY FATS - Avocado, olive oil, nuts. Hormones are MADE from fat. Low-fat diets = low hormones.

🥦 CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES - Broccoli, cauliflower, kale. Help metabolize excess estrogen.

🫙 FERMENTED FOODS - Gut health = hormone health. Sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt.

❌ STOP: Excess sugar, alcohol, caffeine after 2pm, processed foods

THE 80/20 RULE: 80% whole foods, 20% life. No perfection needed.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Help your practice client assess their Big 4: protein, fats, cruciferous, fermented.

TODAY'S LESSON: Sleep & Hormones — The Hidden Connection

Night sweats at 3am? Insomnia? Waking up exhausted?

It's NOT just "poor sleep hygiene." It's HORMONAL.

THE SLEEP-HORMONE CONNECTION:
🌙 Progesterone drops → can't fall asleep
🌙 Estrogen drops → night sweats wake you up
🌙 Cortisol spikes → wide awake at 3am with racing thoughts

YOUR CLIENT'S SLEEP PROTOCOL:
1. MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE - 400mg before bed (nature's sleep aid)
2. COOL ROOM - 65°F. Hot flashes need cool air.
3. NO SCREENS 60 MIN BEFORE BED - Blue light suppresses melatonin
4. TART CHERRY JUICE - Natural melatonin source
5. WICKING PAJAMAS - Game changer for night sweats

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Try the sleep protocol yourself for 3 nights. Track results.

TODAY'S LESSON: The Cortisol Steal — Why Stress Destroys Hormones

This is the #1 thing conventional doctors MISS.

THE CORTISOL STEAL:
When your body is stressed, it prioritizes survival.

It literally STEALS resources from:
❌ Progesterone production → anxiety, insomnia
❌ Thyroid function → metabolism crashes
❌ Estrogen balance → symptoms worsen
❌ Testosterone → zero energy, zero libido

CORTISOL ALWAYS WINS. Your body doesn't care about your hot flashes when it thinks you're in danger.

STRESS MANAGEMENT IS HORMONE MANAGEMENT.

FOR YOUR CLIENTS:
1. Morning cortisol reset: 10 min sunlight within 30 min of waking
2. Afternoon cortisol dip: 5-minute breathing exercise at 2pm
3. Evening cortisol wind-down: No news, no arguments, no email after 7pm

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Do the 3-step cortisol reset yourself today.

TODAY'S LESSON: Exercise After 40 — Everything You Were Told Is WRONG

STOP:
❌ 60-minute cardio sessions (raises cortisol → steals hormones)
❌ Restricting calories AND exercising hard (double stress on depleted hormones)
❌ HIIT every day (too much stress for perimenopausal body)

START:
✅ STRENGTH TRAINING 3x/week - Builds muscle, supports testosterone, boosts metabolism
✅ WALKING 30min/day - Lowers cortisol without stressing hormones
✅ YOGA/STRETCHING 2x/week - Activates parasympathetic nervous system
✅ HIIT only 1-2x/week MAX during perimenopause

THE SHIFT: From "punishing your body into shape" to "supporting your body through transition"

This is HUGE for your clients. Most have been over-exercising and under-eating for YEARS.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Go for a 30-minute walk. Notice how different it feels from forcing a workout.

TODAY'S LESSON: Supplements That Actually Help (And Ones That Don't)

Your clients are spending HUNDREDS on supplements that don't work.

THE EVIDENCE-BASED ESSENTIALS:
✅ MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE (400mg) - Sleep, mood, cramps, stress
✅ VITAMIN D3 + K2 - Most women are deficient. Affects EVERYTHING.
✅ OMEGA-3 (EPA/DHA) - Inflammation, brain fog, mood
✅ B-COMPLEX - Energy, methylation, detox pathways
✅ PROBIOTICS - Gut-hormone connection

NICE TO HAVE:
🟡 Ashwagandha - Cortisol support
🟡 Black Cohosh - Hot flash relief (mixed evidence)
🟡 DIM - Estrogen metabolism support

SKIP:
❌ Random "hormone balance" blends
❌ Anything with proprietary blends
❌ $200/month supplement stacks from MLMs

IMPORTANT: Always check medication interactions. Stay in your scope.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Review YOUR supplement stack. How does it compare?

TODAY'S LESSON: The 4 Stages of Perimenopause Nobody Talks About

Most women think menopause happens overnight. WRONG.

STAGE 1: EARLY PERI (ages 38-42 typically)
• Cycles still regular but PMS worsens
• Sleep starts getting disrupted
• Anxiety appears "out of nowhere"
• Progesterone begins declining

STAGE 2: MID PERI (ages 42-47)
• Cycles become irregular
• Hot flashes begin
• Brain fog hits
• Weight shifts to midsection
• Mood swings intensify

STAGE 3: LATE PERI (ages 47-51)
• Cycles very irregular or very heavy
• Symptoms peak
• Joint pain, fatigue, low libido
• Full hormonal rollercoaster

STAGE 4: MENOPAUSE (12 months no period)
• Symptoms may reduce OR continue
• Post-menopause health focus shifts
• Bone density, heart health, cognitive health become priorities

KNOWING THE STAGE = KNOWING THE APPROACH.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Identify your own stage. Then practice staging a fictional client.

TODAY'S LESSON: Symptom Tracking — Your Secret Weapon

What gets MEASURED gets IMPROVED.

YOUR CLIENT TRACKING SYSTEM:

📊 DAILY SYMPTOM LOG:
Rate 1-10: Energy, mood, sleep quality, hot flashes, brain fog
Track: Exercise, food quality, stress level, supplements taken

📈 WEEKLY REVIEW:
• What improved?
• What worsened?
• What changed in lifestyle?
• Patterns noticed?

📋 MONTHLY AUDIT:
• Compare to baseline
• Adjust protocol
• Celebrate wins (even small ones!)

TOOLS:
• Simple Google Sheet (template provided)
• or Pen & paper (some clients prefer analog!)

When clients SEE their progress on paper, they STAY committed.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Start tracking your OWN symptoms today. Lead by example.

TODAY'S LESSON: Handling Difficult Client Situations

You WILL encounter these. Here's your playbook:

1️⃣ "MY DOCTOR SAYS I'M FINE"
→ "Your doctor is looking at disease ranges. We look at OPTIMAL ranges. Both perspectives are valuable."

2️⃣ "I WANT TO TRY HRT"
→ "That's a conversation with your doctor. My role is to support you with nutrition and lifestyle alongside whatever medical decisions you make."

3️⃣ "NOTHING WORKS FOR ME"
→ B.L.O.O.M. Baseline first. Usually there's a cortisol issue or missing piece they haven't addressed.

4️⃣ "HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM GOOGLE?"
→ "Google gives generic information. I give you a personalized protocol based on YOUR symptoms, YOUR stage, and YOUR lifestyle."

5️⃣ "ARE YOU A DOCTOR?"
→ "No, and I don't pretend to be. I'm a certified hormone health specialist. I focus on the nutrition and lifestyle piece that doctors don't have time for."

CONFIDENCE = COMPETENCE + PRACTICE.

🎯 TODAY'S ACTION:
Role-play these 5 scenarios with a friend.
