You are stepping into one of the most rewarding and rapidly growing niches in the entire wellness industry. Pet parents are spending more than ever on their furry family members, and they are increasingly realizing that the food they put in the bowl is the single biggest factor in their pet's health, energy, and longevity. The problem is that most pet owners have no idea what they are feeding their animals, and most veterinarians receive almost no nutrition training in school. That gap is where you come in."
