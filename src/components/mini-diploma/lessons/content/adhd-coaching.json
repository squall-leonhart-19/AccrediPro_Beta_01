You are stepping into one of the most impactful and desperately needed coaching specialties in the world right now. Over 300 million adults worldwide have ADHD, and most of them are not getting the support they need. Therapists focus on emotions. Doctors focus on medication. But who helps ADHD adults build the practical systems, strategies, and structures that actually make daily life work? That is you. That is what an ADHD coach does. And the world cannot train them fast enough."

It is not a character flaw. It is not laziness. It is not something people can just 'try harder' to overcome. The ADHD brain is structurally and chemically different from a neurotypical brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and in the production of **dopamine and norepinephrine**, the neurotransmitters that regulate attention, motivation, and reward."

Medication helps many people, but it does not teach the practical skills, systems, and strategies that adults need to manage work, relationships, finances, and daily life. Therapists address the emotional impact of ADHD, but most are not trained to provide the practical, action-oriented coaching that creates real-world change. ADHD coaches fill this critical gap. The market is growing at 25 percent or more annually, ADHD coaches typically charge $150 to $300 per session, and many have waitlists within their first year of practice. You are entering this field at exactly the right time."

The key is to use the same tools you will teach your clients: external accountability, time boxing, body doubling, visual systems, and simple structures. Many of the most successful ADHD coaches in the world have ADHD themselves. They design ADHD-friendly businesses with flexible schedules, clear systems, and built-in accountability. Your D.E.P.T.H. Method training gives you both the coaching framework AND the business structure to succeed with an ADHD brain. You do not need to be neurotypical to change lives. You just need to be trained, committed, and willing to practice what you preach."
