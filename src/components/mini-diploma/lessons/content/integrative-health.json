Here is the reality: the current medical system is brilliant at acute care. Broken bones, infections, surgeries — no one does it better. But for chronic conditions — autoimmune diseases, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, persistent pain, anxiety disorders — the conventional model falls apart. Patients see five, six, seven specialists. Nobody talks to each other. Nobody looks at the whole picture. That is where you come in. The integrative health practitioner is the bridge between conventional medicine and holistic healing — and the world desperately needs more of them."
