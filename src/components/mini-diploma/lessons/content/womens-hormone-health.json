You are about to specialize in one of the most deeply personal and desperately underserved areas of women's wellness. From puberty to postmenopause, women's hormones drive nearly every aspect of how they feel, think, look, and function — yet the medical system treats hormonal health as an afterthought. Women are gaslit, dismissed, and told to 'just deal with it.' You are about to become the specialist who finally gives them answers."

When the gut, liver, or detox pathways are compromised, estrogen gets recycled and builds up — causing estrogen dominance symptoms like heavy periods, breast tenderness, fibroids, mood swings, and weight gain around the hips.",

After finding relief through nutrition and lifestyle changes, she got certified as a Women's Hormone Health Specialist. She started with the women in her yoga classes — many of whom were in their 40s and 50s and dealing with the same symptoms. She offered free assessments and launched a Perimenopause Support Group. Within 6 months she had 18 individual clients and was running her second group cohort. Total monthly income: $9,200. She still teaches 2 yoga classes per week because she loves it — not because she needs the money."
