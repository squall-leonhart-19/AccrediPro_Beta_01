The word itself comes from two Japanese words: **Rei** meaning universal or spiritual wisdom, and **Ki** meaning life force energy. You are not using your own energy to heal others. You are acting as a **channel** for universal energy, which is why Reiki practitioners do not get drained from sessions. In fact, most practitioners feel more energized after giving a treatment."
