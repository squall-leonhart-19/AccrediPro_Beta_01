- **Mood Factory** - 95% of serotonin made here
- **Hormone Regulator** - Affects thyroid, estrogen, cortisol

Here's the thing: You don't need to be a scientist. You need to understand PATTERNS.

When I started, I didn't know what "dysbiosis" meant either. But I learned:
- Bloating after meals? = Gut issue
- Brain fog + fatigue? = Gut issue
- Skin problems? = Often gut issue
- Mood swings? = Gut-brain connection

You're not diagnosing diseases. You're recognizing patterns and guiding people to solutions.

- 12 gut health clients
- $175/session, 2 sessions/month each
- Monthly recurring: $4,200
- Waitlist of 8 people

My clients call me their 'gut guru.' I don't have a medical degree. I have lived experience and the right training.

- When damaged → "Leaky Gut" → inflammation everywhere
- Signs: food sensitivities, joint pain, skin issues

**2. THE MICROBIOME (The Army)**
- Trillions of bacteria living in your gut
- Good vs bad bacteria balance
- Affects digestion, immunity, mood, weight
- Signs of imbalance: bloating, gas, irregular bowels

**3. THE MOTILITY (The Movement)**
- How food moves through your system
- Too slow → constipation, toxin buildup
- Too fast → diarrhea, nutrient loss
- Signs: irregular bathroom habits, discomfort

Imagine your gut lining is a window screen:

**Healthy Screen:**
- Tiny holes let air through (nutrients)
- Keeps bugs out (toxins, undigested food)

**Damaged Screen (Leaky Gut):**
- Holes get bigger
- Bugs get in (bad stuff enters bloodstream)
- Immune system panics
- Inflammation spreads EVERYWHERE

**What damages the screen?**
- Gluten (for many people)
- Chronic stress
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, aspirin)
- Alcohol
- Poor diet

This is why someone with leaky gut might have joint pain, brain fog, skin issues, AND digestive problems. The inflammation goes everywhere.

**2. REPLACE** - Add what's missing
- Digestive enzymes, HCl, bile support
- "What does digestion need to work?"

**3. REINOCULATE** - Restore good bacteria
- Probiotics, prebiotics, fermented foods
- "Rebuild the good army"

**4. REPAIR** - Heal the gut lining
- L-glutamine, zinc, collagen, bone broth
- "Fix the damaged screen"

- Sleep, stress management, movement

As a health coach, here's exactly what you CAN and CAN'T do:

**YOU CAN:**
✓ Educate on the 5R protocol
✓ Suggest dietary changes
✓ Recommend supplements (not prescribe)
✓ Guide on lifestyle modifications
✓ Support accountability
✓ Help interpret (not diagnose) symptoms

**DOCTORS DO:**
- Order and interpret medical tests
- Diagnose conditions like SIBO, IBD, Crohn's
- Prescribe medications
- Treat acute medical conditions

Client suspects gut issue → You educate and support → They work with doctor for testing → You help implement healing protocol

Gut healing takes TIME. That means ongoing client relationships.

Month 1-2: Remove phase + initial support

Month 3-4: Reinoculate + Repair
- 4 sessions @ $175 = $700

Month 5-6: Optimize + Maintain
- 2 sessions @ $175 = $350

**Total per client: $1,750 over 6 months**

Now multiply:
- 5 clients = $8,750 over 6 months
- 10 clients = $17,500 over 6 months

And they REFER friends because they finally feel better.
