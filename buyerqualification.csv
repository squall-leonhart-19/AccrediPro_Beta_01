Tell me your story — what brought you here today? Why did investing in this certification feel right in your heart?
I want to help people learn how to heal themselves. As a health coach I can help people understand proper nutrition practices and health protocols to ensure a healthy lifestyle.
I think we’ve covered this before enrollment! 😊 I have to say that your personal attention to my inquiry was a large part of my decision to take this step. I truly feel supported. In a nutshell, in order to care for my husband currently undergoing chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, I had to leave my job at the hospital as an Ultrasound technologist in May this year. I’d really love to build on my healthcare background to help people struggling with health problems while staying home with him at this time. Who knows what the future will bring!
I am a retired nurse who has experienced a lot of different types of nursing and all were good. Now retired I was looking for something to fill the void that was part of my life for 40 years. Whatever I was searching for was not to include a 5 AM alarm, a 2 hour a day commute, and no weekends or holidays. Don't misunderstand though, I do not mind putting my heart and soul into my work. At this point of my life I would like it to be on my terms not to be so selfish. I am a certified health coach. I passed the exam last year but have not worked at this yet. I put things in place but have not marketed and so on. Your introduction was very interesting. I am someone who loves to evaluate and analyze things. I love to problem solve. Although I love many aspects of nursing, I truly love working with behavioral health or women's health. I decided that this may be what I need to move forward, and am hoping that this will take me where I want to go. Unfortunately now older, I can see it is harder for me to learn than when younger. I will need to put in the extra but that is fine with me. With the holidays coming I may be limited on some time since we will be going away for a week and having family visit for another week but I will certainly do my best. Thank. you for letting me express myself.   Diane
I’m an ARNP of 25 years and am completely burned out on traditional healthcare dictated by health insurance agencies. I want to be paid what my knowledge and experience is worth. In order to do that, I need to learn your process.
I am a Registered Nurse working in Med-Surg at an Acute Care Hospital, with 12-hour shifts. I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and strongly believe that if I were able to do all the things your course is offering, I would have been better able to help myself. So, here I am hungry and thirsty to learn all I can so I can help myself and others.
This program felt like something I could do that would help others as well as myself. This is an area that I find interesting and now is the right time to take the leap into this. I feel it's a field people would benefit from, but aren't aware is out there. I want to be that person who provides what they need to move on to better health
I’ve been thinking about doing something like this for years.  I’ve looked into other options, but couldn’t afford it as I had kids still at home.  I have hashimotos and am into post menopause.  My “naturopathic “ dr wants to put me on bhrt - but can not really explain how it can help me… besides telling me it will help with my fatigue.  I really want to learn about myself, and also root causes.  And help others if I can get the confidence in myself.  Thank you for making this affordable!
.
I’m a nurse, very disappointed in the sick care healthcare protocols. I’ve been trying to talk to people about nutrition lifestyle changes for years. And I’ve been hearing that functional medicine is the way to go to get to the root cause of problems. I’m tired of hospital doctors just putting Band-Aids on everything Basically symptom management. And all the specialist in the hospitals don’t seem to integrate well together between their treatments and medications with constant interactions and adverse side effects. I’m sick of it. ! I want real solutions and to get people out of the hospitals for good!
Already in discussions Sarah - filling this in as a formality
There is a tremendous amount of alternative choices in wellness.   My passion to share the resources I’ve discovered over the last few years continues to grow as I look to expand my business and continue to delve into longevity.
Further education
I wanted to learn something new
Seems like a pretty close step to practicing as an FNP and quicker. The next degree I had planned to pursue
I’m passionate about Health
I’m a hormone health coach and would love to be able to understand labs so I can support my clients better. I have a lady with thyroid issues so your program sounds too good to be true!
"I believe in functional medicine and its approach, to help and heal people suffering in main stream. 

Also would like to know the depth of knowledge that can assist in guiding and eliminating health challenges that are unknowingly ignored in main stream."
I have a child with autism
To add more substance to my Energy Medicine Practice. I'm a Holistic Energy Practitioner, Ordained Metaphysical Minister, Energy Metaphysician, Recovery Metaphysician and Quantum Energy Healing Master Healer and Trainer, Former Medical Healthcare Professional, Hospice Provider, and Quantum Energy Channel.
Going through perimenopause now and lots of my clients are.
I have been an RN for 16 years. I’m disgusted with our sick model healthcare system. I have battled my own autoimmune issues and had to figure out most things on my own and I’m still struggling. I want to heal myself and share my knowledge and experience to help others do the same. I have no plans to retire and I want to find something I love doing to take me into my golden years and I think functional healing and coaching is my calling.
Seen info on Facebook. Very skeptical. Went to Trustpilot, impressed. All I would be out $97. Went to “register….” Not impressed at all. It may be a very good deal but I have  been burned before. At this time, I am just looking to improve my health as I have a nursing position as a Quality Assurance Registered Nurse x 7 months that I really love after working 30 plus years as a RN before starting this position.
I’m currently a nurse but I do not feel that I am able to help most of my patients. I work for a GP & have a med spa.  I have lupus & I know many ppl with other autoimmune diseases. I want to help.
I know my true calling in life is to help and heal people. Unfortunately, I haven’t jumped on it as my career path was changed when I had kids young and dropped out of college. By doing that my journey and passion was but on the back burner so I could support my family immediately. I have always love health and trying to get to the root cause vs applying another bandaid to mask the true issue. I see too many unhappy and unhealthy beings and this world and I just want to be able to make a difference for them and with them
I hold a D.D.S. degree in Mexico but when I immigrated to the USA, I could not practice as a Dentist in California without going back to school. There were no schools near me, so I became a Health Educator/Health Coach and went into Public Health. I've worked in colleges, clinics and hospitals for 25+ years, educating people of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds on disease prevention and health promotion. Health and healing have always been my passion, so as I get older and realize that illnesses and diseases are more rampant than ever (mostly due to the health system being broken, plus the chemicals and hidden sugars in prepackaged foods and sedentarism) my desire is to serve those that have not found solutions in traditional medicine, so they can live healthier and happier lives. I'm also a Certified Life Coach, a T2 Diabetes Counselor, and I hold a diploma in Humanistic Psychology, which have helped me understand human behavior at a deeper level. I believe my combined education can greatly improve the lives of many.
Bottom line is I have always been immersed in the medical Realm in some shape or form and have been working in the Pharma industry for nearly a decade. I’m tired of working for someone. I want to work for myself. In short, I have already been helping coach friends, family, and acquaintances in the health and wellness sector, and I absolutely love and thrive at doing it. I want to make it my life's journey, pursuing it as a career.
Been fascinated with natural medicine. Have a certificate for Dr of nature opathic medicine like to learn all I can to help others out more then I have been
I am a certified nurse midwife that really wants to dive deeper into holistic medicine for my patients. I am working on my certification through the Institute of Functional Medicine but feel like I still want more, which is what intrigued me to purchase this training as well. I am tired of telling people to just eat better and exercise more, it doesn’t work and it’s frustrating for patients and myself to not have better outcomes.
"Hello Sarah,  My interest in the body and its intricate mechanisms began in 2007, when I entered in a comprehensive massage therapy program. The curriculum emphasized the study of disease and dis-ease, and it was there that I discovered my fascination with anatomy, physiology, and the body’s remarkable capacity for healing.

In 2023, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s, which deepened my commitment to understanding the body on a functional level. Through diet and lifestyle changes, I’ve been able to significantly improve my lab results, reinforcing my belief in a root-cause, whole-body approach to wellness. Since then, I have become increasingly drawn to functional medicine, mindfulness, and the integrative practices that help people reclaim health. I find myself continually listening to podcasts, learning from experts, and imagining how I might help others by evolving into a functional medicine practitioner.

This program feels like the perfect next step—a structured way to expand my knowledge while allowing me to move at my own pace, which is essential as a business owner. I’m eager to build on my experience, deepen my understanding, and eventually support others on their healing journeys.  Sarah, are you able to confirm that I will have lifetime access to the full course load I purchased?  Thank you, Karyne"
I’m a registered nurse and I hear from my patients that they need more help than what the doctors are giving them.  They want more one on one care, to really understand what they can do to feel better and how they can do this without more “medicine”.  I also have family who have diabetes, thyroid issues, weight problems and I want to help them and myself for a better life and future! I’m also interested in stepping out of bedside and working for myself without sacrificing income.  This sounds to good to be true but I’m willing to do this, if it only helps me and my family get better health.
there is a 30day guarantee
"Hello, I am about to turn 65 and I started the process  of retirement and red flags started popping up everywhere! BIG RED FLAGS. Printed on the flag it says DON""T STOP NOW!                                                                                            I am the former owner of the Health Connection in Longview WA and became a certified personal trainer in 1990 thru the National Federation of Professional Trainers.                                                                                                  After receiving my certification I trained harder than I ever had and ended up on a Bodybuilding  stage as the 176lb class and overall winner of the Olympia Natural Classic in Olympia WA.   After the win in Olympia people swarmed into my club and I spent the next five years helping others to realize their dreams of becoming something more!                                                                                        It was about that time I met this Woman. She was and still is drop dead gorgeous. I sold my club started a construction company and married a total knock out. 4 children and 10 Grandchildren later here I am!                         The things I believed to be true 40 years ago about fitness  were not wrong  they were just small pieces of a bigger truth that we are coming to realize. These are exciting times! My reason for being here is for my children and their children.  You teach me I teach them and we all become something more!"
To better understand the body
I've worked in the Healthcare industry since 1987. I've worked as a Medical Assistant in several different fields of medicine. Family Practice, internal medicine, asthma and allergy,  rheumatology,  orthopedic surgery. Then went back to school for Massage Therapy. Totally, love what I do, but I know, physically I can't do it forever. So this is my next step.
"I completed a functional nutritionist certification 20 years ago. Since then I've helped hundreds and hundreds of people. The 2020 shutdown hit and my in person practice fell apart. I have not been financially successful transferring to an online business. I have had some great months but not consistent. I know a lot more about online business and now I am ready to uplevel my health expertise. I have been focusing on women in perimenopause the past few months. I have had great success applying my systems to my own perimenopause symptoms. I work very intuitively so I have not relied on ""knowing"" all the protocols. I've had doctors send me their most difficult patients because I would ""do my magic"" and then would just get better. I am on this planet to awaken people to their Divine Healer within. 

I currently work with an amazing functional medicine practitioner for my own health support and I refer my clients to her regularly.  

I also have a 9 year old daughter with a brain injury and rare genetic mutation. I have spent her entire life learning about brain health and what it actually takes to heal the brain. I've been trained by IAHP.org to diagnose brain injury (not as a medical doctor so it's only to be used for my daughter). 

I look forward to learning from you, Sarah! Thank you."
I started having health issues at 32 years old after doing some painting in my first house I bought. The window were open while doing that. A week later,I started having dizzy spells,light headedness,sensitivity to fluorescent lights at home stores. I went to the dr. and he couldn't figure it out,giving me multiple prescriptions to try,that failed. I saw an ad in our local newspaper from a chiropractor who practice naturopathy modalities that was doing a seminar on finding out what is wrong with a person with ailments,naturally. I went to her for many years and she did some good things that helped,but still not to cure my illness. I became multiple chemical sensitive to everything with fragrances,gasoline,exhaust fumes,camp fires etc. I still have these symptoms and no one has been able to figure it out. Throughout the years since 2000,I became really intrigued to naturopathy and homeopathy alternative medicine and supplementation. From that point on,I had dreamed about becoming certified but didn't as prices were so high,that I could never afford it. So after caring for my elderly parents starting in 2012 and watching them deteriorate while the doctors give them all these toxic medications and misdiagnose,I knew someday I would turn to finding an opportunity like this. The final motivation was caring for my 88 year old mom at my home and having her live with me was a very life learning experience till she passed away this year on February 1st,2025. It was a super peaceful passing that I was so lucky to experience,just as my Dad's passing in September,2018 was also wonderful. Both did not show signs of pain or suffering. With my mom,I chose to not have any morphine paing meds of any kind and prayed that she would not need them and she didn't! The hospice team could not believe it,neither could I. It has been a trying time since her passing and I miss her dearly. I am healing little by little. I now know that I need purpose in my life to help educate others which I have been doing on a small level with friends and family. I always thought if I would of done this years ago and learned about functional medicine of how I could of helped both my mom and dad amongst many others. I have been out of work since my mom passed as I was her PCA and completed every single task for her to the end. So I know I have some knowledge,empathy more than anything to want to learn and get certified to help so many others along with my own health struggles that people don't teach or know. I have spent so much money over 25 years seeing many different practicioners which changed my life journey,but not to my expectations. With that being said,it is now my time to be the healer,life helper and make the money that I deserve!
Expanding our practice
"I am very impressed by the Foundation course ""Integrative Health Functional Practitioner"" I am doing right now. I want to continue this path."
I am a nurse and I’ve been looking for a way to continue to help people but on my own terms.
I’ve been sick for about 10 years. Seen too many doctors. I would love to be able to figure out what’s wrong with me when they can’t. Plus, I would love to learn more about Functional medicine and hopefully help others like me. My husband and I are considering buying a clinic and thought I could market these services as well.
"I have dabbled with energy healing for 10 years. I trained in 2014. I was seeing clients but not consistently and I always felt I didn’t really get to their root causes. 

I have healed myself from depression with energy techniques. 

3 years ago I woke up and couldn’t move from my neck down. Over the next 18 months the pain was excruciating and I lost so much weight. I was eventually diagnosed with PMR. I was put on steroids. They stopped the pain but I blotted out. My bloods always came back “ok”.  I’m always tired, in pain and have zero motivation and the weight is upsetting me. I hardly eat because I’ve lost my appetite. 

I studied German New Medicine so I believe the body knows exactly what it’s doing. But I don’t have the confidence to get to the root quickly and help people out of pain quickly. 

I love learning about the body and why it does what it does. I believe this will give me more credibility and I also wanted to train to cure myself. I’m not spending another year like this. 

I’m trained in EFT, NLP, colour psychology, reiki, MetaHealth (GNM). I think they will enhance my approach. 

I love presenting and writing so I can see this is where I’ll expand. Also, doing research on supplements I’m shocked at all the crap out there! People deserve better. 

The only thing I’m concerned about is that your course is all US centric and I’m based in the UK. Do you have additional information for the legal requirements of UK people.? 

I’ve been useless at promoting what I do as it always comes across woo woo. With this I can see I’ll get more focused. I have several friends who are always tired and lack motivation. Maybe this is the route I am being guided down?"
Working for toxic bosses in private offices that are doing illegal and unethical things. I now no longer want to not work for others. I want to follow my passion of functional medicine. My last day at my job is December 4, 2025 and then I will be unemployed.
I spent 12k at a functional medicine academy (ugh) so that I could better understand bloodwork and marketing. Neither  happened and it was infuriating - I really hope things are as simple here I am an ND already
I want to open a IV hydration clinic
I’ve been a Nurse for 41 years. I am currently a Telemetry /Med Surg / PCU/Rapid Assess Nurse….. I’ve found that patient Education along with the “what’s and why’s and what if’s” have been severely lacking…. We are practicing “Sickcare, not Healthcare”….. But I’m an old dog….. and my Patients appreciate me helping them to understand what’s happening and why …. and what to do to feel better …..I have 2 children in their mid 20’s and they are VERY interested in ROOT causes …..I’m excited for this new venture
I want to learn more about holistic health and be able to help my clients better. I want to teach people how to use God given nutrition and herbs to help their bodies do what it is naturally designed to do.
I already answers these questions once - do I have to do this every time I log in?
Hi Sarah, I've had the opportunity to chat with via e mail, which has been great.  I will reiterate what I already shared with you.  I am a burnt out R.N. that would like to do try something else that will bring me cash flow and independence.  I would like to help people in a different way.  I live in Australia and I have not heard of this type of work here.  Not surprised as Australia is far behind with lots of things.  So yah, I want mental freedom, financial freedom and to to help people in a different way.  I just hope this can happen in Australia.
I simply love learning and want to be in the know. I love people and dont want to let anyone down or miss a thing so I educate myself.
I have a home care agency and also numerous autoimmune disorders. This just seems like a great idea for me.
Looking for options to better serve my patients and draw more patients to my practice.
Hi i am 62, retired from teaching and want to retrain something that I feel is equally valuable as teaching. As i get older i appreciate health issues creeping up and difficult to see a docyor to get early intervention.  My expection of this training is that i will be able to bridge the gap between suffering and the time it takes to get to see the specialist for none urgent medical isdues and at the same time give me a paid vocation.
Currently working as RN with Nutrition degree as well. Interested in alternative healing v/s traditional methods.
I am a NP, want to make a difference in my patients lives by understanding in detail what make them sick.
Educational Learning
I have been out of nursing for a few years due to not believing in the current mainstream medical culture. I have been self teaching natural remedies for a couple of years of years now and feel it’s time to make it official!
The president said i was not a professional after 40 years and 3 degrees
Looking for work I can do from home , helping others . My 25 yr corporate career in insurance has become unreliable.
So I can understand and help heal health issues I'm dealing with and then take that knowledge to help others.
I've been in the medical field for 31 years as a MSN. Due to an accident that left me with an incomplete spinal cord injury,  changed my life.  I just want to learn more clinical knowledge.
I'm a massage therapist who wants to diversify my practice and create an additional income stream. I'd like to be able to scale back on so much of the physicality in my daily work.
Both of my parents died, my mother in a car accident, and my father last year from heart and kidney failure. My sister has autoimmune issues. We have a great deal of traumatic events in our family. Iv3 been a nurse for 20 years in ICU and flight nursing, and I couldnt participate in the western medical corporate Healthcare anymore. I jumped ship and opened my wellness business with the desire to help people heal, truly heal, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually, and live life in abundance, like we were meant to. This certification opportunity gives me the option of exploring so many avenues, which is great cause I want to be good at helping in a holistic manner.
This is much much too long to share here.  I will say I spent five years learning to be a health coach, but never felt qualified to actually help people.  I walked away for the last year.  Last night I told a friend how much I still felt called to helping people who want to heal.  This morning another friend casually shared a link for your program.  She has no idea what I said last night.   I feel called and I’m ready to be of service.   😭
"Hi there, my name is Jamie and your description described me perfectly. “Burnt out nurse, mother, someone who knows and feel a greater purpose”.

20 years ago, I was diagnosed with psoriasis. I was only 18 years old with a nurse mom who respectfully relied heavily on Western Medicine. I followed their guidance, did their tests, took their medicine. Although I was able to “clear” the psoriasis, I knew I wasn’t healing myself. That is what led me to dive into holistic approaches. 

Fast forward to now, a mother of 2, a nurse with cardiac background currently working in GI, and still someone who feels a deep sacred and spiritual calling to heal. 

I have prayed for signs.

I believe this is my answered peayer."
I have been praying for a way to serve others in a productive and meaningful way. I have overcome health issues naturally and by educating myself online informally. I have recovered from gallbladder issues Lyme disease and digestive bloating and discomfort. I want to formalize and structure this interest to be able to help others.
"This certification feels like the next step in a very long and difficult healing journey. I’ve spent years suffering with Lyme disease, going from doctor to doctor with no answers, and it took far too long to finally be diagnosed. Even after that, I had to go through multiple Lyme practitioners before finding the right one who could truly help me.

Most of my healing has come from trusting my own intuition, muscle testing, and researching what my body actually needs. I’ve had to navigate mold, SIBO, and so many complications on my own because standard medical care failed me again and again. I’ve learned to dose my own supplements and medications more accurately than my doctors could because my body doesn’t fit into the “standard protocol” box.

I know how terrifying it is to be sick and unsupported, and I know how life-changing it feels when someone finally understands the root causes and gives real guidance.

Through all this suffering, something inside me keeps saying that none of this was for nothing—that my experience is meant to help others. I want to turn my pain into purpose. I know how lost and unsupported chronic illness can feel, and I want to guide others through the confusion with real understanding and compassion. I want to help people who are lost, overwhelmed, and dealing with chronic illness, and give them the clarity, validation, and direction I never had.

This certification feels aligned, meaningful, and deeply important."
Been an RN for 25 years, worked in many fields, now in hospice. But I want something o can do from home and in retirement (I’m 61 so it’s coming up fast). And this sounds fun. I love analysis and have a habit of always looking for cause and seeking solutions (in hospice I’m known to fight for my patients).
Hi. First I want to say that I saw this offer and was quite skeptical because what on the internet is not these days. The price for what the claims are does not seem appropriate. I love the idea of functional nutrition and Medicine. I am a holistic nutrition consultant. I want to work with clients in a way to help them get to the root cause of their health challenges. Reading the description of this program I feel that this can give me the tools that I need to help my clients get there.
I’m interested in natural healing!  I have had several physical challenges through the years where Allopathic Medicine failed me but found improvements through alternative healing practices.
Want to learn about functional medicine
I am a retired pediatric nurse of 50 years. I am interested in healing and I’m interested in learning more about healing and helping people. I do not want to start a business, I do not need to make more money, I just want to learn more and see where that takes me.
I would like to be able to help myself and others with their health care issues.
i've been a practicing life coach for over 6 years- excited to bring more health in for a more holistic approach
Former Nurse working in advanced nutraceuticals
I’m a Med-Surg nurse who is getting older and burnt out.
Hello. What made me invest today is because I’ve always had a calling in helping people. Right now I’m a Certified Medical Assistant but I moved to the non clinical side where I’m a Health Navigator for Medicaid patients. I help them find a he resources they need to make their lives easier. I help them understand their insurance and get the support they need. I already see the struggle in healthcare with patients not understanding things or getting confused. Also, I feel this would be a great opportunity for me to be financially stable for me and my family. This is amazing. I love it and I love to learn!
I'm a nurse, 2 years in. I worked at a hospital that treated the current problem, never wanted to dig into the root of the cause even when I took the time to dive into their charts. I always felt disheartened knowing we'd be discharging them home to be right back from the root cause. Unfortunately this happened to my Nana. She came to my hospital, I reviewed her results begged them to be preventative when her results showed pulmonary hypertension and we ended up right back in the hospital 2 weeks later. She was lucky to make it back, but I know some people aren't. And that frustrated me immensely, especially since its my family they chose to send home not fully treated. I hate hospitals because many are money focused, the patients in our beds are dollar signs and us nurses are burnt out keeping up with corporate demands to make them more money. There's no heart behind corporate and it leads to tired, fatigued, angry, bitter nurses who do our best. I want to run a practice, do retreats for nurses in hospitals, and more. I also struggle with my own health ailments, and my mom recently is struggling with health ailments that are ruining her quality of life and the Dr's are just playing a guessing game. Im hoping to increase my knowledge to help the ones I love.
I have just finished my nursing diploma after 10yrs in disability and aged care but nothing has really intersted me like this.
Medicine has always been my thing. I started in nursing homes at 15, started college for it late, but then life happened. I’ve done courses for holistic nutrition, herbalism and more. I believe that our bodies are capable of way more than just processing prescriptions as a savior. My husband helps people through massage and I’d like to bring more to that practice and to the clients we see so that they can feel better at every level.
I’m looking at a career change and making a difference in the type of work I do.
Retired RN and my daughter is recovering from being in a coma for two months. I need a deeper understanding of how the body processes foods and how to recover muscles and brain from deficiencies of diet.
Hi Sarah! I first saw an ad for the Functional Medicine Coach Professional Certificate and Hormone Balance Certificate and decided to give it a try. I am in a full blown menopause and not enjoying anything anymore. I have every single symptom they listed and I’m in a process of getting an HRT. However, because of a suspicious mammogram result, they want to do a biopsy on a lump before they approve hormones. It will be at least another 2 months before I can start the therapy. So that course was for me. However, I always felt my calling was a psychotherapy, but I never finished school for it and now at 51 I feel like that is not something I can do. I’ve been searching for other ways I could have a similar practice, develop a specialty and hopefully build a successful practice with it. I’ve been practicing self-hypnosis for 35 yrs and I looked into getting a hypnotherapy certificate, but found out that in Florida, that school’s certificate would not allow me to practice professionally, because in FL to practice any type of therapy with the clients, you have to have a Masters degree in psychotherapy. The school itself did a research and informed me that I would not be able to make it a business in FL. So, I am looking to learn a bunch of new methods and practices on improving my own health and hopefully learn enough to be able to develop a successful business.
I am a nurse practitioner for the past 10 years. I have been in the federal prison system for the past 9 years. I have felt stifled and disheartened. I took the leap during this shutdown to break free. I have a huge desire to help the whole person live their best life. I also desperately want to help my daughter. She has been passing out for the past two years every time she is stressed out mentally and physically. Every doctor has told her she is fine, but as a mama, she doesn't feel fine. I know she's not alone. It's so frustrating to feel like she's being ignored. I personally feel this will help me help her and countless others like her. I am fed up with sick medicine and want to focus on true well care!
Burnt out on nursing and looking for insite just for myself right now.  Have not worked in 3 years.  Would love the rest of your courses but $300 is too much right now
I'm a chiropractor currently on military deployment. Thought I can self improve on down time
I’m an RN with a certification as holistic practitioner, sound healing, Intuitive Healing and Reiki.  Since moving back to Florida from Asheville NC I have been not practicing alternative healing modalities except for being a hospice nurse in homecare. I feel it is time to finish my own healing journey and start working on others next year!  I am semi retired and love to travel.
I've been working with women on fitness for 35+ years and have overcome a few major health challenges and trauma work. I was attracted to your offering and felt it could enhance what I am doing with women today and add to what I am sharing.
"I grew up a healthy girl. But about 13 years ago, I developed an autoimmune condition of scarring alopecia. Nobody in my family has such a thing and I knew this was lifestyle related. I had injured my tailbone about a decade before that. It had gotten so bad that it did not let me sleep at night because there was no position that was comfortable. I spent the entire decade before developing alopecia dreading nights because no position was comfortable to sleep in. That was a long and miserable life. It continued for another decade. I am much better right now and do get to sleep at night.
I know that my lifestyle was not in alignment. I did not have the ability to seek help for my tailbone in time and I did not know that it would have such long-term consequences. This sparked my interest in Functional Medicine that takes care of the entire person as a whole unit, including their sleep, nutrition exercise, and whatever hormonally is going on inside the body. I have been to Functional Medicine doctors myself.
My two kids have developed alopecia areata - one after Covid and one after some vaccines at the pediatric office. This again is very, very sad for me.
My husband is a physician and he believes in diet and exercise, but he does not know much about Functional Medicine. Usually, I do not have a voice in these things because of his degree. I would like to learn more and have a voice in the house too on medical related things."
I am currently an operations administrator for a very busy, well established primary care clinic. I help out with the clinic in many ways, I decided as a functional medicine couch, I can do more. Additionally, I personally have 4 auto immune diseases that I would like to learn to handle more efficiently instead of hearing doctors tell me they don’t know what to do….
I'm interested in helping people with health concerns that doctors can't seem to diagnose.
I was a nurse practitioner, left my career to take care of my kids. I am don’t have my NP license anymore and I have the need to continue to practice what I love. Especially with functional medicine which is the future of medicine in my opinion.
"I’ve been a nurse for 55 yrs.-30 yrs.in hospital & critical care,20 in occupational health & most recently school nursing. Never really took off with my coaching practice- I guess I benefits the structure of a job! I also need $-social security check is helpful, I can slow down & create my own schedule.
I’m hoping to learn more about getting to the root cause of someone’s complaint… I’m a board certified holistic nurse with 2 other health coaching certifications (one in integrative Nutrition)
 I want to study functional medicine."
I'm a NLP Transformational and Wellness Coach. I want to solidify my Credentials and offer Functional Medicine Health Coaching as well
To add to the coaching work I do in order to add more value for my clients.
"I am a Registered Nurse of 35 years, I want to semi retire; just to work  2-3 days a week. But it is still very stressful. I am a nurse case manager, doing discharge planning. It is draining."
I want more clinical background to start my membership community
Certified in i tegrwtive medicine.  Looking for coaching certification.
I already work as a health coach and provide wellness services with various devices. I want to expand my abilities and increase confidence with my clients.
I’ve always wanted to do coaching and the more I see the nursing world fall apart and the healthcare systems in shambles. I really wanted to one get my training hours and two invest in the future I love what I do as a nurse however, I see things going south very fast and I love my business with Arbonne, but and goal is what I’m setting up for and I want to use Arbonne as a vehicle in order to create my dream which is to have a Homestead/retreat, nature retreat where I can help people reconnect with nature and yeah, I hope to hopefully do a herbology course at some point as well and maybe some workshops who knows
"I invested here because I have a strong desire to fill in a few missing gaps in my practice. I want to coach women 50 and over from a holistic perspective, yoga philosophy, health coach, and RN (which I am) to improved health. The goal is teach, coach and create courses from this mindset.  People struggle with the finding root cause(s) to their problems and often times the western medical model does offer practical, simple solutions because they are not asking the right questions. 
What happened in my life that lead me to this moment? I have been repeatedly asking the questions in terms of myself and everyone else: ""Have you experienced a significant loss? In what ways has that loss and grief shaped and influenced your life? How do you think your life would be different if you had not had that experience? What choices have you made as a result of that loss? Has it affected your health in ways you are aware of? If you wanted your life and health to be different than it currently is, what would you change? What would you like to look like?"" This is the short answer."
I answered this already
I have been a RN for 32 yrs. Past 10 years I have work as a hospice nurse and I am burnt out. I enjoy my helping families get through tough times and helping patients to complete there life cycle with respect and dignity. I am ready to start helping others by trying to get down to the main cause of ill being and not just mask the problem.
I sent you an e mail earlier this evening. Please read it as it gives you some info about me. Thanks
I'm a CPA by profession. I would like to help the community, the people around me with free service. I have no intention to make money off this learning. I have a job as a CPA which pays the bills. I have been helping coaching people for the past 6 years and I keep spending money on learning naturopathy and Ayurveda treatments. I'll wait for your holiday specials to get access to all the courses and lifetime access. Thank you for the generous offer.
"First of all your ad just popped up on Instagram. What caught my attention was about getting certified to be a coach in Integrative Medicine. I am an Aesthetic RN at a Dermatology/Aesthetic/ Integrative Medicine practice. I have been treating patients for 14 years with fillers,  Botox, lasers, etc. ,but I am very holistic minded and not feeling great about the injectable anymore !! I am all about preventative medicine, supplements, and working out to build muscle, bone density and strength.  I am a 2x cancer survivor (cervical and breast) with surgeries  only...no chemo or radiation 🙌🙏
This new career path really excites me as I love to help my patients now by sharing what has helped me with supplements, food choices etc. So I  can only imagine where all this wealth of information will take me with my caring,  serving heart ❤️"
"I struggled with nerve pain for 6 years, started before I hit 30. I have seen at least 20 different doctors, and had multiple spinal injections. I was told that my nerve pain is caused by inflammation but no one seems to be interested in figuring out why my nerves are inflamed. They stated it was caused by narrowing space between L4-L5, L5-S1. But my image honestly did not look that bad. I keep taking pain killers, sugary food. At the worse, I can only work 5 hours a day and then needs to stay in bed for the rest of day. I put on weight, lost my ability to dance, eventually I started having insomnia before my period. And that is when a very knowledgeable pelvic floor specialist that I have been working with suggested me to see a functional medicine doctor. I did not like the doctor’s sales strategy, and found a coach instead. After getting my food sensitivity test result, my nerve pain disappeared within 2 months. I am on the fourth month of my gut healing journey. And know I can dance and weight lift again. My TSH is still high at 6.75. And it probably will take a while for my body to be ready for pregnancy. I forgot to mention know I understand why I keep miscarrying.
Luckily at the moment,  i can mostly function during the day without too much brain fog. (I feel like I have a brain again!!) I’m a licensed psychotherapist. So I am sensitive to mood changes. I stopped having mood swings around my period. And I realized lots of my patients can also benefit from functional medicine. (although I like to call them my clients, but I want to distinguish my clients from my therapy business and coaching business. ) I want to learn this for my self, my family, and my future coaching clients. I have been doing readings on functional medicine but it really was not enough. So I need to learn in a more systematic way. And I love systems and ways to organize stuff as well as knowledge. 
I just registered a coaching business, because I know it is good to learn while working under supervision,  the same way I got trained as a psychotherapist. I am very excited to start this journey. 
Btw, I am from China. And functional medicine basically does not exist there. So I also want to be able to bring it to people in China someday."
Im a registered nurse. I have been wanting to get away from the over thinking of new residents and the nonsense testing for something that is much less complicated. To utilize my skill and knowledge base to help others without doctors getting the credit for my work. To work for myself, be able to create ny own schedule and have time for my family.
I would like to go into depth with Wellness Coaching and know that functional medicine is the approach I believe in.
I’m an RN with 30 yrs experience.  I was laid off from my job 3.5 yrs ago & im also a single mom with 3 kids. Those 2 yrs of being laid off before finding my job now, depleted me financially & I’m now trying to get back on my feet making less than $40k a year.  I’m tired of the sick care model in our modern day healthcare system.  I’m tired of making half of what I used to make as a nurse with 30 yrs experience. I want to do something I can feel good about that will also lead me to financial freedom working part time.  Heath & wellness is something I feel passionate about & over last couple months tried to figure out a way to work in this kind of area.
Personal healing & To heal others Mentally Physically Spiritually Financially
I want to work on holistic medicine
I've always wanted to pursue FM but didn't think I could afford it.
"This past year we I began a new journey career journey as a health coach!
 It has been the best decision and has been such a rewarding experience. 
 I am looking to expand my horizons and continue my personal growth in health coaching and certifications."
I am a nurse just wanted to help people and improve my education
I am a certified health coach. I transformed my health and this certification would give me more credibility.
Stopped trusting the system. I love learning. New career. Health Advocate/Coach.
"I am choosing to invest in a functional medicine course for two important reasons. First, I want to better understand my own health. Lately, I’ve been struggling with fatigue and I want to learn the underlying causes so I can take care of myself more effectively. Having this knowledge will empower me to make healthier choices and improve my quality of life.  
Second, I see this course as an opportunity to create additional income. Since my recent separation, I’ve been working overtime at a blood banking job, but despite the long hours, the pay is not enough to cover my needs. I often come home exhausted, and I know I need a path that can provide both financial stability and personal fulfillment. Functional medicine offers me a chance to build a new skill set that can support me professionally while also helping others.  
This course is not just an educational step, it’s an investment in my health, my future, and my independence."
Always been into personal health & nutrition and now more than ever want to help people who are clueless & don't see what's going on with Corp Food & Big Pharma
"I am looking to have a better quality of life and be able to provide more financial security to myself and my son. 
I also fascinates me to help people to make better choices in their lives and I will start this journey helping myself first, since right now I am an overweight mom with a feeling that I am stuck o. Many areas of my life."
To help my husband figure out his health issues.
I have been in 10 or more surgeries myself & 10 more for family & friends and personally witness & analyze each medicine literature, each treatment , tests & procedures, each medical impressions/ diagnosis & at end, I say to myself there should have been a better way/approach to these sicknesses & diseases as I have researched later.
Frustrated with the medical profession that cannot find answers to my irregular blood tests and symptoms.  I have many healing practitioner certifications and still cannot get to the root case of my problems.  There are many others that are in the same boat as I am and I would like to be able to help them as well.
Want to try something new
Im in the process of  furthering. / upgrading my-profession for more income / investment (so i can buy my own retirement  house )in preparation for retirement .
I've been working on my own health issues for years. I've made quite a bit of progress, but I'm not  100%. I want to be completely well and help others get there too.
"Working in healthcare since my early 20's, I've always wanted to help people. I was introduced to wellness and supplements in my 20's with plant based nutraceuticals. My health over the years has been good and bad, my weight vacillating up and down with having children, going through divorce, stress, etc. I became a Certified Nurse Midwife/Nurse Practitioner in 2009 and found so many women suffering and complaining about fatigue, brain fog, stomach issues, weight gain, depression... I am a part of a wellness supplement company that focuses on use of adaptogens and detox support and went through a 30 day detox a few years ago and felt so much better. I have listened to podcasts and love learning how giving your body what it needs, it can be a miracle healing itself. 
I have been working so hard in a very busy practice and don't get much sleep throughout the week and feel I can't live my life and take time for my family like I need to. I already do a lot of teaching and recommendations to patients in the clinic I work in, however it is an employer situation and I do not have the freedom to say as much as I would like or recommend the supplements these people need. I am about to be 60 and need to convert my income from being employed to owning my own business that I can work from anywhere, help more people, and be able to still pay my bills. 
I need to help myself through this, and want to truly impact others by getting them on the right tract and prevent chronic disease in their lives. 
My plans are to obtain the knowledge and certification here, incorporate this into my wellness company with Quantum scan analysis. I am also working on 3-D OB Ultrasound training, and plan to open a boutique practice performing 3-D OB Ultrasounds as well, however that will take money that I do not have at this time. Building my wellness company will help fund the other. I feel that once I open the boutique, I can have a place for in person visits or online, but separate from my home. Both of these are my desire...being able to see my pregnant moms in a fun, happy experience, and helping both men and women get their health back. This is the way I would like to go out :)"
"Sarah, 
Where do i start.. I have already shared with you some things about me but that just skimmed the surface. LOL
in addition to what i shared initially… I also am a c diff survivor, (not from taking antibiotics, and since i rarely leave my home.. not sure where i contacted it, but also i have a history of chronic gut infections, so who knows.) Always on guard for the next pathogen. Hence one of the reasons why i monitor my gut via Vibrant America labs a few times a year. Their “gut zoomer” test is approx 20+ page report, which gets a bit overwhelming to interpret, but thankfully i have Dr. Betty to assist in reviewing the results. I understand most of it by now though, without much of her help. Been doing them for 10 years. One of several markers i have been working on is butyrate. Finally got my deficient butyrate levels into range last year. It took several years of commitment to fix it, but i kept chiseling away at it and finally succeeded. Just when i was about to throw up the white towel.. my levels reached in range. But still trying to resolve the inflammation and lowered immune markers, that the jabs caused. Persistence is key.  
5 years ago, i made the biggest mistake of my life  and let “fake news” fear mongers scare  me into getting 2 moderna covid shots. It nearly took my life. I am lucky to be alive. Hence why i am still pretty much homebound and still trying to survive and recover every day. It has been the most difficult 5 years of my life. Very isolating situation. But which made me step up my game on my research in attempt to help my body heal.   thank God i like to research. LOL.🤓I have learned a tremendous amount and discovered that i am stronger than i think, and given the right tools, our bodies are designed to heal.. Thanks to Our almighty God. The shots did, neurological damage, vascular damage, gut damage, and immune damage, for starters. The remorse i live with every day is a heavy weight to bare. But with the grace of God, i am still here and still hoping for more healing. It also affected my brain, and made my “managable add”, a lot worse. I have good days and bad days with all the above, so some days i have to take mental and physical breaks. So, i am glad to know that there is no timeline to finish the 3 courses i purchased. 🤓
All that said.. This too, is my motivation to help others like myself who have been injured. And believe me.. there are more folks who were damaged than anyone is talking about. My only sister got lymphoma after her 5th booster. Thankfully she caught it pretty early via annual mammogram, and it is in remission currently, but like so many.. she has not connected the dots to the covid shots. No matter how much i preach about it. My 89 year old Mother, is dying, and currently in the hospital after collapsing last week again. (Not surprised since she opted for her 8th booster less than a month ago). She had a stroke in March from taking the shots, and although she was rallying like a champion.. i knew if she opted for another booster, it would be the nail in her coffin. So sad. She was a walker most of her adult life.. walked 2 miles a day until her the stroke. Then had a second stroke a few months ago. Then got another covid booster and now she can’t walk at all. I share this story, to explain how frustrating it is to KNOW what is causing all this damage in people,(that are brainwashed by big pharma docs), and not be “heard” when i shout it from the roof tops to run the other way from the “genocide jabs”. My Mother  for example is influenced heavily by her husband (who faithfully gets his flu and covid shots every year ), and influenced by her standard of care Dr’s.
Heck.. even though the jabs nearly killed me (her own daughter)..she still chooses to inject the poison anyway. Here we are again at the “no respect” topic. If only i would have persued getting my medical degree, with an MD on my name.. then she MIGHT have listened to my advise. And sadly i doubt she will be alive when i finally get certified health coach status. But even that.. so many people are in denial about the covid shots, that what i say, goes in one ear and out the other.🧐
On a more positive note.lol…I look forward to helping others recover and others live a healthier, happier life. And i hope my story will help others in their healing journey. Most Dr’s just gas light folks like me, more so with the jab injuries, but even before that, because of the complicated nature of my case, with genetic snips etc etc.. So i want to educate and empower others to be their own  health advocate, and to have the confidence to do so. I often reflect on the pain and suffering i have endured for the past 5 years, and i can’t help but think, there is a reason i was spared. I strongly feel that it is my responsibly educate others with the knowledge i can share, for anything pertaining longevity and vitality. This nightmare i have lived thru has strengthened me in ways i never knew possible. Even with ongoing health challenges  .. i refuse to quit. If i quit.. they win. 
Talking about longevity.. i am a big fan high quality supplements, to include the use of stacking peptides . I trust Integrative Peptides brand, for oral, sublingual, application.
Peptides are amazing. But i need more knowledge on them. It is challenging to gather science backed data on them. Glad to see they are starting to be talked about a little more recently, but wishing i had a reliable source to educate me on peptides more indepth. I know there are a few Dr’s out there using them, few and far between still. Also.. i do testing annually, and recommend it to others, for heavy meta; panels, and what i call “stealth virus panel”. Especially in more complicated cases, such as mine. Lyme testing etc.. The problem with getting others to get their Dr to order these test, is that most Dr’s don’t have clue how to “manage” these complicated topics. I am blessed to of had a very knowledgable functional medicine doc for 14 years. He taught me a lot, to include lots of blood work at least twice a year. I keep track of my “stealth viruses”, and take Valgancyclovir to suppress them.  Yes.. on occasion.. big pharma has it’s place. It truly is a great feeling to have the  knowledge and tools to address complex health issues, that most Dr’s are not familiar with. Funny story.. I often am sharing info with my current function med doc (semi retired), it is fun to teach my Dr. LOl🤓 He is a super nice person, and always receptive to my input. I dread when he retires because i will never find another Dr. that trust me enough to let me fill out my own lab req’s. 😳. Love it! But he knows i will order way more test than he ever would, so we cover everything he usually runs and a lot more. LOL. Have to schedule extra time with him to review my results, because  i 
order so many. 🤓
Anyway.. enough for now.. your head is probably spinning , so don’t want to overwhelm. But you seem perfectly capable of handling so much info. Hoping i can focus long enough to finish the 3 courses, and get my certs. Question: are there any future “hidden cost” that i should be aware of moving forward. Don’t like surprises. LOL I ask, with all due respect, because of how you have your check out set up, with add on this and that. Just needing transparency thru this certification process. 
i believe i have filled out everything that you need to proceed with level 1 course. I will likely need you to “hold my hand” thru this process. Do you strictly communicate via e mails? 
I would guess the answer is yes, since you have so many clients to assist. Looking forward to this next chapter in my life journey, and glad to have you by my side coaching me along the way. Please be patient with me. i have no timeline to finish. And hoping i can pass the exams etc. TBD
Kindest Regards"
"I can help my people better 
Help them get of their type 2 medications"
Want to change how people access Healthcare and truly treat them
I am a newly semi-retired cardiovascular register nurse of 23+ years.
Dear Sarah, thank you for showing up with your timely FM program. I have searched and searched for years to find a good FM program that would not only train me and Certify me to become an effective, research-based and solution-oriented Coach. But a FM Coach with authority known to transform lives and heal people. A FM program that would also give me a real financial satisfaction great enough to free me totally from my current, unreliable low-income ticket clients together with my low-pay current substitute teaching job. This is it Sarah! I am in!
Two reasons: to learn how I can feel better, why I have such low energy in spite of “normal” lab values. Then use what I learn to help others who are having the same problems. Post-menopause aggravation!
I wanted this course to help me and my family but I also want something I can do from home, not work for some one else.
I have been circling back to this for quite awhile now and I feel that it's the right time
I have been a Certified Nurse's Assistant for 29 years, a Certified Medication Assistant for 22 years, a Pharmacy technician for 18 years. I'm also a Cosmetologist for 8 years. I love working with and helping people. I've also had my own health challenges. I have high blood pressure, a hiatus hernia, and acid reflux. I had a heart attack February 2025. I have PTSD from a domestic violence situation in 2023. I want to learn as much as I can to help myself and others.  I'm not going to get a promotion on my job, so I definitely want to open my own practice next year. It will be so rewarding to be able to help others and get paid good money for it. When you love what you do, it doesn't feel like work, it's freedom and joy. I will be so excited to go to work everyday knowing I'm helping to change someone's life for the better!
The methodology promised and the business support
I have a background and healthcare.  I gave up my RN license.  Healthcare had changed, being a nurse was no longer feeding my soul the way it used to.  I opened a small metaphysical shop with an extensive apothecary and started to learn and grow my herbal business.  After about a year and a half I decided I wanted to learn more and do more and be more so here I am.
I have health coaching qualification but want more in depth knowledge to launch my health coaching business next year
brush up on clinical skills
I am a certified personal trainer and I work with mostly with 50 and older clients helping them strength training and longevity. I also help them with nutrition but what to be able to help them and taking this course will allow me to do so. Health and wellness and strength trading is the key to longevity and being healthy.
4 years ago a friend of mine I was working with at the time just couldn’t take the job any more. It was sucking the life out of her. We got together and formed an idea to open up a functional clinic. Upon looking at all of the information, I just couldn’t take the risk and I had no money to buy the certification to be a health coach. My friend is an APRN and she had the knowledge, the faith and the resources to build her practice. I was her first client and she is now my primary care physician. I have Hashimoto thyroiditis and I have figured out that doctors are stupid and they don’t listen. I have tried to change diets, do food sensitivity tests and all of it and with the help of my friend, I am finally feeling better. BUT…I’m not where I want to be. I am also type II diabetic and there is just so much. I have helped many many friends with complications, but I want to learn and know more. So this is a huge blessing for me. I literally bought everything and it is still less than the lowest price program I have seen. I’m excited to jump in with both feet in January!
Nutrition and hormones
"I earned my BS in health and wellness about 10 years ago.  I tried to get into the industry but just couldn't make it happen. Fast fwd 10 years and I'm tired of the corporate stuff and ready to brach out on my own, be my own boss. I love the industry and would really like to be part of it. I want to be someone people can put their trust into bc I've had a lot of doctors over the years not seem to care (but maybe their burnt out) or help me or push my ""feelings"" aside -- I think maybe it's called gaslight me. I want to also learn this info for myself to help me get healthier. I struggle immensely with mental health over the last decade and am finally feeling better to take on a task like this and make it flourish into what I need and want it to be. I also plan to get a nutrition certification to assist in my work and offer more help bc the nutrition industry can be consuming. I want to work mostly with women who are in perimenopause and menopause because we should really have more practitioners in that area. Pretty much ready to quit this job but I have no interest in looking for a new job and feel if I can do something on my own, I'll be happier."
outside, of this course i studied natural medicine,i started just small courses, like  Detoxfication,i love rife]so i bought a U.S.A. Rife machine,with M.O.P.A  copy of Rife original.so far i cured 3 people of stage 4,i like red light therapy also, Herbs like hawthorn berries, for heart,so on.
I’m a Registered Holistic Nutritionist but have had a wellness business selling medical devices globally for 10 years. I’m wanting to get back into some client work but do not want to make $75/hour. I do not want to work 40 hours either.  My husband and snd I are building another online business and I’d like to be able to add monthly income through highly valuable client sessions. This won’t be my whole business but I’m hoping this will add something really wonderful to our business.
Referral
I chose this certification because I feel like I have a calling to be a healer. I already have certifications in Crystal Healing, Spiritual Life Coaching, and Holistic Wellness. I suffer from a few conditions myself, and I knew that this certification would help me better understand my own health and help others at the same time.
In the last two years I have been dx with mild cognitive impairment and a host of GI issues. At 67 I realize that after 30+ years on a host of prescription drugs, I am no better than when I started, in fact Im worse. Recently, I have researched and begun natural self healing with Borax, Hydrogen Peroxide, Supplements and Essential Oils Therapy but don't really understand it with the depth I want. This program seems crazy to begin at my age but I feel that truly knowledgeable people are scarce in my community and I need to know, to help myself and perhaps others.
"I have lived with many / varying degrees of chronic pain and illness since birth. While for most of my life I just accepted it as part of my life, I also always felt deep inside a feeling of ""there has to be more than this!"", ""we weren't meant to live on constant pain and suffering"". I tried looking for answers and relief in the world of western medicine, only to be pay out thousands of dollars to be told over and over again that ""they didn't know what was causing xyz"", or my favorite was ""you'll just have to live with it"". Every visit to a supposed medical professional/expert, left me with zero answers, less and less trust in Doctors/our sick-care system, and with a deeper burning desire/need to find my own answers + heal myself. 
The last decade has been a journey of doing just that. I have healed decades worth of chronic shoulder pain, IBS / Severe gastrointestinal issues, hormone imbalances + cycle irregularities, among other things in my body - mostly through intuitive body awareness, deep emotional + energetic healing, holistic practices and lifestyle shifts of course. TRUE heath & wellness have become my passion and I feel it's my mission to help as many people as I can heal their own bodies, and experience true and lasting wellness and vitality!

I have a health coaching certification already (since about 5 years ago) but I'm feeling called to go deeper and get more in depth training and education regarding the body and integrative/functional medicine so I can help people on a deeper level (with the credentials to back up what I know)."
I have attended many lectures from Lifestyle Doctors and have learned a lot over the years.  I am an RN, and while working in the hospital, I felt the need of this kind of training.  I have given some vegetarian/vegan cooking classes.  I have supported my chiropractor husband in his work.  I wanted to be a nurse practitioner, but that has not ever happened.  I love talking to others and sharing health information.  I am getting older and due to stressful living, I have some of my own health issues.  My husband is now retiring and I can pursue some education for myself now.  I still need to earn a living, but it doesn't have to be huge numbers.  I think our health system is broken, and would love to help people navigate their health, working with their own body's God-given ability to heal itself and addressing the cause of the problem, and not just treat symptoms.
Burned out of nursing and need a change with less stress on my body.
I want functional medicine
I’ve been a labor and delivery nurse for 22 years. I’ve loved my work, and getting to travel nurse the majority of my career has afforded me a wonderful, adventurous life. I even lived in Africa for 11 years doing community health and development. However, for about the last 8 years, I’ve grown unhappy with the way we do “healthcare” and have found that it no longer aligns with my values and beliefs. Around 2019, I began to wake up to the realization that our healthcare system is so broken, we don’t cure anything, and people are sicker now more than ever. I want to help people live the way God intended humans to live…healthy, vibrant, happy. I am no longer happy with bedside nursing. I can’t bring myself to do the things to newborns that I’m required to do because it violates my beliefs (vaccines at 1 hour old). Honestly, I’ve already taken a course in functional medicine for nurses. It was good. I just need more help in getting an actually profitable business off the ground as soon as possible. My goal is January. Is that too ambitious? I already have my LLC but have never done anything with it. Too scared? Don’t know where to actually start? Imposter syndrome? Never owned my own business? Yes to all of it. But I’m tired of not taking action. People in my life and my community are asking for this and now is the time to take action.
Its promised high paying and freedom to be with my family.
I want to be a nurse coach and help people with chronic disease but can not yet afford nurse coach training and this seemed a good first step
I have been contemplating being a health coach or resource for a few years.   I have had many clients just want to chat about what is going on and have also been a patient advocate or medical ear and sounding board for many family members.     I have had the blessed opportunity to attend a few longevity conferences and love learning.    My husband recently had a heart attack and we have had a scare with lesions found in his body.   He is struggling with other health issues and we are working through the process.    I have a massage therapy busy where we sell herbs and other products and services.   It is now time to take this where I see it going in the future.
I am sick of being sick but told I'm not.
The short answer is that I feel a calling to heal. The longer answer is I’d like to be able to heal myself.
My wife and I are nurses that realize that the medical system alone is not helping anyone.   We are seriously considering establishing a business for functional coaching, physical training options and functional nutrition.  We are enrolled in a few courses this is one of them.
I have one of my children who was born 27 weeks premature. I have a nurse working 24/7 at my house. I need to see if I can help my son when the nurse doesn't show, that is my why
"Honestly, right now I'm feeling manipulated and not sure I'm doing the right thing, and here's why. I'm a straightforward person; No fluff needed. It wasn't until after I gave my payment information that I was told that the $97 was only for level 1, which doesn't deal with the more involved cases. One of the main reasons why I'm wanting to do this is that I have a daughter suffering with a pretty debilitating autoimmune disease, and I want to help her in any way I can; and as an RN, I've felt frustrated not being able to really help her, and witnessing doctors dismissing her symptoms.  Apparently, I had to spend $397 extra in order to deal with illnesses on that level. I felt this a bit deceptive. But, I went along with it and am praying this whole program isn't a scam. That's how my heart is feeling right now. This played out like a typical marketing ploy that, unfortunately, I am very familiar with. Now, with that off my chest, I will share a little about me that brought me here. I am a BSN nurse of 32 years who has worked in adult cardiac, neonatal intensive care, longterm care, and hospice care. Due to my heart for the elderly, I left hospice to open my own private senior care home. We ran that for 9 yrs and sold a year and a half ago due to staffing issues after COVID.  I was working on starting a senior care management business when I started to learn more and more about functional medicine in looking for answers for my daughter. My Mom also suffers with some chronic issues, as well. I'm looking to start a new chapter in using my nursing skills and desire to help people to make a difference."
The last 10 years I’ve been interested in natural/alternative health. The more I learn about our “sick care” system, the faster I’m running in the other direction. In 2021-2023 I completed levels I and II of an empowerment coaching certification program as well as level I in hypnosis and NLP. I have yet to do anything with those but thought if/when I did, I’d to focus more on health coaching. I’m also interested in having something ready for retirement. I’m 62, working full time and will probably have to work until my full retirement age of 67.  I would love to retire sooner than later if I could.
When I was growing up I have struggled school, barely passed High school, flunked jr. college, worked at various jobs, never really being able to hold it down for a long time. Got married then she divorced me 6 years later. Was diagnosed with MDD and had 2 attempts in 2012 when I was 24. And have struggled with depression  and SI nonstop. I wanted to be a HS music teacher. And so since I loved teaching merit badges at BSA summer camps, I got into being a paraprofessional. With Autistic students. 2 years in the para position, I was desperate for any relief from the MDD and was on Medi-Cal and was approved for Electroconvulsive Therapy, (ECT … same as in “the one who flew over the cuckoo’s nest”) and did over 60 treatments. Later that year I met my the love of my life (now my wife) and got married  once things started opening up after Covid, in 2021. Two years ago I finally made I breakthrough with my SI and started addressing that. Then last year I started my spiritual healing when going through the 3 levels of becoming a prayer Minister. Then This year has been shocking because I found out I have 2 gene mutations with my MTHFR and really want everyone to know about it and the solution with Enlyte and how it is possible and helping me. I love teaching people and love seeing that lightbulb go off in their heads when they understand it. I enjoy helping people and have always been fascinated with the medical field. I have always enjoyed Math and Science. And ELA has been my biggest struggle.  Why I chose this because currently working with the current charter school that my job feels boring. (there are a few times where I feel like I get to teach and help a student, though to far separated from each other.) currently I’m getting treatment for MDD / treatment resistant depression with an integrated Treatment Doctor and am fascinated by her approach and how much it has helped me in this short 5 months vs. the 13 years from 2012-2025. Hopefully this gives a good snapshot of me. I also am a husband and Father of 5 kids (15,13,11,5,3.5 years old) I also married into the 3 older boys. So my life is chaotic with lots to do and not enough time.
I have a BS in Healthcare Admin, Minor in Gerontology, and computer based training certifications...currently working 9-5/Job for a medical manufacturing company...looking to build a retirement income that I can do from home...help people, get paid well...without pushing the long hours.  I have two years to retirement...looking for full-time income with part time effort...and able to be be my own Boss.
"God called me to become a nurse in my early 30's, after being in Retail and Hospitality Management all during my 20's. Earned my RN in 2013 (36 yo), then in 2014, God said I would have a Global Dementia Biz - that Freaked me out!!! I worried about licenses and buildings and international laws, and it caused A-fib one night actually, for about 15 minutes, until I used breathwork to revert back to the parasympathic nervous system. A telehealth nurse said I should have a full cardiac workup and that I was putting my life in danger by not going to the ER. That infuriated me. I know how to handle my body, I was just overwhelmed with God's vision. This was all before Online Courses and Coaching was popular.  In 2022, I finally figured out how to create and online course, with Kajabi, and recorded videos and learned how to write an eBook (all without AI...lol) for my ""Decrease Dementia - Naturally and without pharmaceuticals"". I had been researching holistic/whole body health, like they teach in RN school, and truly fell in love with teaching people about reducing the chronic inflammation in their body to reverse and prevent: dementia (type 3 diabetes now), diabetes, congestive heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and alllllll the side effects of those major diseases - all due to inflammation and adrenal fatigue.  (tried to promote my course on YouTube and Instagram, not a single client or eBook sale yet. So, I inform the church ladies and they listen, but don't apply - so I knew I needed to learn how to coach effectively for transformation and to have the patient want to do this, instead of have to do this. I've been praying in November of 2025 - what God wants me to do, since I was not able to make any of these business ideas work.  Then your $97 ad came up on Instagram - thank you Sarah and God!!! Finally, a course where I can get the certifications (even International - so I can have a Global Business, like God said!!!) and the Coaching Training - to learn How to be an effective coach for client's transformation (what I had been looking for!), and the business skills - set up, Bookkeeping, Legal for scope of practice, and how to market, scale, and exit - this is an Extraordinary Course!!!! Others only sell pieces of this for $2000-$8000 - none of which I could afford, since I have no credit cards with my Bankruptcy. I am truly blown away by your course - I've opened all the modules to see the section titles, and I'm so blown away. This is what I've been looking for!!! Thank you soooo much Sarah!!!"
I want to improve my self and help as many as I can
I have always wanted to work in the natural health industry. I have started aromatherapy, enrolled nursing didn’t complete either. Functional medicine and herbal medicine is something that I have been following and using for a few years. Now it’s my turn to be on the other side helping others to heal from health issues that western medicine is not seeing or helping to heal.
I'm a graduate student in clinical mental health counseling. I was considering starting a coaching business while completing the practicum and internship requirements to supplement my income.
Chronic pain and gut issues
Good morning.  I just want a life where I feel like I’m truly contributing.  I was a nurse I gave up my license after Covid when I realized that I had spent so much time off the floor and administration that I was no longer true asset to the floor doing patient care.  I’ve become burnt out in the toxic environment that is my job. I just want to help people feel good about it and trust that what I’m doing has value.
I have been wanting to incorporate functional medicine into my practice but haven’t had time and money since I opened my own practice.
Have been working hours of nursing jobs and recently had a work injury, since the injury has been under paid and want my life back
I love staying healthy and helping others with discovering why they do not feel the way that I do, so felt this would be a good investment for me and my future.
It is my calling to help people! I am passionate to get to the root cause and help people deal with the under cause. What causes the symptoms in the first place. Not manage symptoms with medication and stop there. But deal with the cause of the disease. What we eat and how it affects us, and our daily routine activities. I am a nurse. I see everyday how people are being mismanaged and being referred to different specialists with no actual results, and are being told you need to take more prescription medications. I wished I could do more for them. Help them live a live of freedom in their own body.
Identifying problems and finding solutions for myself and others is fascinating work and something I can be passionate about. Being paid for that knowledge and value is even more motivating to me.
I am an RN and I always feel like the way patients are treated in healthcare is just to suppress the symptoms. I would like to learn the root causes and help them heal by the Grace of God.
"I have an integrative nutrition certificate but kept it mostly for my personal use. When I had the opportunity to share my knowledge with others I did it pro bono. Never started and used my knowledge for income. 
I am a dental hygienist and I was able to make it an addition to my treatment planning"
I have psoriasis and thyroid. My son has autism and mental disability
"My journey began as a physician trained abroad, and for the past 20+ years I’ve worked as a registered nurse here in the U.S., primarily in case management, research, and quality improvement. Over the last 15 years, care management has truly become the center of my professional life, it’s where I’ve found the deepest meaning in helping people navigate complex health systems and improve their outcomes. More recently, I’ve moved closer to the integration of mental health and behavioral health, and I see how critical this is for whole-person care. Investing in this certification felt right because it aligns with my lifelong commitment to making a tangible difference in people’s lives. It’s not just about advancing my career; it’s about equipping myself with the tools to serve patients more fully, with compassion, evidence, and impact. I am also on my way to completing my PMHNP, expect to graduate early in 2027."
"I'm a registered nurse, and have worked in many different fields. But I'm disappointed in the lack of care that is in our health""care"" system. Especially as a woman. I feel like we are often overlooked, due to male doctors thinking we are ""just emotional,"" or women doctors not digging deep enough or trusting their own clinical judgement. I believe this program can bridge the disconnect. This program seems to be just what I have been searching for (for a long time), that will help me feel like I'm helping my patients, rather than just throwing pills, ordered by doctors who may not even have listened closely enough to get it right, at my patients. I decided to go ahead with the advanced programs so I can be successful out of the gate."
A lot of current business issues, not equipped to handle patient issues.
Get out of business debt, try to get contracts with corporate companies, credibility with those companies
I have been a nurse for over 14yrs, got into holistic health when my husband was diagnosed with MS. I discovered healing protocols involving diet changes, mindset shifts and spiritual wholeness, I used holistic healing for DM, obesity, leukemia but I want to start my practice without becoming an NP…. I want to go deeper clinically to make a difference with preventable diseases.
"I have been a Functional Health and Lifestyle Wellness Specialist Practitioner since 2005. On my own personal health and body wellness journey since 1991 - People are my passion. I have dedicated my life to helping others live their best life! I help people live a healthy, well, fit, strong, whole life from the inside out without fad diets and limiting programs. Specializing in fitness, nutrition, weight management - targeting our overall health and body wellness. I help people regain control of their life by getting to the root cause of their struggles; internal health as well as mental and emotional health. I provide Food Testing, Nutrient Testing and Personal Attention. I have the solutions to unhealthy causes.

The importance of being proactive in our own health, body wellness and internal health. We need to pay attention to and be open minded to what our body is telling us. Not everything is ""age related"", ""gender related"" nor can it be ""fixed"" with pills."
All my life I’ve always wanted to be a doctor, particularly a surgeon what time and money lead me to take prerequisites for nursing instead. I completed my prerequisites and received an associates of arts in 2007 and was on the nursing program waitlist at the time I was living back in Michigan, which is where my family is originally from but I moved back to Arizona joined a nursing program waitlist and then in 2010 I moved to California and also joined a nursing program waitlist. In 2015 I moved back to Arizona to help my parents care for my grandmother who suffered from dementia, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. I joined a nursing waiting program again when I moved back. Job wise in between these times I was and still in a licensed cosmetologist and like the Salon being my mother owned one and also was an insurance I’ve done both property and casualty and in most recent years life and health selling Medicare but none of these jobs are fulfilling for me. I still have always wanted to be in the medical.  It took a course starting on clinical research to finally start with the Pima medical Institute nursing program in September 2020. However, from the little had already learned from my clinical research class I knew the way things were being handled during Covid were unethical. I had started having more interest and coming across more of those into holistic practices, which definitely aligns more with desire of helping people to be able to get to the root of the problem. I truly feel our medical system. Here has failed many and is greedy in our adjusting to managing and having sick care. Don’t get me wrong definitely we do need telepathic medicine sometimes, but I truly want to help people by getting to the root cause of the issues and also because so many people in my family have been hurt through medical malpractice. I have two beautiful nephews who turned autistic after two I have another one who had H5. A doctor ripped off all of his toenails because he said he had a fungus when he didn’t, and now he has severe psoriasis on his feet & legs. My mother has always had a edema in her legs and weeklong who catches pneumonia like a cold. My father, who has always been a perfect picture of health, but during Covid times and the fear mongering the way things represented in the media. He was always click to roll the sleeves and get every shot and booster and now all of a sudden, I don’t know where he has a heart problem and they were unsure if he would live Pass the next two years, but he did respond well to medication and they said he’s a poster child but now my father, who’s never had to be on medication for anything is on medication right now for life and I really don’t feel he needs to be. I myself have PCOS and I have a friend who was in NATURAL PATH, who has helped me and getting my period back regulated so that my husband and I can realize our dream of becoming parents in the near future hopefully.  I have a uncle who’s had diabetes and cancer and Aunt with MS that came out of nowhere.  and as time has gone on, I do know a lot of things go back to parasites. Besides all these medical issues that I have seen personally touch my family even within the African-American community autism is now an epidemic and that’s not coincidental. Literally every family within my circle that has a son that is two years old that was on the American vaccine schedule ended up being autistic after their two year-old vaccines and it is just truly heartbreaking seeing families trying to navigate And get assistance that they need from a healthcare system that has failed them . These are the things that drive me to want to assist others. This is my Y really wanting to help my family and others get rid of these terrible issues once and for all or at least get it to a place where they can manage and be functional. My nephews are definitely a prime concern for me. I am grateful that my family have tried things that I have just learned throughout the years through personal research of things to do and we have seen some improvements, but it is my mission to get down to the bottom of this and help my babies be able to be functioning members of society by helping them heal their gut… I also didn’t end up starting the nursing program that I was accepted to in September 2020 because at the time I did not want to be forced to take a vaccine nor be in a mass 12+ hours a day I felt there were other ways. There were no improving natural ways, but without side effects that have helped people beat Covid. If that was something I was going to even catch, and I was confident at the naturopathic protocols of an illness that only had a .01% death rate..  I did unfortunately have to get the vaccine though to be able to travel so in November 2021 I caved and I went into the office bawling my eyes out because I did not want to take it and they had to watch me for 30 minutes after giving it to me because the left side of my face started to numb up For about five minutes after they gave me the J&J shot. I did follow some protocols. I came across from some natural communities and I do know a couple of naturopathic doctors and nurses to try and help get rid of some of that stuff for my sister…. In May 2023 I’m at the love of my life and have been living over in West Africa, traveling back-and-forth between the states, but the first seven months of my marriage when me and my husband temporarily stayed in Ghana before returning to his homeland, Nigeria, I started having issues with my cycle And I had diarrhea for six months straight.  Thanks for the help of my friend who is a holistic nurse practitioner I realize, and I was heavenly infested with parasites, and so I started doing some cleanses, but it has really disrupted my gut of which I am still working with, but it has improved so and things finally seem to be getting back on track after two years, so I’m really hoping to be able to become a mother and get pregnant in 2026 as these issues have definitely affected my Fertility. I still am currently back-and-forth between the United States of Nigeria due to the ridiculous immigration system here going on 2 1/2 years still waiting. So I come back work a little bit then go back to Nigeria so I really wanna take this time while I’m back in Nigeria to focus completely on my holistic courses because I love being able to work remote and help people to achieve results from any corner of the world….So that’s just a little bit about me and my whys. Sorry I know it’s a long read, but I am so excited to be able to do something that I truly believe I have a calling for. I look forward to meeting you or speaking with you one of these days in the near future Sarah.
Wanted to see whether it’s feasible for me at this stage of my career.
I’m on a spiritual retreat and I heard the calling.
This is my calling
I have been a nurse for 16 years but have become increasingly more interested in functional health for chronic disorders.  I want to learn as much as I can about finding the root cause and not just treating symptoms.
I was recently diagnosed pre diabetic. once I started working with a nutrionist I became intrigued about lifestyle changes to help change my health. Also I take care of my mother who was hospitalized this year with b12 deficiency. with excercise and lifestyle changes she has improved. I am now on a journey where I want to help her and I live healthier lives as well as helping others
"The ad got my attention like a beaming headlight. I liked what you said it resonated with me. I felt it was a great certification that ad to my current bio and would support my work tremendously. I have a life time passion of helping people live a healthier, more harmonious life. My dedication to this passion began at age 16 when I began my nursing career. It was things i noticed about the way patients were not getting better, and when 4 patient in the same room had the same diagnosis on the same treatment yet they did not fully recover. I was intrigued and when an opportunity to be a seniour scrub nurse in the operating theatres presented itself I jumped at it. i wanted to know what we look like inside and what disease looks like. It was a profound experience in with a patient that changed my acceptance of sickness and disease. We opened her up to remove an abdominal tumour, when we got to the augmentum it was grey and lumpy. The surgeon said ""Suture up"" we had not done anything. he saw my quizzical look and said ""Well nurse, you can see the same as me. This lady has 14 days to live"" he asked that I go with him to deliver the news, which to this day is not protocol. She was not fully conscious when we went to her bedside. He spoke to her, she smiled until he said ""When you are awake I want your husband to take you home. In 8 days you will return to the hospital as you will be very unwell. Enjoy the days at home with your family. You have 14 days to live"" We walked away leaving her in tears. On the 8th day I admitted her to the ward, she was very unwell. I laid her out on the 14th day. I cried as I did and I made a pledge to her, I wanted her life to mean more than ""14 days"" I said I would go on a quest to know more of what is illness, disease and dying is, in her honour. And I have been on that quest for over 36 years. I have a natural ability to see into the body and energy fields like an MRI machine only I am more precise. The different studies/certificates I have done have provided a foundation that I unite with that natural ability for me   to help clients. I am thrilled and deeply grateful to take up this course with you Sarah."
My parents health have declined rapidly this year and I’m seeing the writing on the wall with all the doctor visits with no positive results. It’s now or never for them. So if I can’t help them soon, they won’t be around as long or have much good health left. I would like to help my family, friends and others that are tired of the dead ends with the doctors and are looking for real solutions other than more drugs and surgery.
i was blessed by natural medicine and lost 90 pounds
I have been a nurse for almost 50 years and no longer have the passion or energy to continue clinical nursing. My passion is too help others lead a healthier (physical, emotional and mental) life.
I believe the body was created to heal.
I had long Covid and was very sick and researched the holistic way of healing the body and and basically it healed and I would like to help other people heal their body
"I have been studying prevention and wellness for my own personal well being for 40+ years. It has served me well. I come across women and men frequently with health issues. I have some knowledge from Young Living Essential Oils since 2001 and other seminars, and personal learning and yet I feel like I have part of the knowledge, if someone was to follow me and trust me - I can help them. However, just to take my word for it and not have ""facts, figures, data"" to back it up what I ""say"" it falls flat and nothing happens. Mean time I am a busy girl so if you want it, you will have to actively seek me out. I am over trying to convince anyone of a better method. Too many times I hear, my insurance covers it so I will go this other route.  Overall in would say I am in excellent health and over 60 people usually think I am in my 40's. Plus I have a lot of energy, more than most. And I have many people I know with various health issues that I would like to help."
I want to get out of bedside nursing, work for myself and help people in a different way.
I was diagnosed with PCOS and could not conceive. After lots of research and changing lots of my habits,along with using an herb called False Unicorn, I healed myself and managed to get pregnant twice.I would like to use what I learn from you to coach people on how to have happy healthy pregnancies.
To be honest, I did it mostly for myself, to heal myself. I suffer from a long time bulimia, mental health also my daughter has mental health issues. If I can heal myself and plus be able to help others on the way, I would be finally happy and content with my life.
Quest to empower self-healing beyond medical solutions
To be honest I am here because first of all I want to heal myself and if in the process of healing I can help others the better. I also would like to have something meaningful into my life with what I can achieve financial independence. I am 53 years old, I live in Switzerland, but I am originally from Hungary. I was a stay at home mom, always doing some side hustle, just wanted to be there for my children, here in Switzerland, children come home for lunch and there are days when they don’t need to go back to school, so I decided to be a stay at home mom. Now my children are grown ups, and I try to find a job since 5 years now, with absolutely no success. Ageism is a thing in Switzerland, which I was not aware of but I can see that now. Today a I saw your ad on Facebook and something resonated and so here I am.
"Hi Sarah! I'm 35 and feeling so far behind on my career. I can do Admin and Customer Service with my eyes closed but I truly want to help change people's lives. I've considered taking personal training qualifications and moving towards supporting people with optimizing mobility but I've been putting that off for over 2 years. I guess that was the Universe telling me something more effective was on its way. 
The variety of specialist options intrigues me and I know the investment is worth just wanting to fix things for myself. From my over 4 years as a meditation and breathwork facilitator and my interest in finding root causes to better understand myself and others my curiosity can be a little insatiable but I truly feel this is the ""title"" I've been desiring."
Quest to self-heal beyond doctor diagnosis
"I have struggled personally for many years with weight loss resistance, migraines, arthritis, chronic pain, and now heart issues. I have spent tens of thousands on doctors, coaches, supplements, and devices — all to little result.  

I have 3 adult children all with different “chronic” issues and “normal” bloodwork. I see them starting down the same path I have been on, and I just want to learn what I can to help myself, them, and others.

I have been searching for another functional practitioner but feel like maybe I just need to learn it myself."
"I have been on my fitness & health journey for more than 40 years. I am a former 100% Natural (no drugs ever used) professional fitness model & bodybuilder; 3 times Mr. Natural USA & 6 times “Top 5 in the World”.  However, I succumbed to illness in my 40’s. I struggled for 10 years trying to recover from leaky gut syndrome, diverticulitis, colitis, and other issues. I have things under control now (in basic remission) and continue to take care of myself daily with the use of superfoods, herbs, and other supplements. I also, help others with gut issues that lead to all forms of inflammation. I want to learn more to help others more."
I am a registered nurse who works at an elementary school. I have co-workers, concerned parents, and my own family members who come to me with questions because their healthcare provider is unable to help them relieve their symptoms. I have recently been researching herbal medicine, and I’m convinced that herbal remedies/diet should always be our first go to instead of jumping straight to the pharmaceuticals. I’m really excited to start this journey! Can’t wait to learn more!
"Honestly, I became aware of functional medicine a few years ago, when my husband and I were drinking heavily and both experiencing health issues. I had gained about 30 lbs, had no energy, and eventually had a stroke-like migraine followed by an intense catharsis, deep crying. My husband was at least 70lbs over weight, and suffered with arthritis, chronic inflammation and stress, as well as intense muscle cramps. I found us a functional medicine practitioner and she changed our lives. We lost all the weight, gained all the energy, most of our symptoms disappeared, quit drinking, and life became fun and manageable again. I've always been excited about science and became even more passionate about biochemistry during the rollout of covid and the vaccines along with our learning and healing journey with our practitioner. I've always loved helping people and feeling my best, but it hasn't been something I've been able to stick to easily. My husband and I did (and still do) tremendous research into world affairs such as the bio-cyber interface, digital ID's and digital prisons, the inhumane ""health"" care system, government corruption, power hungry corporations etc. While I feel it's extremely important to stay abreast of what's transpiring on our planet and to all of us as humans, I became stuck in a really dark depression and overall anxiety in dealing with the world and being a part of it, so I turned to drinking yet again. My husband and I eventually separated because things got so bad between us, and both of us fell back into ill health all the way around. Functional Medicine is my calling, I can feel it in my heart. I believe the best way for me to live is empowered by the changes I can make in my own life, and to assist others in defending their health and their rights. I'm proud to say I have 2 months sober, just landed a full time job at a holistic animal vet, and am finally taking the wisdom I already have and applying it to myself again. I'm feeling energized, motivated, clear headed, and losing weight. I absolutely love learning about the human body and biochemistry, and I'm more excited than I've ever been about starting my own business and creating a life of time and financial freedom. I love that your course incorporates all aspects of this, and I'm truly excited to be learning with you!"
I love to learn about how to help how to heal and make a difference to the normal medical system, I suffer from chronic pain also I am exposed to mold also I love to finnisch my university degree and love to learn in English and I am interested in knowing about the optimal health e g hormonal health for women not just the standard that’s normal you have to accept what’s happening , also I just love to learn and be professional and to earn effortlessly with purpose and real value 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I help people for free with natural health and want to instead up level my skills and also get paid and paid well. I am a busy mom and (passionate but low-paid) head teacher.
I have been a family physician for > 30 years.  I think listening and compassion are my strengths.  I still feel wanting at times.  When I have time to study I work faster.  Still people say integrative medicine, functional medicine and natural medicine have answers I may not have.  My communications skills and boundary setting can improve.  I'm excited to be welcomed to this community.  I am ready to work less and try to retire at least part time!
All my life all I've ever wanted to be was a doctor, particularly a surgeon. I've always been drawn to the medical field but due to time and money opted to go the nursing route. I took all my prerequisites and received my associates of arts degree while being put on eternal waitlist for the programs since 2007. I had moved back to Arizona from Michigan to California and back to Arizona again From 2008-2023. Of Course I joined the waitlist whenever I moved. I had moved from Cali back to Arizona in 2015 to help my parents in caregiving for my grandmother that suffered from Parkinson's, Alzheimers and Dementia heart breaking to watch her deteriorate. I peered into other medical career options as well such as clinical research. I took a brief course on that which really helped raise my antennas when covid came on the scene. I very quick realized the game being played and how unethically things were being handled. Over the years I noticed how they try to discredit or keep hidden those helping people heal naturally since of course big Pharma doesn't want to get to the root. Don't get me wrong there are absolutely times when we need allopathic care but the healthcare system here in America is driven by greed instead of really helping people. I've seen this too many times and with medical Mal practiced that has happened to my close family members. I had 2 nephews that went autistic around 2 years of age post vaccines.  As an African American woman I have seen this in our community with those who have sons that were on todays vaccine schedule which has at least doubled since the 80's. It's an epidemic within the black community and its heart breaking seeing the families of such ones navigate to get healing for a system that has failed them. a seem this in pretty much ever  In Sept of 2020 I was finally supposed to start a nursing course at Pima medical institute However the way covid was being handled and the vaccines they were forcing people to take didn't sit with well me, nor did being in a mask 12+ hours a day if I declined the vaccine. I realized the terrible state our healthcare is in and know I will have to serve my purpose of helping people to heal in a natural way. So many have been failed by the system that more and more people are looking for an alternative route. With the rising cost of premiums and medications I believe people will have no choice but to return to the natural route and want tube able to be a part of that change and make a true difference. Cant wait to get started. Looking forward to meeting or speaking with you.
Hi Sarah :) Honestly, I am 47 years old and I am a healer by nature and find immense joy in helping people live their best quality of life, but in the last couple years I have felt more drained than joyous. I'm going through perimenopause, raising a teen that deals with some huge life struggles, cared for a sick parent for 2 years before he passed a year ago this last Monday, worrying about a mother whose now alone and too far from me to watch over.......and running a full time business that feels like its sucking the life out of my husband and I. Kind of wondering what door Joy left from? lol. I used to do one on one sessions with Nutrition clients, and I loved it but there were two issues, one is that I couldn't earn what I needed to support our family and lifestyle, and two.....although I believe nutrition is so important, I wished I could offer people more. My husband and I happened to get involved with an amazing health technology 10 years ago that led to a career in sales. Very rewarding as I was helping people while also being rewarded financially. Unfortunately, that job we had created has taken a turn and is no longer feeling the same and certainly is not producing the same financial freedom as it was. It's been two years of feeling drained and not feeling less secure financially. I want to return to my work with clients but in a wy that allows me more time with my family and supports me financially. I saw your program for a few months and it just resonated with me and so here I am :)  I am ready to work smarter and really enjoy my job, find my joy again......and makes some money doing it!!!  lol.    This won't be shared anywhere will it?  lol. As I was writing, I thought I really hope this is just a private convo .  lol. Looking forward to I'm doing this part time so might take a little longer than others.
I have a big story strting at an early age with health issuesd. But to fast forward I have been in Architecture and land development for over 20 years. I have lived with a rare blood immune disorder form 28 to survciving non secretoral Multi myloma. My siaste wne t a different direction than me 4 years ago with her cancer battlem and passed away this summe.
A lifetime of keeping myself alive as a professional in architecture and land development. Doctors couldn't help a rare blood disorder and non-secreting multiple myeloma since the age of 28. My sister passed away this past summer from cancer, and I had no real training to help her in the way I found functional health and nutrition—a passion for education and changing lives.

Would like to go into business for myself when I retire. I would like to focus on wellness and disease prevention.
I am an LPN and a mother of two incredible children plus a wife. I am planning to start my RN program this coming Winter and I love solving health problems. My husband and I are very fatigued and we have gained weight, I want to start by solving our health problems first and get us to healthy weight and not feeling tired all the time. Then I want to work from home and still be  able to help others with their health issues. I love anatomy and physiology and I want to be able to solve the root cause of diseases and help as many people with chronic illnesses live a full healthy life.
I feel stuck, I injured myself halfway through a nursing degree which has pushed it back by18mths before I can graduate. Hubby and I would like to travel and that was our plan to be able to do so. I feel like I have let us down.
I had thyroid (hypothyroidism) symptoms for 7 years, and doctors told me my blood tests were fine and that I was perfectly fine. I gradually lost my ability to work, and was having debilitating gut symptoms and constant neck pain. Last year I found a functional medicine coach, who finally helped me and directed me to a functional medicine doctor abroad, and finally I have gained back my health.
I’m a health coach and personal trainer. I want to add a level of knowledge to my coaching that I know will help me as well as my clients.
I am a FNP and want to be able to offer my patients more. In addition I would like to offer more outside of the office I work for and have a business on the side to help retire and enjoy life
I'm already a BCPA & certified in regenerative cosmetics, and saw your certificate posted on IG, thought it would be good to add as I'm now doing a lot more with peptides, functional, and longevity medicine in my consulting practice.
I am looking to expand my scope of practice and ability to help my clients.
NP and on my own practice, but looking to expand my coaching skills for wellness, thyroid, hormones, etc.
I personally have had health struggles and have always been interested in holistic health and want to increase knowledge and potentially help others.
I'm burnt out on chiropractic. I'm looking for something that excites me. I really want to help severely troubled patients. Weight loss and balancing hormones is very exciting to me. Also, helping people with Lyme's would be awesome.
I am 62 years old and have received my masters degree as an FNP pretty late in life - age 58 to be exact.  I love what I do but I feel as if there is more to do.  In addition I am buried in student loans and wonder how I will ever retire after accumulating debt that I acquired to help others.  So, I am going all in bc I want to help others and I want to be able to pay off debts and still help others and not be married to my charting at home.   As I see it my FNP and this certification will go hand in hand.
I am a Registered Dietitian and I have always viewed the body as a whole. On my own I've learned about Integrative and Functional Nutrition but I want to get formal training in order to best support my patients. I've learned a lot through personal experiences with autoimmune diseases but having the firm knowledge base is crucial.
It's an interest I've always had.
I’m an acupuncturist and hormone specialist who helps women over 40 reset their hormones naturally. I want more coaching skills.
"I am a certified CBT life coach. Right now, I help moms lead with emotional intelligence at home & business, so they can raise empowered kids with EI, EF, and AI literacy.  
As you can guess, my work always starts with the mom or grandmom – they want to help their kids, but they need to help themselves first.  I am a bit of a neuroscience geek, so I always use science-backed facts in my methods, including some NLP. 

My work has pivoted due to need and my own passion, to teaching these moms how to teach their kids to use AI safely with EI and EF, so they can feel secure that they are Future Ready.  The first problem is that they are not ready to help their kids.  Some realize this, others are resistant to say the least.  I want to feel more qualified to guide them.

My passion for this comes from my personal experience.  I struggled for many years with ignoring my own feelings and instincts to go with the flow.  This led me to literally waste years going through the motions until I finally woke up and realized that I was not living my life, I was merely surviving.  I don't want others to have to waste years when they don't have to."
I’m already a physician but I primarily practice aesthetics. I’m board certified in internal medicine but I don’t practice and in fact after residency never practiced. Went straight to aesthetics. I’ve been adding weight loss and peptides to my practice but as a physician I want to have a baseline of functional medicine without having to go through a long fellowship program.
I am a nurse by trade and my wife is an educator. We have a lavender farm where we handcraft a variety of products for our customers. In addition to those products, we also offer an abundance of health and wellness products for our customers such as supplements, essential oils, protein powders, electrolytes, etc. We continue to get asked about functional medicine and ways to improve their health. Thats why I signed up.
Functional and Integrative Medicine is where it’s at!
I want improve my health and others
I have a passion for health. As a RN I like to help people. I also feel there is always more to the story, and I would like to help figure this out.
Looking to add tools and education to address complex cases.
I’m a nurse and love holistic care
I’ve been nurse for 19 years, between ICU and ER nursing. For the past 9 years I have been interested in holistic lifestyle and have been disappointed in how conventional healthcare treats patients concentrating on symptom management instead of root causes.
Helping others
Personally very medically complex. Pre-med background looking to go into osteopathic medicine (DO) and want to be able to assist myself and others in holistic ways when possible
My business needs an edge
"My Health Journey with Epstein Barr and ALL that God gave me to learn. I am often asked for help or opinions from others that are trying to find True help amidst the www and AI black holes. ""Traditional Western Med"" had NO answers or help because they are not taught Whole Body cause or preventive or Natural Support & Solutions. I am called to be a Servant & a Warrior."
"Hi, Sarah, so happy to meet you. I am a chef and a hobby nutritionist. I am 46 years old, and it is time to learn something else for my future. I have been looking for options for months now, and this course is the first one that stuck with me.
Personally, I dont trust the clinical medicine system,ergo , even if I dont get rich from this, I get rich in knowledge. My dream is to get into health, but not relying on a salary. I am dreaming of working remote, and this fits perfectly."
I know that I can help my clients on a deeper level.
As a holistic esthetician I want to be able to understand my clients better and guide them into improving their overall wellness.
I’ve been a licensed occupational therapist for decades. I have a license in social work as well. I love being an OT. I chose to drop my SW license (which was foolish at the time), because my passion is helping people through OT. SW skills are also used and building but OT considers the entire person. Your program (I hope) will help me to serve my clients more in-depth and help them to resolve issues… which is my goal in helping humans to be their best as they age ( at ANY AGE).
I’m a wellness practitioner and I know a lot about the body but I need the science behind it. All I do is intuitive and somatic and I get great results but I don’t have a certification to show that’s why I decided to take this certification and be backed up by lawyers. I’m excited
Completed RN degree, wanting to become holistic health nurse..needed in today's world.
I just answered this on the initial application… but, here it is in short: I’ve been working in the health care arena for over 45 years. I treat the ‘whole’ person. Physical, mental, social, spiritual, emotional (and the rest) to be as independent as possible, through the journey of the healing process.
I have several illness and I work with others who do as well with my LCSW.
I am a board certified health Coach and functional medicine nutritionist but need guidance on the business side to truly help and empower others. I have had my own health journey and feel called to help and empower others! Thank you
I was diagnosed with a rare disease in 2015. It devastated my life. I was bedridden within 6 months and every time I went to sleep I wasn’t sure if I would wake up. I was in so much pain that I was in peace with that except for leaving my kids. In the last 10 years I earned a PhD, and another “master’s” in my disease. My life has improved tremendously. Unfortunately, my son died from the same disease. I want to be able to help women improve their daily lives and health in a way the medical system cannot. I don’t ever want to tell someone I don’t believe their symptoms because it doesn’t match what I was taught in medical school - a place that still rarely studies women.
I am a Medical Massage Therapist and I would like to add functional medicine coaching to my practice
I am retiring in June, 2026,  from elementary education after 25 years. When evaluating my next stage, I really wanted to continue to help people learn more about how to be the best and healthiest they can be. I’ve been struggling myself with weight gain through menopause, finding my medical practitioner is not very helpful, and doing a lot of research on my own. I find this topic interesting and empowering. I’m also looking for a career that gives me flexibility, work on my terms, and provide a comfortable lifestyle.
I coach clients to improve their health outcome inspired by my own health journey
I am very interested in functional medicine
Overworked medical assistant trying to make a charge for better for myself and my family
As far back as I can remember, I have been curious about what makes the human body function.  I have also been interested in electronics, various processes  and how almost anything worked.  I was discouraged by many about going into medicine because it was changing so fast and becoming an insurance servant instead of taking care of the person.  Now at 67, I am not going to let any of that hold me back.  Years ago I got a BS in Physics and a MS in Biology (Immunology and Clinical Ultrasound).  I have watched family members needlessly suffer through the medical processes most doctors follow and people ignore me because what do I know.  Because I don't see a practical way of becoming an MD, your certification looked like a safe start to see if I can contribute to my family's life, my life and many others who need help.

I am a burnt out PA sick of throwing pills at all my patients. Plus I have personally had amazing results from working with a functional medicine provider. The combinations of those two things led me to this!
Expand my wellness career
fga
I used to be a Professional Herbalist (about 20 years ago) and I loved helping people but didn’t have the business skillset and wasn’t brave enough to really put myself out there to sell. Then I started working in corporate financial leadership and completed my Executive MBA degree. Just left my corporate job in October 2025 and recertified as a Certified High Performance Coach in at the beginning of November and am working on my business and offering. I’ve got the business acumen to be an entrepreneur and presence to be a coach but would love to bring that altogether with my passion for health and alternative medicine. With an undergraduate degree in science, plus my western herbalism education which includes anatomy, physiology, lots of biology and nutrition I believe in the scientific method and worked in the supplements department and herb stores too. I have deep passion and expertise in empowering people with the knowledge to take responsibility for their health and well being with the best guidance that both western and alternative medicine has to offer.
Everything about functional medicine, I have believed, I just didn't know how to learn or share this information.  I want to be able to assist people on their healthcare journey, empowering them to take care of their own health.
I'm a medical aesthetician and the spa director. My patients are typically mid 30's and up. I hear so many complaints from my patients. Women's issues that plague us all and that traditional medicine isn't helping us with. I want to offer my patients solutions. We are all so frustrated and tired of being tired (sore, cranky, hungry, not sleeping, moody, overwhelmed, no motivation...stuck! I want my patients to have beautiful skin and to feel energized and beautiful on the inside as well.
"I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s in my early 20s. Being a professional volleyball player for 15 years I didn't feel the effects of it so much, but I as constantly overtrained and eventually started feeling all the symptoms by the book. 
I have a T1D in my immediate family (my brother) and insulin resistance on my mother's side, so being diagnosed with subclinical autoimmune disease was eye opening. That's when I decided I need to learn more. I got certified in a UK college online program over 1 year to be a Certified Diet and Nutrition advisor and Certified Sports Nutritionist.
I believe in finding the root cause and even though I am currently working a 9-to-5 in Clinical Trials, I want to work with clients ans help them understand where their issue begin, rather than treat symptoms.
The reason I need this certification is I want to learn to interpret functional lab testing, understand supplements better ans be able to threat autoimmune, gut, mold issues and help heal people!
My motivation is my family - I want to quit my 9-to-5 and be able to provide foe them while having more free time for my 2 little kids (7 and 2 y.o.).
This is briefly my story."
I’m a WHNP ready to start something more meaningful
I'm a nurse over 20 years, exhausted shift working pattern, recently finished 3year acupuncturist course and working as part time, my clients do treat me, but deep down I think I still in a routine working mode for them, I wanna to know more to solve their concerns.
"Longtime, lifelong learner of wellness and health. I believe in evidence-based medicine and longevity wellness. I am a former certified Utah licensed Direct-Entry Midwife. I am currently working as a RN care manager for two western medicine ambulatory clinics with Intermountain Health in Provo, Utah area. I work with 80 clients to help them live their ""healthiest lives possible."" I am often at conflict with outdated medicine practices and want to start my own functional medicine practice with my own clients, to help them get accurate, timely, research driven education about how their lifestyle choices can affect their quality of life."
I have been in the industry for 4 years and I'm a certified master herbalist. I have a company called Root & Rise where we focus on root cause health issues. Looking to broaden my horizons and help those that are suffering.
I love holistic health and this will assist me in my journey
"I have been attracted to natural healing my entire life due to my grandmother teaching me how to use plants, make tinctures, salves ever since I was a child. It has led me to a pass of self healing and a consistent search for knowledge that never rests.
In 1996 I got involved in a company that produces and sold a simple device that makes it simple to produce a fermented milk product called Kefir, right on the kitchen bench.
At the same time I was exposed to the disability field through a Quadriplegic friend and received certification after attending a 12-month course. 
This resulted in working for 18 years providing disability support to a broad spectrum of clients for about 3 years, but then specialising in mental health field.
I left the disability field to explore new opportunities and take a well deserved break. 
I have since explored fields in online marketing, coaching, AI, cryptocurrency, health and wellness, technical analysis....
I came across your advertisement and it instantly resonated with me since I was looking for a way to make a real difference to other people's life while providing me with a purpose for my existence."
Working as a practicing GI physician- interested in adding functional medicine component to my practice.
I’ve been studying quantum physics and holistic modalities on my own journey for the last 9 years. Breathwork, Ayurveda, somatic healing and intuitive healing, NLP, Silva Method certifications are all in my toolkit. I’ve been in real estate for 20 years, speaking and teaching other agents to build big businesses and they’re all miserable so I recently shifted to coach those leaders into mind body spirit holistic wellness for business mastery.
I have taken multiple functional and integrative medicine courses and I would love to learn more! I am truly interested in discovering the root cause of my patients’ symptoms and helping them truly get bettter!

I'm an RN and worked in a naturopath center for almost 10 years. I want to learn more about functional medicine
I became interested in alternative treatment methods after a nightmare situation at a hospital.  Since then, I have accumulated more diagnoses, most of which stem from that hospital stay, in my opinion.  I have been searching for answers for myself for years, and I had an idea of a product I wanted to create.  However, I thought I needed the foundational knowledge first, so that brought me here.
I've been a nurse for over 28 years, currently working in a Neuro/Trauma ICU on the weekends. I switched to weekends 2 years ago when my grandson was born, so I could keep him during the weekdays for my daughter. I enjoy nursing, but at 57 I'm ready to step away from bedside. I recently graduated (this month) from a nurse coach program with the goal that I could continue to care for people ,just in a different manner. I decided to take this course to add more opportunity to the coaching business I'm working to get going.
"In 2010, I was on half duty days and very sick.  I retired from the military after 23 yrs and began retirement surfing the couch to the bed.  Conventional meds kept failing, so I turned to natural remedies.  First CBD, the EOs, herbs and finally Frequency healing.

I am better than I have been in years.  I’m not cured but I am back to living a decent life.  I am a healer and want to learn as much as possible.  I look forward to diving in."

I’m a BCPA, RCP helping patients and clients navigate their healthcare journey. I work with many functional medicine physicians and believe this certification will help me better assist my patients and clients.
"I'm a Registered Dietitian who left working in healthcare 3.5 years ago, after my frustration over the horrible way all was treated during the ""C"" pandemic.  I'm a firm believer in empowering patients to change through diet and lifestyle, but found most of the patients I was assigned to work with were quite comfortable simply leaving their health in the hands of their doctors, and were not very interested in making the necessary diet and lifestyle changes.  I do need to bring in that lost income and have always wanted to be self-employed, and have not been able to succeed in this goal in the past, but I feel that with all your program offers, this may be the path I can follow to achieve my goals.  I'm also dealing with my own health problems that the providers I have consulted don't seem to be able to resolve, & hopefully, I can learn what is needed to fix myself, too."
I'm a LPC and want to expand my services.
I have been guided by divine intelligence and so grateful that your ad popped up on my feed. I really enjoy helping people and I know western medicine has decided to not help heal people.  Unfortunate for the people the practice of medicine is a money pit.  Profiting off of people‘s pain. I really want to help and I think this is a wonderful pool of knowledge to start  my journey.
I suffer from multiple chronic health conditions. I am on a lot of meds and I am still unwell. I have lived pay check to pay check and have worked 2 jobs. I have had what people consider a couple of good jobs but in toxic environments that caused more health issues. I rarely took off from work and worked sick or well. Sacrificed a lot with no appreciation or respect. I just recently, very unexpectedly lost my job and medical insurance. That is beyond stressful and life-changing. I will not let it define me or cause me to fail at what I need to do, including helping others. I must keep moving for myself and my family, no matter how bad this feels, no matter how worried I am. I always have and always will do something meaningful as a career or my own business.

This is a purchase for my spouse, to help her find ways to heal herself and be a testament to help others.
I’ve been studying holistic root cause medicine for the last 3 years, via books, online, and even doing protocols on myself. I have helped many friends and family with their health issues, and some strangers as well. I want to become certified so I can learn even more and actually turn my passion into a career.
I have thyroid issues and struggle with my weight. My doctor patiently helps me manage my medication and supports me in keeping my weight in check. She listens to all my concerns and actively involves me in my care plan, which makes a big difference. I feel healthier and more confident. I want to help other women feel good the way my doctor helped me feel better.
It seems like a place where the basics of functional medicine has been gathered
My own health issues and I am currently working with a health coach and I want to be able to help myself as well as others. I am VERY interested in the root issues and protocols. My current profession is an over the road truck driver and I miss out on time with my family and loved ones.
25 years ago I became allergic to a pharmaceutical drug and nearly lost my life. Fast forward - it took me on a path of holistic modalities to heal myself which led to my passion of helping others so they never have to experience what I went through that took 10 years to heal! I went to school and became a Board Certified Holistic Health Practitioner and a Licensed Massage Therapist specializing in medical massage. I already have an understanding of the gut and the human microbiome. I'd like to have a deeper understanding of complex autoimmune issues and to get to the root problem so it can be resolved for my clients. I'm sure when we speak, you will get a better understanding.
It’s something I’ve wanted to do for myself and potentially build a business with.
I had a healing journey myself and want to coach others through theirs
"Dear Sara,

My name is Ibrahim Naser, and I’m truly excited to join your functional medicine course. Let me share a little bit about my background so you have a sense of the journey that brought me here.

I graduated as a pharmacist in Egypt back in 2005. Shortly after, I worked as a sales representative for Merck Sharp & Dohme, focusing on high blood pressure medications until around 2007. I then spent five years in Saudi Arabia working with AstraZeneca before moving to the United States.

In the U.S., I earned my pharmacist license in 2016. My experience here has been quite diverse: I started in retail pharmacy, then moved into home infusion pharmacy, eventually becoming a pharmacy manager and pharmacist-in-charge. I even worked in the hospital setting at West Hills Hospital (now part of UCLA), where I dealt with ICU, ER, labor and delivery, and NICU cases.

I then joined Option Care, the largest home infusion pharmacy network in the U.S., for five years. After that, I transitioned into working as a transplant pharmacist with Biometrix Pharmacy, helping patients through complex transplant regimens.

Eventually, I founded my own company, Kaya Pharmaceuticals, an online venture focused on vitamins and supplements. While it’s been a successful journey, it made me realize I needed deeper expertise in the functional medicine side of things—especially as I plan to open a retail wellness store and even expand into non-sterile compounding like hormone replacement therapies.

In short, I’m here to bridge that gap. I want to be the pharmacist who not only dispenses but truly understands the supplements I recommend. By completing your course, I’ll be able to offer my customers something unique: a pharmacist-led, functional medicine approach to wellness.

Thank you for the opportunity to learn and grow with you. I’m looking forward to this journey."

"I have been studying and using integrative practices since the age of 14
 I have changed from nursing to massage,  built a practice, developed my own modality and learned so many things through my own struggles with wellness. I have knowledge but not the accredited kind. I'm a natural teacher,  I have the opportunity to start teaching through wellness retreats and I want more knowledge and the backing people look for from an accredited institution. The big plan for my practice is not just a massage practice but a wellness center."
"Im an oncology nurse. I help a lot of people. It seems natural to me to give the right advise, explain things clearly, give insight or simply say the right words to someone. I was exploring weather pursuing a psychology degree and offering holistic nursing to oncology patients would be enough, but I dont thing so. I help everyone. I see both side of the coin. I bring calm to a lot of stormy situations. Im bold enough to speak out when everyone else is holding back.  In this light, I explored coaching and Counselling. I found coaching is more my thing. I stumbled on your offer when I was looking for some sort of training to start me off. I told myself I was ready to start, so your offer came just when I needed it. 

I had been searching the internet for something that would give me enough knowledge and suit my pocket. I have a lot of responsibilities. I have children in school an elderly mother and sister to look after. So my nurse's salary is overstreatched as it is. When you offered this black friday deal, I knew this was it. 

Lastly, when I get to know how to enterprate those lab results, I will be a notch ahead of my colleagues, 😂 😆 😂 😆 😂. 

So thats my story."
I am a nutritionist. My background is that I work in public health at the Wic program for over 25 years. As much as I enjoy working with women and children and I find the daily grind is impossible. You really can’t council people in 15 minutes and we’re just getting busier and busier. I don’t believe in a lot of the recommendations at the USDA has For health and nutrition. I also want more balance in my life and fair payment for work that I do.
I’m a home health and hospice nurse, who keeps seeing patients getting worse and worse and die, and feel helpless. I feel there is much more to offer them.
"Hi, I am a 46 year old chef. I am a born South African, living in Germany for 20 years. I moved to the Netherlands a year ago. I have been dreaming of leaving the kitchen for years now, but I didn't know in which direction I wanted to go. I did a course in orthomolecular nutrition, which gave me amazing knowledge.

I am getting to old be slaving in the kitchen, and the love is just not there anymore. I have been searching for months now on options of a career change. I was really getting overwhelmed by all the options online, and then, if by godsend, I saw your course. I didn`t enroll immediately,(I saw the ad on Monday), but I woke up every morning, until yesterday, and I could not stop thinking about it."

I’m an RN, working in ER. I got sick about 6 yrs ago and no one knew how to help me. This led me to go down the natural medicine route. I researched and got myself half way back to normal. I’d like to figure the other half out and also help others ..which has always been my desire. I love helping
I want to create real solutions for patients and stop putting bandaids on bullet wounds.
For my patients and better results
I have been a nurse for 35 years. I just changed overtime so I feel like this is an opportunity to refresh my understanding. I am also raising my four year-old grandson. I want to have the opportunity to improve my own house, safeguard him by having the opportunity to arrange my own time and availability to his needs.
To help people
I have suffered Hashimotos for 25 years. No doctor is able to properly treat it not to mention the side affects of having this illness. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, constipation, pain, insomnia & weight gain
I have been a nurse for 30 years and I recently became certified as a Nurse Coach. I plan to use the certification full-time within the next year or two and I want to focus on integrated and functional medicine with my approach. I’m super excited for this opportunity and journey!
A few years ago I took miscellaneous courses through another platform, but hardly any of them were accredited. When it came time to open my practice, I felt underprepared and like I didn’t have what I needed to really support people. This seems different, and like the piece I was missing.
I've always been an advocate of holistic health and medicine. I have 25 plus years in the health and fitness industry and I'm a certified health coach. I work in healthcare but find that it doesn't fulfill what I believe as my soul's purpose
I'm a nurse, and a mother of four children. I want to spend more time with my children, but I can't afford life if I work only one job. I start to have two jobs 12 hours shift. No time with my kids. I am looking for work that doesn't consume all of my 24 hours. Hopefully, you understand what I meant. Life is expensive this day, and be proactive is essential. I am in school as well to earn advanced nursing degree. Just a year left two get my NP degree. I am thinking that having a functional medicine certification open more doors and strength my future practice.
"I’m currently 52 years old. At the age of 44 I went from no health conditions and feeling relatively healthy( except for being overweight) to being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Two years later (2/2020 to be exact) I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.  What a crazy time in this world to be diagnosed with another autoimmune disease as I am also a practicing Respiratory of Therapist of 31 years.   
I have been on a quest to find my own healing through natural remedies and trying to eliminate some of the crazy medications and side effects that come along with them. I have fallen in love with my herbs and tinctures and enjoy helping family members with issues. 
In my outpatient world at the hospital doing Pulmonary Function Testing 2 days a week, I meet so many amazing people and hear their stories and struggles in our current medical environment and know there’s a huge void of what is available. I’d love to help others like me as well as utilize my knowledge of respiratory issues to help people in that struggle as well."
I’ve been a health coach for 3 years and I want a greater depth of lab testing. I was in the process of partnering with a functional medicine doctor but I’d prefer to be able to rely on myself.
I want to better understand treatments for chronic Lyme disease, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mold toxicity.
I am a Holistic Health Practitioner and passionate steward of a 1/4 acre intensive homestead. I raise meat rabbits and Coturnix quail, practice hyper-efficient raised-bed gardening, and preserve every harvest through canning, freeze-drying, and crafting powerful herbal oils and tinctures. My mission is two-fold: to empower aspiring homesteaders to achieve true backyard sustainability, and to certify the next generation of wellness professionals through accredited courses.
I am a nurse and I’m looking to shift into something more fulfilling.
I’ve gone through health issues myself and holistic care is what changed my life.  I want to give back and have a business helping others heal
I’ve been an aesthetics nurse for 17 years. I own my own practice in California and Aesthetics is quickly changing into Aesthetics and Wellness. I’m interested in bringing in Wellness and functional medicine into my practice but only after I have completed certification.
I have been interested in functional medicine for years.  I am a Registered Nurse and saw very quickly the way Covid was handled was completely wrong.  I am a homeschooling mom and would like to use my medical knowledge along with this functional medicine certificate to help people stay out of the sick care model, off of many unnecessary medications, and truly get well.
I work with older people on a daily basis in organizing from organizing their homes to their businesses to their lives, and their health is what really keeps him behind, and I’ve worked with some of my clients, and got them back into somewhat of a regiment of working out walking swimming going to the strong or get them stronger so they can live out their last days in a healthy manner instead of in a nursing home, and I feel that this will take my business to the next level
I want to learn more about integrative and functional medicine to help myself and others. I am already a certified health coach.
Just want to learn more about my health
I’m a nurse practitioner and owner of a primary care clinic with certifications in family medicine and psychiatry. I love my practice and patients but not the medical system. I’d like to expand into the functional side of patient care.
I have completed other programs and thought thus was a great addition to my knowledge base. I am a Yoga Instructor,  Personal Trainer,  and Integrative Nutrition Health Coach always looking to learn more. I just had my own labs completed and thought it would be cool to use them as I learn here.
I’m an RN looking for an alternate career.
I personally have always had a passion for health & wellness. I have my personal training certification and I worked as a health engagement consultant for a major healthcare company. I moved into management of engagement consultants in 2021 and in 2025 due to a reorganization, my role was eliminated. I am still work within the healthcare company but in a sales role. My passion has dwindled. Going through my personal perimenopause journey has inspired me to help other women sift through the complicated world of healthcare. The truth is western medicine has failed us as women in this country. I have personally dived into the world of natural remedies (specifically essential oils) and have seen some amazing progress. I am asked by friends and family constantly what I’m doing and what worked and I’m weary of giving them generic advice. I want to help them so much but want to have more specific knowledge of their personal conditions so I need the tools for that.
I am a RN who wants to help clients beyond medications. Pts come in with a problem and leave out with a prescription. We never determine the root cause of the problem, we just fix it with medications that the pts have to be on forever bc we simply did not take the time to figure out why the pt has HTN or DM2. I want to start my own business that really help individuals become their best self.
I will forever be a student.
I've been researching and thinking about this for months, wantingtoadd functional medicine to my nursing career experience. I've had a challenging life and was in peri-menopause for 8 years before my hysterectomy.
Love with passion to help people
I’m a cancer thriver. Wouldn’t it be great if we could fix the root causes of cancer before  their ever becomes a need for  diagnosis?
I am a Certified Personal Fitness Trainer and HTMA Practitioner and love all things Root Cause deep diving into things and not just offering bandaids to my clients health! As with all of us we all have our own health trauma stories but once I took control of my own journey it was the best fore me
I am the co-owner of a Health and Wellness center in Boston MA. My business partner is an APRN. I am looking to get more in depth knowledge of integrated and functional medicine as well as a holistic approach to our practice. I believe this course will help me achieve that goal.
I was scrolling FB found the sight, I was pushed out of my corporate job, but burnt out anyhow don’t was ok but the timing not to my liking nor the method in which it occurred.  I’ve always liked health since giving a presentation on reproductive health in the 5th grade.  Yes 5th grade.  I was pursing entrance to get the exams for becoming a medical doctor, but my first husband never supported that so I gave my study books away to my coworker for his daughters and I put that dream on the shelf. I finished my time in military service. Then I got certified and Education and began teaching for several years, but found that there was the Political side of teaching that didn’t sit with me well so I went back to Contract work, and this is where the burnout began. I had taken several holistic health courses and even trained at a school program and became an herbalist which I do love. However, there are still some things missing like getting a confident Herbalist to show you how to read lab work.  This and having explored other integrative health programs that are out of my financial reach now I thought I would explore your course. I’m currently taking a study at home Herbalist course because I always keep my hands in mind and herbalism. I hope that I can complete your program and my Herbalist program. I hope that I can help people truly suffering from not understanding what is causing their health decline while earning income to sustain a modest lifestyle of my own.
I’ma practitioner already and want to have more knowledge about functional medicine
I do massage on the side because I love helping people. I’m a believer in natural medicine. I know so many struggling with overall health issues that they just get prescribed RX after RX and can’t ever seem to find relief. I’d love to be able to help people get to the root cause of their issues.
To advance my knowledge in a multitude of areas to better care for my clients at my wellness clinic
Want to further my knowledge of the mind body connection
I’d have been in the health and wellness industry for 17 years, always in the background putting together the education programs. Now, I own a supplement company and it’s time for me to level up my knowledge. My dream was always to become a doctor but my path took me another way and how I learn and what I learned brought me here.
Want information for my own health.
Been looking for this training but priced out
I am a physical therapist with a specialization in pelvic floor health and I have been practicing for 20 years. I have had my own private practice for 10 years and I employ 6 physical therapists on my staff. I have developed the ability to successfully address complex pelvic pain and pelvic floor dysfunctions well but I almost always end up circling back to some underlying issues with my patients (hormone, gut health, autoimmune) that I just don’t feel qualified to address and that I truly feel our traditional healthcare providers are also not addressing fully. Additionally, I am currently going through perimenopause myself and I feel like my traditional healthcare providers just are not listening to me or adequately prepared to help address some of my own symptoms. I have a passion for learning and I want to also personally benefit from the information I can learn in this certification program as well as use it to help others.
For me it's the need to gain more useful knowledge that I know will be needed in my life and my family's life. Then maybe down the road I can do this as a business.
My partner and I already live this life!  We want to officially help others!
I have been a cardiology nurse practitioner for 25 years. I enjoy helping my patients. Each year, it seems that medicine is becoming more and more about generating revenue and less and less about caring for patients. I find myself trying to help solve patient problems that are outside of my specialty because nobody takes the time to listen to them. This often results in working late to complete documentation leading to overwhelm and burnout. I refuse to sacrifice the quality of my interactions with my patients, however my current situation is not really sustainable if I want to provide the care I believe every patient deserves. I know something needs to change and I am hopeful that this path will permit me to practice medicine without compromise and simultaneously find work-life balance.
I’m personally have thyroid disease for over 20 years. Struggled with weight loss and inflammation. As a nurse practitioner, I have gravitated towards functional medicine approach towards health and how to heal my patients but don’t have the full knowledge and capacity to practice in the space. I’m glad to find something that gives me the functional medicine knowledge at an affordable price.
I’m trying to break free from the corporate world and starting my own remote/ virtual pharmacy consulting business
I need continue education hours for my occupational therapy license and I own a biohacking facility where I do life coaching, and health coaching with a lot of people who are not well. I want to do better.
I am 10+ years out from breast cancer. While undergoing treatment at the Mayo, I did a lot of research on wholistic and integrative practices as complementary medicine. I felt it served a greater purpose than the terrible chemo and radiation paths and helped a great deal to get through it all and recover. Others watched me and supported me well and since then I am often asked to support others but do not have a foundation other than my own experience. I want to help others in a more educated way.
I have always been drawn to more natural and holistic ways of living and healing
I started with a direct sales company 5 years ago (Plexus) for the health of my husband and I.  We have both worked hard to achieve our health goals, but I have found that I do not have the knowledge to help my clients that deal with complex health issues through the same path.  I research a lot before I make health decisions for myself, and I feel that this will give me the knowledge I need to be confident in my own health decisions as well as those of my clients.
Looking for certified credibility to work with what I’m already doing
Additional education to further develop my patient service skills. New information and reminders I may have forgotten along the way.
I need a certified reputation in order to better attract clientele
Practicing optometrist for over 30 years, see many hurting people that I would like to be more knowledgeable about how I could help them.
Always improve
My personal life experience with chronic health issues has been very challenging! The traditional medical system has not been working for me and so many others that I speak with on a daily basis. So many of us are operating on 40% capacity on a daily basis!  I want to be able to help my family and one day help others to live life at full potential which will ultimately create healthier communities!
I have been a student of health since I was 23 when I learned about the effect of food water and air on our bodies. I am always encouraging people by my healthy lifestyle and give tips of what I do freely. My mom currently is in hospice at home and requires 24/7 care, my dad and I take care of her… this is the most difficult thing to experience and I want to help people fix the root of health problems rather than have to go through this!
I want to help caregivers with their loved ones suffering from Alzheimer’s and those who want to prevent the disease do so as well. I want to integrate functional medicine skills with my skills as a pharmacist and help people heal and then experience peace and empowerment.
Always interested in health
I am an uninspired Diet and Nutrtional Advisor and Menopause Champion….. I got ill and off kilter myself and lost my confidence …so I stopped coaching …this put a fire in my belly and also,  I have managed to work out how to help myself so starting to feel better and more optimistic 😊

I’ve been a chiropractor for years and have really started diving into the functional medicine ring over the last couple of years and your course came across at a time when I was ready to take a leap. Excited to see what all is available and learn from you!
Deeper knowledge
"So, partly it is a matter of personal learning for personal health and my daughter's health (she's 20 years old). I've struggled most of my life with Hashimoto's. Then came celiac and a soy allergy. Then dairy intolerance. My weight at one time was as high as 265 lbs before I stopped weighing myself; I have no idea where I truly topped out. (Weirdly, menopause seems to have put my body on an almost autopilot weight loss and I am down to 190.)  I have ADHD, and so does my daughter. She also struggles with the same celiac/soy/dairy issues, anxiety attacks, and has regularly recurring migraines that doctors cannot find the cause of.  
I have been wandering through different bits and pieces of natural, allopathic, fad, and functional healing for decades. From every imaginable supplement to various diets, herbals, essential oils, hydrogen water, adaptogenics, hypnosis, acupuncture, reiki, CBT, you name it. When this opportunity appeared, it felt like exactly the right time to really dig in from a more informed, organized point. I am also looking at new income opportunities, and coaching appeals to my teacher side without the headaches of school administrators and helicopter parents.  (And while I loved teaching teenagers, teaching adults is even more satisfying, so that fits too.)  
I'm a 'jill-of-all-trades' in some ways, having worked in IT, banking, telemarketing, printing, retail, and various grocery roles, including bakery and deli clerk. As for what I have done as a self-employed contractor within my LLC, I've done direct sales, photo inspections, face painting, phone customer support from home for financial software products, and been a mobile notary. 
I also write and am about to publish my first book about dealing with adult ADHD. Future books in the works are about herbal remedies to help with ADHD, and essential oils and other alternative therapies for ADHD. Right before I found this course, I decided the next book after those two would be a beginner's guide to demystify functional medicine. My theory was that the research for myself could be the basis for much of that book. 
What really appealed to me is that I have lifetime access to this program. I sometimes just get too burned out on the two 'main' jobs I currently have (deli clerk and phone support agent) or on assisting my daughter, so I can't do anything more, and the ability to take a break as needed is important to me. For example, the day after I signed up for this, my daughter called from college to say that she was taking (at the 'strong recommendation' of the school) a medical leave of absence and coming home. Getting her moved back, trying to get a therapist, doctor visits with her neurologist for migraines, it takes a lot of time."
I have worked in the healthcare industry my whole life, i started out as a CNA worked my way up to a practicing AGNP. I love what i do, i really do. I am learning more that what a provider is taught in school to help a patient, really might not be helping just placing a band-aid. Here is the part about me that i don't like.  I go out everyday and treat my patients the way i was trained, but at home i do the complete opposite for my family. Why, one would ask. I know and see the side effects of medication on a daily bases. You know here is a pill for this problem, but now because you take this pill i have to give you another because the pill your taking has now caused this problem. At home I study and find homeopathic ways to treat my family. The studying really hit home almost 2 years ago and the hunt is strong. My husband had a massive Hemorrhagic stroke, January of 2024. The stroke left him unable to speak, unable to use his  Right arm and half movement of his right leg. This i believe only because i didn't give up and pushed for him. He was in therapy for over a year, 5 days a week. Then ran out of insurance. I started him on a Lions main 6 months ago, which i started as well. I found this product studying and reading and learning about the brain. To say the least, i felt great taking it, My thought where clearer. My husband, i noticed increased activities that he was unable to do was now able and continues to do. Simple things like getting dressed on his own was challenging for him. To have a sock in your hand and know where is goes but couldn't seem to complete the task without being shown. It was like he knew step A and C but step B is not computing in his brain. The Healing of the nerves are also noticed as i have been able to wean down a common nerve medication given to stroke patient, to just 1 pill a day from 3 pills a day and sometimes having to also give him controlled level drugs. So you ask why and how i got here. Because i wanna give the same care to my clients/patients that i give to my family.
Always looking for better ways of living and sharing with others
"My story is long and woven into nearly every part of my life. I have been in and out of hospitals since I was nine years old, often spending entire years in medical settings and at multiple Mayo Clinics. Recently, I finally received diagnoses that make sense of decades of suffering: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, POTS, MCAS, and small fiber neuropathy, each with its own complicated, often debilitating ripple effects.
Even so, I have built a meaningful life as an LCSW. I support people through the hardest and most complex parts of their lives every single day. My work gives me purpose, even on the days when I can barely move, when pain takes over, or when I am leaving one appointment only to go to another. I take enormous pride in what I do because helping people feel seen and understood has always been the heartbeat of my life.
I am also a mother to two young girls who are my entire world. They are the reason I fight so hard for answers, and the reason I want to stay as healthy and present as I can. They deserve a mother who feels well and strong, and I want to show them that even in the hardest moments, we can choose curiosity, resilience, and hope.
Despite having a concierge physician, I currently have twenty-one specialists, endless testing, and no real answers. My labs are “normal,” but my life is not. I am down to ninety-two pounds. I cannot tolerate food without swelling or vomiting. I have violent allergic reactions while simultaneously testing negative for allergies. I spend hours every day coordinating my own care because I have no choice but to be my own quarterback.
And still, nothing adds up. The picture is incomplete. My doctors do not know how to treat me, and they openly say there is more going on that they cannot yet identify. I am living in the space between what they can measure and what my body is actually experiencing. That space is where people fall through the cracks, and where I refuse to stay.
That is what brought me here.
Functional medicine feels right in my heart because I believe deeply in getting to the root, not dismissing symptoms, not handing someone another referral, not treating patients as puzzles too complicated to solve. My chronic illness journey has reshaped the way I understand health, trauma, resilience, and the connection between the body, the nervous system, and the psyche.
I want to learn how to better support myself, and I want to redirect my wellness and chronic illness coaching skills, alongside my clinical background as an LCSW, toward helping people who feel lost in the medical maze, just as I have for most of my life. I want to help people find answers, empowerment, and a path back to themselves.
This certification is not just another credential. It is a step toward reclaiming my own health and becoming the kind of practitioner I wish I had met years ago. It is aligned with everything I value, including depth, curiosity, compassion, science, and the belief that people deserve comprehensive, root-cause-oriented care.
Functional medicine feels like home to everything I have lived through, and everything I hope to bring into the world, both for myself and for the two little girls who are watching me."
I’m in a pivotal moment in my life. I’m delving into my own health journey. And also stepping into my own intuitive coaching business, after 25yrs of massage therapy. I will still be massaging, but am feeling called to do more and be more. I’ve stifled this for far too long.
Always learning better living
Enjoy helping people.  Need a change from current career.
Increase Functional Knowledge
My degree is in education and I taught special education for 7 years. Burned out QUICKLY! During that time I started a family. My first son was diagnosed with ADHD in 1st grade. My second son was born 22 months later with 5 heart defects and died at 2 1/2 months old. 22 months later my 3rd son was born with chronic acid reflux so bad his stools were so acidic I couldn’t change him fast enough that he’d have blood dripping down his bottom and screaming bloody murder and stuff as a board. Our pediatrician wouldn’t treat him so I went to someone else who just gave him antacids. My 4th came 22 months later and was a girl. She was healthy. But I’d already started researching things on my own as far as the problems with our food industry and implemented changes to help my 2 boys. I became a stay at home mom looking for answers. Went all sorts of specialists and got same answers. So I looked outside standard medical care and those were the things that worked. I did find a doctor who specialized in “nerve hyperactivity disorders “ and the treatments changed our lives. With his help I opened up a treatment center, hired a medical director but closed it after 5 yrs because the docs we had wouldn’t follow protocols and I couldn’t force them. After that I got my certification as an integrative health coach. My dad died, left me some money, lady five yrs took care of my mom and aunt. They recently died so I’m hoping to get refreshed and expand my knowledge and see if I can bring in an income.
"In 2017, everything I thought I knew about “health” came crashing down.

I had been working in the health and fitness industry for over a decade. I owned a studio, taught classes every week, ate “clean,” and lived by all the mantras we were taught to repeat:
💥 Never miss a Monday
💥 No pain, no gain
💥 Go hard or go home

On the outside, I looked like the picture of health.
Inside? My body was waving every red flag it could.

After a traumatic year in and out of the hospital with my son, years of chronic stress, overtraining, and ignoring the warning signs finally hit me like a brick wall. I crashed—hard. First with shingles… then with an autoimmune thyroid diagnosis.

And when I reached out for help?
I was told:
“Your numbers are normal. There’s nothing you can do. Just wait until you need medication.”

I called BS. 🙅‍♀️

That moment became the catalyst for everything I believe in today.

I refused to accept the idea that the only option was to wait until I was sick enough for medication.
So I dove headfirst into root-cause health, functional medicine principles, and natural healing.

I read the books.
Listened to the podcasts.
Studied the research.
Sought out every resource I could find.

I changed my nutrition, restored my gut health, rewired my stress response, supported my hormones, optimized sleep, and used targeted supplementation—not band-aid medications.

✨ Nearly 10 years later, I’ve healed my thyroid naturally.
✨ I’m symptom-free.
✨ I’m in the best shape—physically, mentally, and hormonally—of my life.

And that journey is exactly why I believe so deeply in functional medicine and regenerative therapies today.

Because when you take a root-cause approach…
When you focus on restoring the body instead of suppressing symptoms…
When you support the systems that heal you rather than mute the signals trying to protect you…

The body responds.
The body rebuilds.
The body knows how to heal.

Now, as a personal trainer, nutrition coach, and functional health specialist, I help women do the same by addressing the foundation—not just the surface:

✅ Weight training & movement to build strength from within
✅ Functional nutrition & targeted supplementation
✅ Lifestyle shifts to support hormones, digestion, metabolism & recovery
✅ Regenerative therapies that amplify healing rather than override it

Your body is not broken.
It’s asking to be heard.

Healing is possible—when you stop fighting your body and start working with it. 💛"
As a nurse, i feel i could use my skills much more wisely, than just dishing out medicines that aren't addressing the cause of their problems.
I’ve been a massage therapist since 2008 as my 2nd career. My first career was in the dental field as an assistant. I’m finding more and more of my clients asking about issues they are experiencing and the medical system not supporting their concerns.
I am just starting my masters in integrative medicine. I want to work as a functionial and integravie focusiong on women in midlife
I’m a full time bartender and part time hustler in many different fields. I own a women’s activewear brand called J Rose Elite, a vending machine business, I do retirement account planning, and a few other small things on the side. I love learning about homeopathic/hollistic remedies after going through many years of health struggles and waking up to the fact that our health care system doesn’t usually give us solutions, but bandaids. I love sharing my knowledge with my friends and social media following to help them live healthier, less toxic lives. I recently completed a Naturopathy course…the program gave a lot of information, but not much about how to put it to use to help people. I love that your program came with so many great tools to put the knowledge to work. I do so many things because my goal is to be able to have a family one day and be able to be home with them, raise them, and homeschool. I know this will never be possible with bartending and it’s not something I want to do forever, but the money allows me to chase my other goals for the time being.
I’ve taken some Kinergetics classes and want to combine it with functional medicine, health, wellness coaching.

Hello, I want sure that I should spend anymore money on more education but I really want to learn and improve in my knowledge. I also do not feel prepared in coaching others. I have credentials in coaching and health psychology but haven't done anything with it. I want to help others in their mental health and wellness but I lack confidence, structure and the ability to stay a business. I think I'm holding my self back. I also don't have alot of time to spend in a normal work day and so building my own business and schedule works be best.  Many things, trauma and experiences have happened in my life and I have learned and am still learning but what's most important is I want to help others in their journey of aging and life. It's not easy, supporting, guiding and counseling is really where my heart is leading me.
"Hi there! I landed in the health and wellness field 3 years ago after completing a Yoga Teacher Training. I felt so inspired by the health, nutrition, and lifestyle aspect that I decided to complete an Ayurvedic nutrition course. I didn't use this to coach others; I used it more for myself. 3 years later, I am burnt out on being solely a yoga teacher. I am also going back to school for biotechnology, but it lacks the warmth that I crave. I am not interested in lab work, I want to be with real patients. I know I would like to help people in a coaching manner. I already have a bachelor's degree in biomedical science, and so I have a background to support my experience. I know I am meant to help others nutritionally, functionally, and lifestyle-wise. I am nervous to start this because I am not confident that I can get a client base to support myself. I am also not confident in my experience because I don't have a masters or doctorate degree."
I read the description and feel like I’m already doing this unintentionally for friends and family so I might as well get certified! It will also give me a side part-time income while still being a mom
"God had a way to get across what I am supposed to do. I was told by a high school guidance counselor that I should become a nurse. I said no way. 

Since 1999, I have been my mother's ""nurse."" She has had several issues, and one of them is Crohn's, which she is still dealing with. 

I have been having issues, but I did not know what questions I should ask to get help. My doctor knows I have had chronic constipation, developed eczema, developed gluten sensitivity, and had a file on my tongue for a few years. This year I started with stomach pains in June. I did not go to the doctor. I ended up in the hospital for a partial intestinal obstruction a week after my mother got out of the hospital for the same. 

I was diagnosed with Crohn's. The GI Doctor told me I have to take IBD Med for life. I refused. I don't want to go through what my mother is going through with her IBD med and all the potential side effect and her GI doctor doesn’t do anything about it.

I had to figure out how to get ride of the pain myself. I was not given anything for the inflammation and never saw doctor until a month later. If I can figure out how to get the pain to go away, I can figure out how not to have to talk IBD Meds. I started working with a Functional Nutritionist a month ago and I can see the visible issue going away. I can’t what to go through the next 2 stages of the protocols.

I saw you ad on Facebook and decided I should start learning more and get certified so maybe me mother will take me seriously. If not, I hope to at least help people that want the help."
Disappointnent in conventional medicine
About 20 years ago, I was about 40 and taking tons of medication and they weren’t helping. I was sent to Mayo Clinic because my doctor thought I had MS.  They told me there was nothing wrong and told me I had anxiety and I should go see a psychiatrist when I got home. The psychiatrist said I just had ADD but asked if Mayo Clinic had fixed my problem. When I told him no and he gave me a subscription for a food supplement.  It was the first thing that ever helped. This made a light bulb go off that led me to essential oils. This journey helped me get rid of all of my medicine. I then started on a herbal path and have learned to use teas and make my own tinctures. Mullein has been great for my allergies/asthma. I am still learning more about these but it led me to this journey. I also am in the process of get my aromatherapy certification. My goal is to work on getting my knowledge and certifications so that when I retire I can work from home, set my hours and make a supplemental income for my retirement. I am even trying to grow some of my own herbs but my job makes it difficult to get a lot done and my passions many times end up on the back burner. I get overwhelmed and am afraid I am never going to accomplish these goals. If I could get them to fall in line I might even be able to retire early. I just hope I haven’t bitten off more than I can chew. 😊
I have been in the dental field for most of my life but we opened a spa with one of the massage therapists in our gym (my husband owns the gym, so we do) but I wanted to learn enough to not rely on another person so I became a Licensed Massage Therapist this year as well and found that I loved it more than I imagined I would and now am looking to incorporate every possible thing I can that integrates with my clients from the spa to the gym and improves their lives as well enriching my own.
I have utilized a wellness group and felt like a number and did not get the answers that I was looking for.  After the first assessment I felt like a cash cow for them.  I am very interested in root causes.
I am currently at Dr. Sea’s health coach and have looked into other courses, but they require different certifications to participate. I am also a massage therapist, certified lymphedema, therapist, and licensed aesthetician, but I want to move more into wellness coaching. I just need to figure out how to get paid for it because I do it with all my current clients This extra CERT Should help.
I’m a registered nurse and I have my BSN. I’ve worked in the nursing homes, hospice and the hospital in the psych department. It makes me sad that so many people are sick and I know they could be in better health if they just knew what to do and what not to do.  I personally use essential oils and alternative medicine and holistic practices to maintain my health. I want to help people be the best person they can be, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.
I have a passion for holistic health and am eager to learn as much as I can to help others
My passion is holistic health and  I am always eager to learn as much as I can to help others heal.
I am a Physician Assistant for >25 yrs. I have worked in ER, UC, IM, Family med and Geriatrics. I am tired of working for companies that exploit my hard work, intelligence and empathy.  I am tired of Allopathic medicine which completely disregards the basics of healthy food, natural remedies and lifestyle modifications. I yearn to take care of patients on a holistic level. I yearn to spend appropriate amount of time with patients. I yearn to make the amount of money I deserve. I want to have time and financial stability. I am going to make enough money one day so I may eventually open a free clinic for the underserved.
I do energy work, but I want to be able to get to the root cause of illness. I have my own health issue that western medicine hasn't been able to figure out. I want to be able to help others and myself when the medical system fails.
I am excited about the knowledge.
"I became a Family Nurse Practitioner in 2020 after working as a Registered Nurse for 30 years. I now run my own clinic and take a holistic approach to patient care. I offer a wide range of supplements, perform extensive methylation testing, and support patients with healthy weight-loss programs.

I haven’t done any advertising, yet I’ve built a patient base of about 400 patients, most of whom were referred by others. Through this program, I hope to gain deeper insights into identifying and addressing root causes for my patients."
I am 47 years old, in the trenches of perimenopause, a divorce after 23 years of marriage, struggling to raise my daughters and tired at a bone deep level. I work in an industry where the mental health and suicide rates are sky high, and the pay is not enough to be able to support myself let alone my kids. I feel awful physically and emotionally and even if I pick up a few tips to improve my and my daughters’ qualities of life then it will be worth it. If it brings me to a place where I can help others that are suffering, so much the better.
I saw this online and I have been looking for a credible way to certify holistic health I was given for Pfizer vaccines and my health went so far down the drain. I refused to die so I spent my entire life savings on supplements and gimmick. Some things worked most things didn’t I pay for a monthly subscription to a frequency scanner that has helped me regain most of my health back I have held off on doing anything like this before because I wasn’t mentally able to function, but I know in my soul that I was sent here to suffer so I can help others. I really hope that this isn’t a gimmick. I screenshot it and saved all of your money back guarantees I’m really hoping that this works out. I did not like how every time I pass to page you’re telling me how I couldn’t live without your other expensive program. It might not be expensive to you, but someone who hasn’t worked and spent every penny trying to survive it’s very expensive. All of my bills are behind. I got in a car accident and can’t afford to fix my car so I am filling my heart, hoping that this is the right choice for me. I’m hoping that I can buy these later on once. I have made a profit. I’m a single mother to a wonderful six year-old little boy who is missing out on his mama and missing out on the world because we can’t afford anything at the moment. Almost everyone I know has a health condition and so many have died from random cancers and dropped dead from the vaccines. Almost all the woman in my life have hormone issues.
I am already a coach and integrative health is perfectly aligned to my integrated approach to personal development. It’s also something my wife and I care deeply about.
"I am RN, working as night shift for 23 years now. I am burnt out from stress from management and constant new changes and low census. I am also a mom of two busy children: one teen girl busy with school sports and church duties; one school-age boy with ADHD/autism diagnosis. I felt like I been ignoring and missing part of their lives. Now that my son is diagnosed with ADHD and autism I am needed at home more. I am also having debt from timeshare that I’m trying to exit. I tried another online business MLM that ended up adding up my debt instead of helping resolve my issue. I also have a daughter who has been having issue with cough over a year without resolving it by doctors. No antibiotics were helping. I also had increasing issue with sinus problems lately. I would love to take care of that issue as well."
I like it
Looking for more knowledge
Im committed people to heal all the days of my life why not add more tools to my modalities? The more I know the more I can help people that need healing! I can help people like no one ever tried or helped me. Let’s make it the world we want to live in!
My Day spa
Helping my existing clients with more
"My journey into functional health has been building for years, both personally and professionally. As a nurse practitioner, I’ve watched so many patients struggle with chronic symptoms that weren’t fully resolved by traditional, symptom-focused care. Over time, I found myself wanting a deeper understanding of root causes—nutrition, lifestyle, stress, sleep, hormones—and how they all connect.

At the same time, my own experiences with burnout, shifting health needs, and the desire to feel truly well pushed me to explore more integrative approaches in my own life. The more I learned, the more I felt called to support others in the same way.

Investing in this certification feels right because it aligns with the way I naturally approach care: whole-person, relationship-centered, curious, and compassionate. I’m here because I want to be the kind of provider who helps people heal from the inside out—not just manage symptoms, but reclaim their vitality. This path feels like the next step toward becoming the clinician, educator, and advocate I aspire to be."
I saw this and something stuck with me. As an RN, I find that we often just apply bandaids to real issues. We don’t address root causes of illness and throw treatments and medications at them that often exacerbate the underlying problems. I’m burnt out on bedside nursing. I don’t feel the satisfaction anymore. I don’t feel like I make a difference. And I don’t feel I’m compensated appropriately for the time, compassion, continuous education I engage in.
I want to learn how to interpret lab data. I have an auto immune condition and would like to learn as much as I can so I can heal myself and help others.
I’m tired of bedside nursing. I feel all we do is put bandages on problems and don’t get to the actual root causes. I don’t feel like I make a difference. I am not valued, appreciated, or adequately compensated for my knowledge and skills.
"I’ve been working in surgery for over 20 years and am ready to do something different and learn more. Have flexibility with my work schedule so I can be more present at home.

I'm a nurse who is looking to work for myself
Increase knowledge
I have been studying Holistic Nutrition for years, and recently obtained a Bachelors and Board Certification in the field, and now I'm trying to enrich my credentials to provide a more in-depth approach to my services.  I hope to someday establish a successfulHolistic wellness center which touches on the key aspects of health (mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, physiological).  A fuctional medicine credential, I feel, would be a major plus to the services I could provide to others on their wellness journey.
I own a wellness clinic. This will help me advance and be able to offer my clients more
"I am an intuitive healer…physical therapist who practices functional health with all my current patients. 

I would like to expand my knowledge to see what I can add to my practice. I thirst for natural healing remedies and hope this course can add to my current base."
I am an a board certified family physician with 20+ years of experience treating chronic medical conditions. My practice is mostly adult based and encompass a full spectrum of advanced medical conditions. I enjoy providing my patients with more integrative options in dealing with their medical conditions and I am looking forward to learning a more functional way of practicing and addressing challenging cases.
Need to find out how to help my clients on root cause
Not about the Cert - to be a better Steward
My son has ADHD, we have had no luck with mess and we saw a naturopath who put him on supplements and did the testing and nothing really seemed to help, I had breast cancer at age 28, and my husband has medical dx. I want to be able to help all of us (and others as well)

Vitamins saved my life as an infant when what the Doctors were telling my mother to do was not working. I was losing weight as a 5 month old baby girl. She was a member of the Mormon church and a church member gave her a book about vitamins and their relationship to health. She started putting the vitamins in my bottle and it reversed my weight loss. 57 years later, I am a Nurse Massage Therapist that helps people with muscle pain, anxiety and insomnia. I have used alternative methods to preserve my health my whole life. This will complement what I am already doing.

I want to add a more holistic approach to my current practice
my daughter got sick with ME/CFS
I am a Natrual Medicine PhD Candidate and Board Certified Holistic Health Practitioner that seeks to improve my skills with reading lab results, protocol development and clinical assessment.
"Over the last few years, my life has been a mix of deep challenges and deep awakening. Between walking through my own health struggles, supporting my family, and watching people I love feel unheard or dismissed, I slowly became the “go-to person” for friends who needed support, perspective, or a safe place to land. I didn’t plan on becoming that person—it just happened very naturally.

At the same time, my faith and my understanding of how the body, mind, and spirit connect has grown so much. I’ve seen how powerful it is when someone feels truly seen, listened to, and given tools that honor them as a whole person. That’s what pulled me toward this work in a serious way—not just as something I “do on the side,” but as part of my calling.

Investing in this certification felt like my next obedient step. It wasn’t just a business decision; it felt like alignment. I want to be equipped with solid training, structure, and credibility so I can ethically and confidently serve the people who are already being drawn to me. My heart is to help others find clarity, healing, and hope, and to do that in a way that is responsible, grounded, and excellent.

This certification represents more than a program to me—it’s a way to steward the gifts and experiences I’ve been given and turn them into something that can bless, support, and empower others on a much deeper level."
To help my clients at my spa business
I am a nurse practitioner who sees the need for functional medicine in our area. I want me o help people live their best, healthiest lives possible.
I am a pediatric occupational therapist. After years of working full time and raising a special needs child, I developed a cascade of health problems that resulted in multiple autoimmune disorders and unhealthy weight gain. Doctors only prescribed more medications and had no real advice on how to heal my body. This began my journey of healing through integrative wellness practices. I’m still learning, but I want to bring others with me along the journey.
I would like to learn more about integrative medicine
My daughter being vaccine injured and losing her hearing took me down a rabbit hole for functional medicine. I am a physical therapist by background. I am fond of alternative medicine.
The more I research the more I realized that Big Pharma doesn’t actually want to make anyone cured. Insurance companies and even physicians are often tied monetarily to pharmaceutical companies. I’d love to find root causes of health issues to help people to be well and to feel well without being misled or lied to.
More knowledge, I am a midwife
I’ve been interested in this for a while. I want to help others, especially friends and family
I am a 20 plus year Radiology Tech and the last two years I have worked as a Cardiovascular Invasive Specialist. I love what I do in healthcare. However, I feel the need to help people to get answers and heal with becoming stuck on medication. Many people I know suffer from ailments with no real answers or cures. Family members ask me for advice and I am limited in my knowledge so I go in Google searches to try to find answers. I would like to be a more valuable and credible source to all that reach out to me.
I already own an organic health and wellness company where I make my own tinctures, lotions and personal care products, so I’m just looking to add to my knowledge to help people in the right direction to heal their bodies as God intended.
I am a Certified Success and Life Coach.  I have been frustrated with the dysfunctional healthcare, or should I say “sick care” system we have in our country.  There’s just “treating” and no “healing”.  I am committed to becoming a healer.
I have been in the public health space since 1999. Although I love the work I have done, I am ready to go deeper in the functional medicine space. I am looking forward to how this course will help me provide more for the community.
I’m already planning an associates in nursing and I am very interested in hormones and autoimmune conditions
Injuries, perimenopause concerns, also want to help my clients more
I used to be a certified personal trainer and had a nutrition certification, about 20 years ago.  I’ve been interested in health and fitness for about 16 years.  I love given people advice on wellness, nutrition and fitness. Lately I’ve been dealing with a lot of gut issues and have been doing a lot research.  I want to learn more and also be able to have a side hustle for extra income.
I believe in functional medicine
"For a long time, my life has been shaped by two parallel paths—my own lived experience with PTSD and my desire to help others feel seen, supported, and whole. I served my country and came home with wounds that weren’t visible, yet affected every part of my life. Healing wasn’t a straight line—there were days filled with overwhelm, anxiety, and deep reflection—and yet, those moments taught me empathy, resilience, and the importance of compassionate care.

My journey is what led me here.

Dyvine Medical & Wellness was born from that same place—out of pain, growth, and a calling to create safe experiences for others. I wanted to build something that allowed people to feel cared for, not rushed. Heard, not dismissed. I know what it feels like to face invisible battles, and I want to be part of changing how people experience wellness and testing services. My certification felt like a natural next step—not just to expand my skillset, but to deepen the level of support, trust, and humanity I bring into my work.

Choosing this certification wasn’t just a career decision—it was heart-led. It felt like confirmation that my story, my struggles, and my healing all have purpose. I’m here because I believe in showing up for others the way I once needed someone to show up for me. And because every chapter of my life has guided me to serve, empower, and lead through compassion."
My son has an auto immune disease
Learn more about labs
I see patients often that are seeing functional medicine and talking about labs, that I don’t know about. Hormones are a puzzle. Mental health is tough. Just doing for a fuller understanding.
As a Nurse Practitioner, I’m interested in treating people at more of a depth than what we’ve been trained for. As a nurse, I want to be able to get to the root of the issues than telling people I can’t do anything.
I want to be accredited for something I have been offering for awhile
I just want to introduce your teacher into my existing coaching practice
I am a Certified Holistic Nutrition Practitioner and I want to go deeper in the areas you described.
"I’m a holistic body contouring and wellness practitioner with nearly two decades of experience helping people heal, feel confident, and reconnect with their bodies. My passion has always been combining beauty, wellness, and homeopathic methods to support the whole person—not just the symptoms.

Why I enrolled in a Functional Medicine Coach program:
I joined the program to deepen my understanding of the root causes behind weight issues, inflammation, hormonal imbalances, and post-op healing. I want to offer my clients a more integrative, science-based approach that blends everything I already do with deeper nutritional, lifestyle, and functional care—so they can experience true, long-term transformation from the inside out."
Self- discovery. Trying to figure out what doctors can’t. Husband is physician with functional medicine training. See the value
I am a professional counselor and neurofeedback/QEEG specialist, and I feel the integrated health piece is the perfect addition to my skill set. I see markers in clients' EEG that indicate metabolic issues, toxicity or nutrient issues and I want to know how to help them.
I've always been interested in health research , also my husband has been diagnosed with autoimmune disease and I'm not happy with doctor's approach.
I am an RN I have been working in integrative medicine the past two years. Treating Lyme, autoimmune, and mold pts through nutritional infusions and ozone treatments. I want to expand my degree into a new line of work helping people with the knowledge iv already gained and what I will learn in this course. To get to route nervous system deregulation and metabolic dysfunction. I find myself sharing knowledge and advice with pts for free as I monitor their therapies, many patients have told me I am so knowledgeable and would be a great coach. I’m hoping I can integrative these new certifications at my current integrative wellness center I work at and also my own private online business would be ideal to spend more time home with my daughter. Holistic medicine is something iv always been passionate about and since working in this line of medicine iv seen people actually start to heal their symptoms and have a higher quality of life. I feel I could help so many more individuals with the knowledge I learn in this course. Including my mother who currently has a mold illness and is trying different therapies that are not fully helping her. To be able to guide her better would also be a great gift.

I recently started a Skin Care line the focus on therapeutic products for skin issues such flares-ups for autoimmune diseases, eczema and psoriasis.  I’m diagnosed with Discoid Lupus and eczema and the Drs couldn’t prescribe me anything that worked for me.  I created all natural products that calms inflammatory skin and heal the symptoms
Hello Sara! I have had a wellness practice for 19 years now, I’m 51 and I learned about nutrition response testing from Freddie Ulan nearly 2 decades ago. I got into it because my husband had severe back pain that was causing seizures and no one could figure out what was going on. I have a masters in public health nutrition and I’m a registered dietitian but nothing in the hospital is helping him so I learned about some classes that Standard Process was offering and have never looked back. My husband died in a tragic rock climbing accident over seven years ago and I have since gotten remarried and moved to a small town in northern San Diego County. I still commute back to my practice in LA county but Only every six weeks and so I decided to open up a practice locally. I feel a little rusty as I had made leave in practicing every six weeks and so I thought that maybe a refresher course could be helpful to update my knowledge. I still only practice a couple of days a week because I’m managing a lot of kids now as well. I’m here to strengthen what I already know and learn more about what I don’t know. I’ve gone to many lectures on blood labs, but I still don’t feel super confident in that area. The product lines I use are Body Health, Standard Process, Biotics research, And a few others I post specific items from that I order on Emerson ecologics. I charge 175 for initials and 65 for follow ups and I like to see them every 3 to 4 weeks for a recheck. I have a business partner who manages the website and helps me with billing that I profit share with. I do muscle testing and mostly look for areas of pain or sensitivity in the body and muscle test for the cause and the solution, which I put in their hand until I find what combination makes the pain disappear. Sorry for being verbose, just wanted to be thorough with my background and what I’m looking to gain through your program. It sounds very promising. Thank you for the discounts, which made me click enroll!
Personal growth
Retired nurse practitioner who is not ready to retire-feel that doing complex cases and being my own boss is important. Just worried about finding patients -something that I have never done.
I lived in China for 2 years after graduating college and interviewed the locals  about how they were applying TCM concepts in every day food culture.  Then I returned to Colorado and started a catering incubator for immigrants.  After a few years of getting frustrated by the non profit world and food industry i shifted to health coaching for about a year.  Then I got pregnant in 2020 and now I have two beautiful children ages 2 and 4, and in just looking into relaunching a more targeted health coaching business.
I am browning into the person I was meant to be. I have a strong passion for helping people to become the best version of themselves. I live with autoimmune disease and have been able to keep it in remission for years just learning my body and myself and the art of natural medicine. I want to help others like me love a life full of joy not fear from a diagnosis, let people know they can live a long healthy life if they take time to invest in themselves and fill their world with the right knowledge.
A lot of my family members and I have health issues. I would like to learn about a more holistic approaches that may give us alternatives to treatments that we are currently undergoing.
I am entering a new  phase in life. I have a history in nursing but have been a stay at home mother for the last 7 years. I am creating a lifestyle brand from my experience in these areas and working on creating a magazine about health and wellness/ juicing lifestyle/ family wellness.
Ive been a personal trainer and aports nutritionist for 10 years but have always wanted to go deeper into nutrition ans really be able to guide people. Schooling is just too expensive.
My mother was a holistic wellness junkie so I grew up in it. I already help so many people, its time to put the certificate behind the advice. Also, I am having my own health challenges that I want to learn about. Mold exposure and hormonal imbalance.
What comes natural to me are interests of healing, learning, adjusting to life as we evolve.

I am your typical case where I was telling the doctors something was wrong, but always received the answers “well your labs all look perfect. You’re healthy as can be.” As I was struggling with major fatigue my entire high school year, Bradycardia, always sick. Then youn adulthood struck, and now I’m struggling with heart palpitations, random episodes of passing out. Finally got diagnosed with SVT, had an ablation, immediately after had POTS. Again doctors thought I was lying about my symptoms which were upon standing I was huffing and puffing, couldn’t breath, instantly got dizzy. I was in my early 20’s and couldn’t even walk to the bathroom from the couch without struggling or passing out. D I went to the hospital since it was happening just a few days after my ablation, performed the test wearing a BP Cuff and there was the evidence. Said they had never seen this before and transferred me to a bigger hospital. That’s when they diagnosed me with POTS and said me having my first baby 5 years ago is what caused it. They also informed me that there was no cure and I’d have this forever. They gave me a whole laundry list of all the things I couldn’t do now. Mind you, I was a collegiate athlete and one was not being able to exercise. Something didn’t sit right with me so I began researching. I took my heart meds still which did help but I was too young to be on medication for the rest of my life. I changed my diet, nourished my adrenals and within 2 years I was completely off my medication and didn’t have any symptoms. Fast forward to my 3rd baby - I just couldn’t lose the weight no matter what I did. But since my BMI was in range my docs refused to test my hormones. I just constantly felt puffy. Then I got pregnant with my 4th soon after and was the sickest I’d have ever been. It was absolutely miserable for everyone. Postpartum was also the worst. I had PPD/PPA SO BAD and the worst was my heart. My heart rate was dropping to the 30’s and I could feel it. My chest hurt and I was gasping for air like my body had forgotten to breathe. I was 8 weeks postpartum. Went to the ER they monitored me closely and saw what I was telling them. Transferred me to a bigger hospital with an amazing cardiology team. I was telling them I thought it was my thyroid but “everything looked fine” although come to find out I was .02 too high to meet their standards. The cardiologists ran every test on me they could and everything came back fine. Yet my heart rate was still dangerously low. They chalked it up to me being so healthy my heart didn’t need to beat as fast. I had the classic thyroid symptoms too. The hospital didn’t run a full thyroid test tone me but shortly after my primary did at my request. Again subclinical hypothyroidism and antibodies showed up but I was dismissed and said I was just so healthy. I took a thyroid class and dug in and within as month I was feeling better, my hr had came back up and I was feeling good again. Even started dropping some weight. That’s when I became a certified naturopathy practitioner, recently a BioEnergetic practitioner and really got into frequency medicine. I think functional medicine and frequencies are very complimentary and I’ve already been in business for a year and have had really good success. My next step is to quit my 9-5 job and focus on my business but I need to grow it some more before I can do that.
I am a natural Bodybuilder, health and wellness Coach and a functional nutrition practitioner. I’m always looking for leveling up my skills for not only myself but for my clients.
I am a former paramedic with multiple autoimmune problems and generally tired all the time with a lot of weight I have trouble losing. I would like to learn functional medicine so I can heal myself and use my story as inspiration for others. I can help them feel better, too.
Having thyroid issues personally, I have been the “it’s normal, you’re fine” patient. Turns out I wasn’t. Having a partial thyroidectomy confirmed a rare golf ball size tumor. My labs are still confusing and as a nurse I want more for my patients and myself.
I'm trained as an acupuncturist but not currently working as one. I am working full time but also trying to build out a healing center, and I want to offer multiple services particularly ones that go beyond one on one, in person (I can only help a few people this way). I also want to improve my personal health.
I am tired of seeing 50 patients a day.
Ive been a healer for a very long time
My family has gene mutations and thyroid issues.
Holistic medicine has always been my passion. I've battled with my own health issues for many years and functional medicine has always caught my eye. I'm looking to gain insight as well as help others.
I am looking forward to a career change and/or to add as a second income. I am intrigued to understand lab results better.
Trying to stay in wellness business without me doing the physical work
I’m an adult geriatric nurse practitioner, licensed for primary care but working as a hospitalist. I can’t stomach the AMA’s primary care model so I work in acute/emergency medicine. I know our healthcare is only reactionary at best and not preventative. The approach of mainstream healthcare does not promote health but rather compounds disease and symptoms by inhibiting our bodies’ natural ability to cleanse and heal. I want to offer my family and patients better care.
I have degrees in Holistic Nutrition and Exercise Physiology and enjoy learning as much as I can in the field of natural cures and treatments.
I already own a wellness company and run into roadblocks in certain illnesses and body systems.
"I am here because my entire journey in healthcare and ministry has pointed me toward this kind of work. I have been a registered nurse for over 25 years, a nurse educator, and now a board-certified Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. I also serve as a minister, walking with people through emotional, spiritual, and mental healing.

Even with all of my training, I kept seeing the same gap. People were struggling physically, mentally, and spiritually at the same time, and I wanted to understand how to support the whole person more fully. This certification felt like the right next step because it brings together everything I already do and deepens the way I can serve.

It felt right in my heart because it aligns with my calling. God has been leading me toward work that addresses the root causes of struggle and helps people heal in a complete and lasting way. This program helps me do that with greater clarity and confidence."
"MD physician 34 years of practice
  I believe in integrative care
      My goal is to become certified to be the best resource for my patients."
I have a love for holistic health that has me on a journey to practice a form of healing that integrates eastern and western healing.  I want to expand my knowledge so I can offer a fuller scope that it more informed and certified.
I am an bedside RN and the more I understand the better.
Registered nurse for 20 years, I have been interested in integrative and functional medicine for a decade now and would like to help people when I retire from nursing, have a second career/business. I want to be able to work from home and in different countries.
I've had a surgery (partial hysterectomy) over 13 years ago with ovaries remaining. From there my body has not brrn the same since its been tryinv to figure out what to do with the eggs they are still producing.
I want to understand functional medicine better.
I actually filled this questionnaire out but with my other email healthycoachja@gmail.com are you able to pull that form up?
Play 23 I lost my 23-year-old son to suicide after a 13 year battle with mental health issues relative to the loss of my mother with whom my son was extremely close on December 7, 2012, just one hour before I turned 40 years old. My life has been a journey in resilience building and trauma, and I have always just pushed through, but I am at a point in my life now where I realize I can’t just push through anymore. I need to really do a hard work of understanding my body and giving it love instead of abuse for the first time in my life, I have a calling to teach others how to cope with grief and to support them in processing trauma. I figure I didn’t go through all of this too leave this earth without what I have learned both good and bad that could be the guide for someone else. I’m here to regain my health regain strength to be more, loving both to myself to others and to help others be more loving to themselves as well.
lifetime study and dedication to health and wellness through healthy food and nutrition
I became interested in alternative medicine and healing about 10 years ago. For the past 35 years I have worked in the medical field as a Medical Lab Technician, Phlebotomist and then onto high level management positions. Also started working with surgery centers. Over these bunch of years I noticed the change in the medical practices and it's practitioners. It became all about money, time and a low level of care. Essentially, just $$$ on a conveyor belt giving prescriptions for everything.  I left the Medical field. I started researching alternative healing and happily live a life free of prescriptions and better living. I want to expand on that knowledge.
I am a nurse practitioner certified in Adult and Geriatric . I would to open my practice
I am interested in people getting better instead of prescribing medications for everything
Functional medicine
I have been working as an RN doing hospice for 18 years and I’ve always been interested in alternative health and would love to get my certificate so I can help myself and others be as healthy as possible
I’m a therapist living with an autoimmune disease. I often talk with clients about nutrition, supplements for mental health, and ways to address chronic pain but I have to be intentional not to exceed my scope of practice. With these certifications I would feel freedom to go more in-depth with my clients without practicing outside my degree and scope.
Wanting to use natural remedies to heal
I’m an RN in NP school but I have always been drawn to functional medicine. Wondering if this might be my next step
I want to use natural remedies to heal.
I have challenging health issues.
My health...my journey....I want to help others to find their wellbeing over all in a natural way possible .
I have been a nurse for 15 years and getting burned out. I have been wanting to start my own business helping people get healthy for a while. I thought I needed to start with a brick and mortar business. I already have an understanding of functional medicine approach through my own
My friend Lisa shared this with me. We are both Nurses. Personally I am getting physically burnt out and was praying for a way to help people but not physically with my body. Was so excited when she shared this with me. Because I would be utilizing some medical experience along with new knowledge the healthy natural way. Preventive way. I may have said this wrong but I hope it comes across right. I’m just so excited. Thank you. I look forward to growing and helping.
I’m interested in functional medicine and want to learn how to help people.
Curious
I have been hearing about functional medicine, and this is my opportunity to explore it, at an accelerated pace.
I am looking for a way to help others and to help myself be more healthy
I am an NP wanting to expand my knowledge and help people in ways outside of conventional medical practice

"The COVID-19 pandemic brought me here. I was a mother/baby nurse for a grant-funded program through a local health department. However, when needed, we were pulled to things like flu-shot drive through events which I enjoyed. However, when COVID hit, we were pulled to begin testing folks en masse. At first, it felt like I was part of something important. Then, as time went on, it felt like the medical community had lost it's collective mind. We knew masks didn't prevent the spread of viruses, yet we were now pretending they did? And since when in the history of our country did we invest so much into a ""vaccine"" for something with a 97% recovery rate? And why were we calling it a vaccine anyway? I felt trapped and I quit. But I missed nursing so much, I found a way back in through dialysis. I took an exemption and did not take the clot shot. And although I love what I do for the most part, I hate the sick-care model we are all trapped in. I watch people like Dr. Hyman and Dr. Josh Axe and I want to help people learn what I am learning. I want to homestead. I grind my own wheat and make sourdough from freshly milled flour. I want to truly eat clean and help others do the same. I am no longer on anything for migraine or depression. I only take supplements. There is currently no functional medicine doctor in my area of Texas, but I am hoping that once I get certified, my path will be clearer. I am afraid to be self-employed though"
"I created a veteran nonprofit 501 C3 to help my brothers and sisters in healing.

 GI Green is a Veteran-focused nonprofit organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for veterans through alternative and holistic healthcare. The organization emphasizes community building, education, and the use of legal cannabis and plant medicine as means to combat opioid addiction and improve mental health among veterans.

This is my life serving others. I will be giving services free of charge. It is a part of our program."
I have been in healthcare for going on 20yrs. The majority of my career has been focused in trauma and critical care. I'm tired. I'm tired of long hours, time lost with my family, and the constant extreme mental and emotional load. I'm tired of working in a broken system that doesn't actually help people achieve wellness and doesn't educate and teach patients. I have mentored/taught in my professional career, and in addition to working in healthcare I have also coached high level athletics. I love growing people and helping them move forward with confidence. Coupling healthcare and coaching seemed like an obvious transition.
I am interested in the information to grow personally and better support my family to have better health as well as financially. I am an intuitive and have certified in Quantum Healing practices and would like to enhance what I can offer people in need.
I’ve always been interested in holistic methods and have spent time and money trying to be healthier. I’d like to help myself and also other people now to get to the root causes and have a truly healthier life.
I've been an RN fo over 30 years. I want to be on the forefront of preventative medicine and help patients to reach their goals and find new pride in caring for themselves!
I’m a bodybuilding coach who has some decent familiarity with dysfunction and helping difficult cases with clients and have done some great work already but no certification to go along with my work.
I enjoy understanding as much about a person as I can to bring about the most possible improvement in their quality of life. I both conversely take a direct and indirect approach to my bodywork. This seems like a very important layer and I believe I have the beginnings of a good network to work with.
"Hello, 
 My experience begins with “waking up” during the Covid confusion and losing my mother during that time for not knowing what I’ve taught myself since then.
I
I’ve been on my own healing journey repairing my gut, liver, thyroid etc because no doctor seems to understand my labs. I’m 100% healthy according to each place I get labs done, yet I need meds. ???

I may still not understand my own labs, but from the healing I’ve experienced on this journey, I’ve discovered a passion to not only help myself, but others. 

I recently healed my son of strep without antibiotics which was one of the BEST feelings, indescribable."
I like to help people
Hello,  I have 40 years of nursing behind me.  My favorite positions have been working in ER and Hospice.   I have always been a homeopathic type of person.  I even make my own mayo.  I do work some with essential oils for friends.  I always find out what their individual problems are and make each product just for them.  90% says what I have done works better than any dr
Want to start offering peptides the legal way
The seat of my truth is what brought me here. I want clarity of my divine purpose and to help others to want and to pursue theirs.
As a psychotherapist and minister, I want to help the whole person, so functional and integrative medicine seems to the right paradigm to help my clients.  I want to help them mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
Hi Sarah, I'm Lauren- based in Austin, TX! I honestly did not even put a ton of thought into this before just going for it. I have recently been addressing my own gut and hormonal imbalances with an FNP, and am amazed that the work I've done so far is actually working. But this is with very little information/without a gut panel and only very basics for #s/hormones that were checked. I want to understand more deeply what is going on in my body to be causing the imbalances it was having/still healing through. When I saw on the course description that I would be able to interpret labs, I signed up. I am not expecting to change careers as of now- though it would be a very sweet surprise if this did replace my income! But I'm in this purely to be able to educate myself so I can be my best self- and would find so much joy in helping other people solve their own puzzle. Currently I am a cardiovascular technologist in cardiac cath and electrophysiology labs. I love what I do but do not advocate for our healthcare system- I believe modern medicine should be a last resort. That said I absolutely want to serve others through a holistic modality, because that is where my heart really is/what I believe in. Our bodies are our temples. And to have freedom in my schedule/not working  10+hr days in a sterile setting every day is also something I know I want to be able to transition into eventually. Thank you for providing this course, I look forward to seeing where it goes- big or small!
Looking to integrate this into my practice. Wellness is my passion and I want to also improve my own through this journey.
20+ year journey navigating a dysfunctional health care system as a patient diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Over the last decade I’ve been self-learning from various resources about genetics, epigenetics, metabolic disorders, heavy metals, vitamin and nutrient imbalances, etc attempting to uncover potential root causes of my own health problems. It has been empowering yet also very confusing at times trying to discern what is accurate when varying degrees of general consensus from “non-traditional” functional space (and usually totally at odds with allopathic physicians focused on treating symptoms and not root causes).
Interested in learning more about functional and integrative medicine
Looking to implement this i to my business
Am a RN, always felt I'd rather be a alternative med practitioner.  also done Aromatherapy work for clients in past.  am a distributor for stem cell activation patches. want to help my stem cell customers understand what is happening in their body, and also start a consulting business in Integrative/Functional Med.  I am a very young 71 yr old, semi-retired home health nurse and case manager.
I have all of the skills and knowledge to do it. I just need some type of certificate with the name in it and this sounded like a good program. I also wanted to see what non-healthcare professionals would see and feel confident enough to start their own practice.
I have been struggling with my hormone health as well as my daughter’s health. She has PCOS and various other health issues. I am tired of doctors not really helping
I want to have a solid foundation in coaching clients on just about anything health and well-being related and making intelligent recommendations, life-changing support, and root-cause oriented solutions so that I can truly help people heal, transform, restore, grow, and create lives they love.
I am a pharmacist for many years now and realizing that pharmaceuticals are not the best treatment for most people and hope to benefit everyone arrond  me & my pts
Hi Sarah! I saw your Black Friday deal and it said I could also get 40+ CEU's so I need 15 every year for my license in Traditional Chinese Medicine. I've had training in functional medicine but wanted to get refresh. However, I was disappointed at the upsell because it made me feel like I wasn't getting everything. Anyways, do you have an affiliate program? Looking forward to connecting soon.
Want to figure out my own health challenges and help friends and family.
Im a RN w 20 years experience. I want to share my knowledge
"Functional Medicine is something l am very interested in. I am currently a nutritional Scientist and wanted to take my education to the next level
So l can services my clients even better."
I have been on a breast cancer journey for almost 3 years now. The first year and a half I addressed it holistically and ended up with a stage 4 diagnosis. Now I’m doing things conventionally but am wanting to truly understand my body on a deeper level so I can help it heal for good. Also my 63 year old mom is starting to show cognitive decline symptoms and I really want to help her without having to send her to someone else who she can’t afford. Lastly I want to have this knowledge to take care of my small children as they grow up 🙏🏼
Well I started my health and wellness journey 5 years ago and ever since I have watched my body transform, I have been in love with the art of well-being. I’ve often thought to myself what it would be like to help others on their wellness journey as a health coach, but I knew I wanted deeper than that. I want to be able to help my elderly mom and other people I come across master their health to enjoy life more and even improve my own. So from there I started researching what was needed to get started in integrative and functional medicine.
I want to learn more about functional lab assessment and analysis
"I am preparing to leave working for others and this ad in FB was a coincidence . I have been wishing for this exactly.  I have several projects at hand right now and coaching was a second step . However, I saw this opportunity and took it.  I will be studying a little later but am glad I am already in . 

I work in healthcare and understand holistic and alternative medicine ."
I am very passionate about holistic health and functional medicine. I have been studying and practicing functional medicine for over 20 years. What has led me to this course is to develop my knowledge and be more confident. I know enough to get me in trouble lol. I want to really understand on a deeper level. My mother was in a car accident in 2017 and was left a a paraplegic due to a Brain and spinal cord injury. As one of her primary caregivers I have learned a lot about medicines and the healthcare industry. I became very passionate about getting to the Root of diseases and it has saved my mother’s Life. My fiancé also has Hashimoto’s and I want to become more educated to help him as well. I also am in menopause and trying to learn more about hormones and my own body. I am currently seeing a functional medicine doctor but  I would like to turn my passion into purpose and help others with total confidence and not be dependent on another doctor always. All of my friends and family always come to me for supplement recommendations on to fix whatever is going on in their lives. I would like to think I am really good at it and have gotten a lot of good results from the knowledge I do have. I do currently on my own stressful business, but I am looking into the future of retirement and would like to go into this direction. I could talk forever about my story and how sick my family has been. I just wanna help people, including my own self and family.
Curiosity
I love learning.
Just launched my health business after years of own sickness and gettong better naturally
I got really excited about a vision I have of creating an amazing sleep course based on Chinese Medicine 5 element balance. I partnered up with my close friend who is an Acupuncturist & he said he would write a book based on the  5 elements & sleep but it has been 2 years and he hasn't gotten very far. I was always having encouraging conversations with him about how amazing this course was going to be and couldn't understand why things were going so slowly. I finally understood that this was my dream, not his dream. I told him we should do our businesses separately and now I need in depth knowledge as well as certifications to get quality supplements. I saw that one of your courses is specifically on sleep although I loved the water & hydration one as well as several others I think will enhance my course! :)
I wrote a good explanation but there were no spots for a 30 minute call and it looks like what I wrote was lost
I am a psychologist and want to learn more about how to better treat my patients
Gain more knowledge
I am a Naturopathic Doctor, Patented Inventor of Health Products, a Ph.D., TV Host and Author... BUT, I love to keep learning. I have a healthy N.D. practice where I provide telehealth services (TheLifeDoc.org), but am always wanting to learn to better serve my clients. That's why I'm here.
I was in surgical and respiratory medical sales and had to quit because I developed ovarian cancer and then developed core lymphedema from the surgical procedures to remove the cancer. I have been on an ever evolving  holistic healing journey and have already done extensive research for my personal journey.  I have already helped myself and I want to help others while making some money. My large tumor was 10cm. I had a full hysterectomy.  I then opted for no chemo and treated holistically, used cancer diet protocols, ivermectin, sound therapy, energy therapy, rebounding, compression leggings/ yoga pants, compression underwear, vibration plate machine, red light therapy, dry brushing, manual drainage and lymphatic movement techniques, meditation, breath work, quality sleep practices, frequency therapies, supplement combination therapy ,etc
I’m a Doctor by background your advert showed up on instagram. Was fascinated and bought the course but the upselling part is abit annoying
I love empowering and educating women and young girls
Hello Sarah, my mother,s name was Sarah she passed away 2022, she told me I missed my calling,I should have been a nurse. I have been a care giver since I was a little girl taking care of sick animals, later on I took are of my mother from the age of 14 she was mentally ill. I moved out of my grandparents house at the age of 22 my mother moved in with me when I was 24. As my grandparents aged I took care of them until they passed away. My grandfather had many health issues that I had to learn to manage. I also took care of my step-son who went into a thyroid storm and we lossed him twice, after he left the hospital he came to live with us. I am the person that everyone calls with medical and financial questions. I love reaching medical illnesses. I would like to work with people who has had or have brain aneurysms, I had one repaired in 2017 and it was very scary.
Curiosity
I am a physician by profession.Couldnt pursue my specialization in medicine due to family and financial committments.i was not satisfied working as a general practitioner.i did a mba an moved into management and stopped clinical practice.i feel i can make an impact in peoples life if i get specialised training..
Many factors throughout my life has led me to this moment. My grandmother's life long sentence to juvenile diabetes and her end of life journey with Alzheimers. My mom's 20 year journey with Multiple Sclerosis spiked a huge curiosity in me searching for way to help her reduce the 22 pill regimen she was prescribed to treat more symptoms of the previous pills side effects than the actual disease. The final spark that started the fire in my soul and motivated my search for knowledge was at the end of 2019 when my 16 daughter has steel rods inserted into her leg and refused prescription pain medication. I created a multiple essential oils rub for pain that worked on her high level of pain. That triggered me to try it on a friend that needed hip replacement surgery due to extreme pain when walking. He found it to relieved his pain for short periods. So, lots of research and endless reading landed me here with this opportunity.
I have always been dedicated to helping others and after my son was born with a life threatening condition I have made it my mission to learn any and everything that could help him or other families in the same situation. I currently hold several certifications but would like to expand my knowledge.
I have been managing my own autoimmune conditions for 10 + years, wrote a book in 2018 called Undoing Hashimoto’s, have been working in spa and holistic wellness education for 20 + years. Was teaching Spa Wellness Coaching in 2020 to professionals in the spa industry who needed to make money while COVID had shut down all in person business. Then my youngest daughter, Charlotte 11, was killed in a car accident with an intoxicated driver. I couldn’t coach anymore, I felt I had lost my world and passion for work. I went back to working in spa management. Then my husband died 18 months later. It’s been 5 years - a journey of grief and survival. My eldest is now 20 and a junior in university. It felt time to get back into this.
I was also a single mom of 3 kids. I also lost a child when he was 2 1/2 months old due to heart defects. One of my kids is on the autistic spectrum but we have worked through many of his symptoms. Through a doc I took him to I ended up owning a treatment clinic where we did testing and many different medical therapy interventions. Long story short, I eventually closed the center due to issues with our medical director. I went on to get my certification as an Integrative Health Coach but have only done it as a ministry.  I’ve been a caregiver for my mom and aunt who both recently passed away and decided to update and expand my knowledge and start doing this to make income.
I was a teacher for 25 years - physics and geoscience- in public school.  Retired and opened up my own coffee shop.  After 5 years of 3am wake ups and no downtime, my health and my business partner's health began to take a nose dive.  After much trial and error and tons of reading on my part and reaching out to friends who are doctors and trying out HBOT we finally started feeling better.  The HBOT was a game changer and since none were around our location, we bought one and started our next business.  I continue to read and share what I learn, promote not only our HBOT but our VIBE bed as well as different ways that can help your body heal itself with the addition of a healthy eating habits, fasting, lots of water, positive thoughts, and being active.  I am healthy again, and I feel great.  It took me over a year to get to where i am now, and I want others to share in that same joy of getting their lives back.
I have been on my own journey of root cause and healing from Hashimoto's.  I am a burned out registered nurse and looking for ways to continue my healing journey and help others along the way.  Turning this into a source of income would make it that much better.
"I come from a medical family, but I do not like the current healthcare model, which is over dependent on pharmaceuticals.  They help the symptoms but doesn't address the root causes of illness. I want to create a new company to address what I consider the root causes of illness; Malnutrition, Dehydration, Environmental Factors, Genetic Factors, and Stress."
Im in between jobs right now and was wanting to learn more and look at different ways to get healthy overall
I was nurse for 45 years. I retired, then my health took a drastic turn downhill. I’m generally healthy, but was recently diagnosed with Lupus. It’s been a real eye opener and a bit scary. I know now that gut health is number 1#! Why are we not taught that? Why have my doctors not talked about this! I don’t want to rely on the medical field to get me back to good health. I’m striving for optimal health!
I love helping people with their health issues.  I have spent my life analyzing labs and designing supplement protocols.  I want to coach people and feel showing a certification even if not accredited will help build client trust
I want to make a difference in peoples lives
"I have been in the medical field since 2020, and I have
worked as certified clinical medical assistant, a care
coordinator, and a practice supervisor.  I have also
struggled with ""unsolved mysteries"" in my own health,
which also turned into me helping others ""off the 
record"".  I saw this as the perfect fit for me."
I am here to gain more knowledge about helping others with feeling the best they can and to use my nursing skills to start a business where I can work from home and have more time with my family and travel and work from anywhere
I’m a retired nurse and certified Reiki master and wanted to add these to my practice
I am a nurse practitioner who wants to enrich her knowledge to help my patients better
I trained as a naturopathic nutritional therapist in 2015 but life got in the way.   I have studied with Functional medicine University but will be unable to certify as my nutrition diploma is not to their requirements
Personal experience
Oh, this would be a loooonnnnng story.  I've had so many life-challenging events, mostly in the past 5 years,  that have led me to search for something extra.  I've tried to find traditional medical answers and research functional medical treatments on my own for PCOS, infertility,  metabolic syndrome, TBI recovery, breast cancer support, chemo support, post hysterectomy protocol, anti-inflammatory wound healing, immune system support, and a thousand other little things.  I am an FNP who works in the Emergency Department.  I see DAILY areas where the traditional medical approach has gapped knowledge or treatment protocols.  I want to help fill those gaps.
I’m an RN of 10 years. I’m certified in wound care WCC. I recently had a baby girl who is now 9 months old. I never went back to my nursing job so I could stay with her. My husband builds houses and to supplement our income we opened an LLC where I clean the new construction houses he builds. He’s currently building 75 of them. I also clean my friends 7 Airbnb’s. My husband also coaches baseball and has partnered with a gym for pitching lessons. There is an opportunity for me to start a wellness portion at the gyms news location. So here I am, sort of lost in what to do but wanting to learn . I’d love to help people find a root cause of their issue instead of shoving pills down their throats. I want to help others. I also have a bachelors degree in psychology. I love the flexibility I have right now yo be with my son and daughter as well.
I don't want people to make the same health mistakes I've made. I want them to be able to make informed decisions about their health with the best information possible.
My daughters and I are enrolled in Doula classes.  I have always been interested in Natural Pathic Healing.  I come from a family of Healthcare professionals that are patient well being oriented.  What better way to formally a purpose than in Healing.
I'm starting a telehealth practice and and wanting to learn more about functional medicine.
Currently I hold a Masters degree in holistic nutrition, I am a Live Blood Cell Practitioner and co-owner of Holistic Lifestyle Center in Holly Springs Ga. I have a good client base with fantastic results which turns into referrals. I liked the certification program that you are offer which  I hope furthers my education as it is key to keep learning to stay up with new research etc in the ever changing world of real health care. I have been in the nutrition industry for over 35 years and believe we never have all the answers if we stop learning. I began my journey at 17years old, if you want to read my bio you can find it on the website Holisticlifestylecenter.org
I'm a successful wellness coach that makes more than 200 grand a year. I'm always looking for more information to improve the work I am already doing. If there is more information here I can gain to help me get even better results, I want to know it.
Because I want to grow my knowledge and better my services with my clientele and patients.
I am a licensed massage therapist and a holistic kinesiologist (muscle testing and energy balancing). I am a lifelong learner and am open to learning more and more things that could help me and my family and my clients and my community. This was a no-brainer! I believe it takes many different modalities to address the many complexities of the human experience.
I'm an Esthetician with over 14 years of experience and I would love to help my client beyond the surface of their skin
Im very interested in functional care and wanted to get my toes wet
I was Soul guided to study functional medicine years ago but having a small kid and a business I wasn't able to finish my case study reports and was left without certification. I thought I'd not let that stop me from working but it has.
The reason I was compelled to invest in this certification. My daughter has a lot of issues that we (the family) believe are an unknown autoimmune or chronic illness. I would like to assist her in her journey as much as I can. It's very difficult to watch your child stay in so much pain. I hope this certification will help me gain a better insight into why she is experiencing these symptoms. She is already receiving medical care. I think they are missing something. I feel she needs another component added to her treatment. I prayed to GOD for help and this program appeared in my algorithm.
I'm looking for a platform with diverse educational information in one location.
Im a master trainer owner of a dental practice and am bringing in peptides and think this cert will be helpful
I’m starting a health coaching business. I’m always looking to optimize my own health and help others do the same.
Hi, Sara, my name is Joanne and I'm a nurse working 3 twelves/week and looking to get into something with a little more.....I feel like I needed this for my family's health and my own health but still be able to provide help to others and be able to have my own practice.  I want out of the bedside and out into my own life.
"This year has been pretty stressful for my  husband and I. After struggling with rashes for many years, this year it was horrific, burning and itching, from head to toe. I've always been bad about dealing with stress and it showed in my physical health. I was eventually diagnosed with Lupus, which I have probably had for years. But once treatment started, the rash has cleared,  my fatigue is gone and I can get back to life again. At the same time, my husband developed 4 arterial clots in his left leg. He doesn't have much plaque and the doctors can't explain why this happened. I believe it was the covid vaccine. But who knows. Now he is on blood thinners for life, and runs the risk of losing his foot. 
I know that the stress has affected my health and I'm just now learning how important gut health is. I'm a retired nurse and yet I didn't realize how much our gut health affects our body! 
Because of the things I've experienced, I've decided my experience could help me help others. I'm ready to find the way to do that."

I think I already did this part but just in case I didn't.  Here we go: My family has fought with weight and health issues for many years.  From cancers to heart issues, diabetics, dementia, lung diseases, obesity and the list goes on.  Health and wellness has been a passion of mine for many, many years.  I was a single mom of two amazing boys starting at the young age of 17 and 19.  Cancer hit me but I punched back 3 times and still continue the fight.  6 days before my youngest turned 20, someone ran him off the road and left him for dead, we lost him that day along with half of my heart.  My husband (not their father) and I moved to AZ in Dec of 2023 to take care of my father.  I currently work running 2, 55+ communities along with managing a Trim Clinic, went back to school and became a Laser Tech, then went back and got certified to a phlebotomy tech, and on and on and then.....opened my own MedSpa end of March 2025.  Still doing the parks and still helping at the other place, but oh boy howdy, I'm super wore out most days and want to narrow it down to my Spa and coaching.  This course is going to help push me a little harder to get to the goals I have in place.  To be independent in my own business.
I love medicine
Our bodies fascinate me! I started my young adult life out with my BSN and worked as an RN for only two years before having our first child and then choosing to defer my aspirations of becoming an advanced practice nurse until my kids were in school. But we decided to have more kids (stopped at 4), started a business and then it really didn’t make sense for me to go back to nursing. I maintained my love for research and continued casually diving into the world of medicine over the years. I’ve personally weathered many medical storms (gullian barre, chiari malformation & decompression surgery, PCOS, hysterectomy and the world of HRT, mold toxicity and CIRS) and have researched and clawed my way to healing from each one of those challenges. I never accepted “you’re a stressed out mom of 4,” which was the answer I got more times than not. I thankfully had the resources and knowledge to keep fighting and keep trying until I finally found answers and the right people to help me heal. But it was like finding different pieces to a puzzle literally scattered all over this country. That is what frustrates me. That is what drives me. I don’t want others having to find their puzzle pieces in this confusing world of medicine. Friends and family have seen my fights and now come to me and ask if I have advice for them. And honestly, I don’t. I don’t know where to send them or how to lead them, other than to research for themselves. I want to recommend what worked for me, but I don’t know enough about their labs, their histories, etc. to confidently help them. This is why I’ve signed up for your class. Our youngest is graduating high school at the end of this month. He’ll begin flight school in January and we will officially be empty nesters with ample time on our hands. I will have the time to invest in others outside of our home and truly feel like this is step one. I’m really looking forward to it!
I’ve been an RN over 20 years. I’ve seen what doesn’t work. I want to learn what does. I want to learn how to live healthier, how to help my family live healthier and how to help others reach real health.
I'm 58 yrs. Old, I'm tired and tired of seeing people suffer from poor medical guidance. I've lost faith in American medicine and believe there is a better way that includes the path of functional medicine. I love helping people achieve health and wellness, this is a life long passion of mine. To be certified and have the support behind me to really help people heal seemed like the right choice to make.
Want to help
Love to learn different things from different experts
I have two Doctorates and I want to do something more holistic
Wanting to start my own buisness
I am a RN for over 20 years I left the bedside about 3 years ago and started working for IV therapy homecare. I’ve been trying to start an IV hydration wellness business for about 2 years and finally opened in October. I somehow wanted to incorporate my yoga & Reiki certification as well. I have not practiced Reiki that much and only still teach yoga every once in a while. I am into functional and integrative medicine but I really don’t want to go back to college at 47 to get my NP I have a son in college 1 in high school and a 4 year old lol. My business is super slow I do feel very knowledgeable about the supplement and natural world and find myself constantly giving advice to friends, family, patients, and the few clients I’ve had. To survive I know I need the IV hydration but my true passion lies more in the natural energetic world but I do feel this is the perfect blend. I want to always learn more so feel this is a good step and I can actually afford it. I feel like I’m already somewhat of a nurse coach but living in NY trying to create I feel it’s better to have a certification before I can call myself a coach.
"My story is a long journey of healing, transformation, and rediscovering my own voice.
I grew up in Romania, became a registered nurse, and raised my two sons alone. For many years, I lived in survival mode — working multiple jobs, caring for others, and ignoring my own needs. Later, I moved to Italy, then to the United States, and each chapter reshaped me.

Four years ago, during a deep healing retreat, something awakened inside me. I realized that the body, the emotions, and the subconscious are profoundly interconnected — and that true healing goes far beyond medication or lifestyle tips. That moment completely changed the direction of my life.

Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to understanding the human mind, trauma, the emotional body, energy, and somatic healing. I became a hypnotist, I lead emotional release work, and I help women reconnect with themselves. But I always felt there was one missing piece: the functional, physiological understanding of the body.

That’s why Level 1 felt exactly right for me. I want to bring together hypnosis, tapping, intuitive healing, and functional wellness — so I can support people not just emotionally, but holistically. I want to understand what is happening in their hormones, gut, stress systems, and metabolism, so I can guide them more effectively.

For the first time, I feel aligned with both my heart and my purpose.
Investing in this certification felt like the next natural step — a bridge between everything I’ve lived, everything I’ve learned, and the practitioner I am becoming.

It felt like coming home to myself."
I have a calling and a passion to heal people. I work in the healthcare industry as a revenue cycle manager for the last 23 years, but I do a lot of mindfulness activities and find ways to cope with trauma apart from western medicine. I been told by countless behavioral health practitioners that I really should move into a trauma-informed service. Which I know in my heart is where my life purpose is. I will be graduating in two weeks with my MBA concentration in Entrepreneurship. So I believe it is time for me to serve my purpose.
I am currently an IT professional. My under graduate degree is geared to do the work I am doing right now. Lately I am finding that all the effort I put in is going nowhere because the biggest hurdle is navigating personal and professional relationships. In the end the key is being able to navigate politics as opposed to a clear vision of a career path. It is frustrating to see people getting credited for things you worked hard for. This is my way of creating my own niche and possibly providing a solution to corporate and organizational disfunction by addressing the needs of the worker as a whole (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual). I heard a wise saying from a recent service provider - Work as a spiritual path or something like that. Since my challenges are at work, I would like to be able to explore solutions that helps organizations break out of the duldrums and create a workforce that uplifts individual that work therein. We spend most of our time as adults working. Shouldn't it be a place where people feel inspired, creative, productive? As a second goal, I feel I am called to study how to support  mental health. Probably because I struggled with it myself. Not to the point where I needed medication but as a regular person going thru the motions of everyday life. Also, being one of the minorities of people who are single and will probably be single forever. It is a bit of a challenge. That is not to say I am not social. But having a lot of time alone can sometimes take you to places that may not be pleasant at times.
In addition to being an APRN (MCH CNS), I've already acquired several certifications (IIN, Amen Clinics, Neuroencoding Institute) & studied others (HeartMath, INE) and had my own successful lactation consulting practice w pump rentals back in the 80s (I'm 74 & still teaching >> MSN, MPH, DNP students). I've also been blessed to receive TBI recovery guidance from early experts in Integrative Medicine that got me interested in learning how to navigate my own genomics recovery. Since a lot of that recovery is not Pharmaceuticals or skills like surgery, patients are not accessing personalized integrative treatment plans. So I have been gradually working my way into being prepared as an RN coach. I've been fortunate as an RN to have a very diversified CV but I'd like to be prepared more comprehensively, rather than by body system, as I am presently.
I am an olive have been unhealthy since a child. My personal health has been in and out of dr and hospital visits and stays. It has led me to understand emergency medical is very ne essay however it should not ve depended on for daily health and primary care physicians can only practice medicine. Therfore we must all learn what true health aecided to stay away from them and learn as much as I could however google is not a truthful source of education so i sought out a natund complete wellness is. So I sought out a naturopath but there prices were expensive. And when I finally got to one, they knew almost as much as me.  So then I decided to start naturopath school and did. But I now realize  there is a lot of core issues i am missing because my health is still bad. Better but not helped as much as I need. I suffer from electrolite imbalance and fluctuation, high and low bloodpressure, problems while detoxing, eye trouble, diabeties and much more. My goal is to take these classes to learn for my own health and then help others and then finish my naturopath classes to get a full well rounded education on health so that i can help others. Yes finances is important but nearly as improtant as helping myself and others even the ones that really cant afford it, yet need the help. Finances are directly tied to to mind, body and soul clearing. I will be able to do it all and truely help others.,
I’ve been a nurse for 32 years. I stepped down from the hospital setting about a year and a half ago. I started another career non-medical and enjoy doing it but don’t feel like it is my purpose. I have been talking to a speech therapist friend who is very into functional medicine. I found it intriguing so I decided to take the first step and begin to educate myself on the subject.
I’ve always been drawn to helping people. I am currently working on a Peptide certification as well and wanna help people perform and get to their optimal wellness and the most health conscious ways getting rid of Russian medicine and all the prescription drugs and having people feeling their best.
"I'm 67 years old, been in the medical field all my life. Respiratory Therapist for 11 years, Optician for 10 years (worked for the Optometrist for 16 years - started front desk and worked my way up), then went back to nursing school and graduated RN at 53 years old. Been an Aesthetic Nurse for 14 years. I work at a Dermatology, Aesthetic, Integrative Medicine Practice. As you can tell, I've always loved helping/serving people. I have been  married for 41 years, have 2 children with spouses and 4 grandchildren. For the last 2 years I have only been working 2 days/week. Working towards what I thought ""retirement"", but I love still seeing my patients and keeping up with what's going on with them and the community. My husband still works part time, as well, he is in the oil and gas industry and travels to Refineries to inspect during outages. We have often thought it would be great for me to be able to travel with him (as he stays in our 5th wheel trailer - our home away from home). So, when I saw your ad about Functional Medicine Coaching and could work the same 2 days/week (and hopefully some of it remote), that really excited me that I could still help patients and be with my husband. My husband and I are all about eating as healthy as possible, working out 3-4 days/week, getting good sleep, and staying as calm as possible (Thank you Jesus !!)  I am super excited with this new opportunity and can't thank you enough !!!"
Hi. My name is Tori. I’ll start by saying that I’ve been passionate about learning about the human body since I was a child. I also enjoy caring for others which led me to becoming a registered nurse. Ive been a nurse for 20 years and find it fulfilling but my passion is women’s health particularly because I’ve been on a roller coaster health journey for the last 8 years of my life related to thyroid issues, fatigue, hormonal imbalances etc. I am a recently separated mom to five wonderful children( 4 daughters and one son). I want to be an example for my children, other women and coach myself on this journey of life. I’ve asked myself, what’s something I would do for free the rest of my life. The answer is coaching, encouraging, teaching and helping women especially those in their 30s-50s find real lasting solutions to their health challenges. However, being a separated mom and with less income, I need to do something that combines my passion and will create financial gains. This program is an answered prayer.
I have always wanted to be in the medical field in any way, shape or form. Many of my family members are in the medical field.
I have been in medicine for the last 15 years, I was a former paramedic, and then became a medical Dr. I have recently stepped away from the actual practice of medicine in favor of my own ecommerce enterprise come also in the medical field, and I also spend a lot of time teaching and lecturing as well. This is something that I'm very interested in, functional medicine aspect of things. I believe there's a lot of value in that and I believe there's a lot of bad information been given out, and I think I could bring value to clients
"I have been a certified holistic health practitioner for several years and have a passion to help people take hold of their health and transform their life. I have discovered that I know lots of things that help people on simpler levels but long to help with deeper issues like Hormone balance and thyroid issues. I’m not great at reading labs and really need a leg up on doing this a better way. I want to be consistently effective in how I help people.
I use various ‘tools’ such as muscle response testing & biofeedback, and use essential oils with various other modalities….but want more! 
I’m a mother of 4 kids and homeschool my youngest 2. I’m grateful this course is self paced so I can find time to fit this in!"
I want a new career to help people feel better on the inside and out and help myself to improve and grow
Acupuncturist seeking functional med training
I love to help others. I have been in a C-suite high-level career for the past 20 years. I am passionate about health, healing, helping, and happiness. I eventually want to leave the corporate world. My husband just started his own business, we have three busy teens, and a crazy, fun, and busy life. I am ready for a change and excited to explore something new that I am passionate about!
It’s my passion and life purpose
I have a 20 yo daughter with 26 diagnosis, latest with mold exposure. I have researched the majority of what you're offering and just need the certification to back up what I've learned.
Gain knowledge
I actually have a background in certified clinical hypnotherapy, NLP, EFT, & Matrix Reimprinting and have combined it with Akashic Record reading (and no, my information recieved is never wrong as I use my own created system of pendulum work ((there are specific ways to ensure accurate results and no, most practitioners do not know this or do the correct setup!)), Sidereal astrology and have studied the 'woo-woo' side of quantum physics and the sacred geometry of the body and basically just how all things work ((dimensions, particals through dimensions that eventually create what we perceive as 'physical reality')) for the last 10+ years combining them all together that has allowed me to track down information from past lives, ancestral inheritance, etc. giving me a system that has uncovered information that you would not believe commanding the release of after finding it, things literally change overnight) HOWEVER I am also 100% aware that due to lifestyles, the food we eat, the toxins built up, that tobtruly fasttrack the healing and removal of issues in the body, that if I can also combine and integrate functional medicine and interpret labs, etc. That I would have an edge and combination that would allow people to change their lives instantly.   And if I can interpret labs, I can also fasttrack the physical healing of dis-ease in the body in ways that are going to feel and work like magic!  I want all areas covered and so here I am!
I want to know more in functional medicine
I have what it takes
I choose holistic medicine because it focuses on treating the whole person—not just symptoms. It looks at the connection between mind, body, and lifestyle, allowing me to address the root causes of issues rather than just masking them. Holistic approaches support long-term wellness, emphasize natural healing, and encourage healthy habits that improve overall quality of life. It’s a path that aligns with my desire for balance, prevention, and a deeper understanding of my own health.
I like to help and I enjoy understanding our wellness
I am retiring from RN May 2026. I have extensive experience in behavioral health, home health, public health, telehealth, case management and hospital nursing. I enjoy counseling patient education and coaching people to be towards wellness.
I am an occupational therapist. I have had a lifelong interest in health and wellness. I experienced first hand, an auto immune disease and appear to overcome it. I am always interested in learning more and investing in my education to provide the best information for my patients.
I’m a personal chef and I like ti help my clients better .
I am an occupational therapist and have always had a great interest in functional health. I did want to be a naturopath long before it was well known however it was not a legal practice in my state. As a functional therapist I have always wanted to expand my ability to help my clients beyond their physical needs.
I want to understand how to read my client’s medical charts and go beyond the typical foundations applied.
As a hypnotherapist and energetic healer i am always interested in upgrading my knowledge
I have a nutrition coach certification and am currently adding functional health courses to my knowledge base. I have a busy full time job and I’m a mom of 3. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease last year and have spent the last year learning all I can to reverse my disease and have been very successful so far. I want to learn more about interpreting own labs and possibly coach others in the future.
i’m a registered marriage and family therapist and would like to add this knowledge and certification to my practice
I have dealt with a lot of ‘strange’ medical issues and feel 1) I would LOVE to know more about what is actually going on and how to move forward and 2) I NEED to show other people that there IS a way thru all this! I currently own and run 2 construction companies but they don't bring me purpose and they sure they heck don't bring in extra money, they just pay the bills.
I am a psychotherapist wanting more understanding of underlying medical issues that may impact my clients overall wellbeing
Ive been fighting auto-immunity problems my whole life. I know a lot but not enough to coach. I’d like to fill in the gaps
I currently hold a masters in nursing and my primary focus is away from bedside, but I have a true passion for educating others, and I am really hoping that this certificate will allow me to reach patients and provide them a coaching experience that will better themselves without the use of traditional medicine.
I have always felt the current healthcare model was broken.  It is too heavily reliant on pharmaceuticals and surgery to alleviate symptoms, rather than trying to find the root causes of diseases.
Ive been a teacher for 25 years and recently had to push pause professionally to bring my mom home and become a full time care taker. I have thyroid issues and these courses are going to not only help me understand what is going on with me but I can also help other women who are struggling with their thyroid. Ready to start learning!!
I feel I can benefit from this personally and if I can help others that’s a bonus

I've been in emergency medicine for 23 years , and want to do something different....  I am a paramedic
Interested in this for mysel
We are expanding our services and rebranding to become a wellness center. Our goal is to offer clinical therapy and health/wellness coaching. I am already a certified life coach and wellness coach. However I am learning everything I can before we market the new business.
"I’m a massage therapist and Ayurvedic practitioner and yoga instructor.
Helping others is what I do.
Saw this course and thought it would be beneficial"
Want to learn more about functional medicine. I see see so many people struggling with health problems, that the doctors aren't helping them with. They just prescribe them with new pills, that don't really help and don't heal. On my own I have learned about natural healing, and many different supplements, but when I recommend them, I don't get taken seriously. I would like certification, so that I can legitimately recommend Health protocols, and supplements to friends, family and others. I also have an interest in selling supplementation.
I’ve been a Respiratory Care Practitioner for ten years, and what I’ve learned in my time working bedside with critically ill patients, is a lot of this could have been prevented with using food as medicine. And we don’t have a healthcare system that supports that mentality. I also have family members suffering from a multitude of different ailments from high blood pressure, diabetes, dementia, chronic kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, PCOS, the list goes one. I believe in a holistic approach to medicine and want to educate myself and family in a way that they’ve been failed over the years by traditional western medicine.
"I was a practicing chiropractor for years before my eldest son was born with a rare genetic disorder. When he arrived 20 years ago, everything in my life reoriented around keeping him alive and stable. I stepped away from my practice to become his full-time caregiver, advocate, and case manager. What was meant to be a temporary pause quickly became a permanent ending to my career. The constant stream of hospitalizations, procedures, transfusions, and appointments left me with no room to maintain my professional life. Renewing my license wasn’t a choice I declined — it was simply crowded out, and the door closed.

At the same time, my own health has been quietly — and at times loudly — falling apart. I’ve lived for decades with fluctuating but worsening chronic pain, fatigue, brain fog, and hormonal shifts. Conventional medicine has failed me at every turn, often relying on the lazy default of labeling me as a psychiatric case. In my desperation, I turned to genetic testing, which has shown immune mechanism dysfunction. It’s not a straightforward diagnosis, but it’s a start.

I’m using this certification as a way to integrate my previous clinical training, my lived experience, and the emerging science around immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and chronic illness — not only for my own healing, but eventually for my son’s as well.

For me, this program is a bridge between who I was as a practitioner, who I’ve become as a caregiver, and the person I am now — someone who has lived both sides of chronic illness and wants to use that experience with purpose. And part of that purpose is choosing to get well, not only because my son will need lifelong support and my other children and loved ones rely on me, but because I want to feel like myself again. I’m tired of slogging through life. I want joy, energy, and a life that feels lived — not endured. This certification is me putting my own mask on first and choosing a different path forward."
"1- I’m 55 and the physical part of the job is not sustainable until retirement age. 
2- My family history with autoimmune conditions 
3- Menopause 🤪"
I have been in the health industry for a long time discovering new things but I wanted something that felt more structure and professional
For health betterment, have a new perspective on health and work from home
Holistic healing has always been a passion of mine. I have worked in the industry helping people and love it!
I really want to understand my body and labs.
"I have been a nurse practitioner for 25 years. I love taking care of patients, helping to improve their health, well-being and quality of life. Over the years, I've seen the healthcare industry become less and less about patient care and more and more about the bottom line. After practicing as an NP for a few years, I started precepting nurse practitioner students. I truly enjoy teaching patients as well as students. I then decided to go back to school and earned my doctorate of nursing practice with the goal of teaching nurse practitioners to be the next generation of dedicated healthcare providers. I left cardiology for academia after 14 years to teach full time in a graduate family nurse practitioner program. Initially, I loved it. Teaching nurses to advance to the next level, helping them develop into independent healthcare providers was highly fulfilling. Over the 6 years that I remained in academia, my role as professor became less and less about teaching and more and more about committee participation, research, presenting at conferences, increasing exposure for the school and generating revenue through grants and increased enrollment. Sadly, I watched as the quality of program declined. Students were less interested in actual learning, complained about their workload and seemed to expect that the faculty somehow implant the knowledge into their brains without them having to do any work. Their degrees became transactional, bought rather than earned. After a student submitted a complaint to the dean because they emailed my at 2 AM and I hadn't responded by 7 AM on the same day, I decided I'd had enough. I would rather take care of patients who actually appreciated my efforts, so I went back to clinical practice in cardiology. Over the past 5 years, I have truly enjoyed taking care of patients, educating them, supporting them and helping to improve their quality of life. I receive great feedback and appreciation from my patients, often commenting on how I listen to them, explain things and take time with them that no other provider does. This is the part that I enjoy the most; making my patients feel heard and figuring out what is going on with them when other providers run a test then tell them, ""well, it's not your heart"" and dismiss them, leaving them with even more questions than they had before. This method, however, comes at a cost. I am constantly falling behind on documentation, staying late at work and bringing work home. My ADHD medications no longer seem to work. Self-care is non-existent. I am exhausted and my time off is spent worrying about trying to catch up, mindlessly watching tv, listening to audiobooks or doing Sudoku and avoiding going out unless necessary. I have no motivation and do not feel like myself. Something needs to change. I still want to take care of patients and teach, but I don't want to sacrifice the quality of care/education that I provide in order to do paperwork."
"Hi Sarah! I am a registered dental hygienist by profession, life, fitness (I teach zumba and dance)  and wellness coach on the side. I love helping my clients and students set goals ans calm the chaos of life. When I recently dealt with stage zero breast DCIS (early cancer or precancerous calcifications- depending on which indistry you go with) , it was a very interesting awakening to see thr functional medicine world clash with the big pharma driven world...
I would love to offer more to my clients, patients and students in their healing and wellness."
I think I have already filled this out once. I am raising my 4 year old grandson after my daughter died this year. I’m sure this is a partial distraction however I want to have a backup plan if I should not be able to physically work as a nurse.

"I’ve been in the health care field about 20 years. The past 10 years I’ve been trying to learn more natural remedies. 

I was diagnosed with Lymes Disease back in 2010. The past 15 years has been a trial and error approach to find what works for correcting the problems from it.

I have chronic sinusitis and have had allergy issues my whole life. I have a lot of insight and knowledge about tackling that. 

I have watched many people suffer with illnesses that never get resolved. I like to get to the root of things and explore options not just accept what a Doctor tells me."
I've had hashimotos for most of my life. Since the age of 19 and im now 47. I had it reversed at one point but have been in a flare for awhile now. I thought I got to my root cause and removed 7 infected root canals. That's been a year and a half ago and im still struggling and no one seems to help so im doing this for myself and healing on my own. Then possibly help family members with auto immune conditions as well
Hello! I've been a Wellness Chiropractor for over 20 years. I have a strong background in functional medicine, including lab interpretation, but looking for a foundation to implement this into clinic. I thought if I can get the certification and have a systematic method to incorporate it into the office it would offer an added layer of care for our patients.
I began studying herbalism during the pandemic and I've been engulfed ever since. I felt like this course could help propel me forward and also help build my confidence a bit more as I continue on this journey to helping friends and loved ones
Been a registered nurse for 21 years, helped my mom with lung cancer and my son with leukemia and now looking to get back to work but traditional medicine is not feeling good anymore. Single mom, need to provide for my kids
"I have been very interested in the functional medicine approach. I got my first health coach certification in 2010 and my second one, about a year later. I was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in late 2007. That started my health journey. I've been learning ever since.
I have done several ""health"" groups of 8-10 friends, where we explore whatever they want to learn about. 
I live in Ohio and find some of what this class teaches, unusable. I cannot legally hang a shingle or charge a fee unless I work under a Doctor and that is also pretty much impossible. I can suggest that whoever I am working with, sees a doctor, but no doctor referral system here. So being that I will be 70 next month, I will continue to reach out and offer to sort out health but basically it is and has always been more of a ministry and never a business.
I have a grandson who was vaccine injured as an 18 month old (he is now 18 and doing well.) and recently a new adopted 3 year old grandson who is generation O. They are my motivation to continue to learn.
I really don't need another certification but always interested in learning new things and I love the functional medicine approach."
I completed my holistic practitioner certification 7 years ago and started to setup my practice and before I got traction covid hit and I took a regular job.

I am a 43 year old clinical research nurse for the last 10 years. I currently specialize is Mysthinia Gravis, multiple sclerosis and other Autoimmune diseases. I have seen so many of my patients struggle. I know there is more for them. These protocols can potential change their lives. I have apassion to be part in these change. In my own personal world I have struggles for a lifetime with GI issues and a pancreatic disorder. I have been through hell. I tried a protocol for leaky gut and it has helped me. It lead me to want to study and learn more. Ive been praying about the next steps in my life and God has put me in a place that I feel he wants me to build and grow to be able to help more people. So here is the beginning of something I hope can make a change not only in my own life. But with the many patients I see daily who are hurting and struggling just to get through the day. My goal is these folks.
Been looking to know more about functional medicine for a while. Busy with retirement and finally will have time to do this in 3 months
It helps me to help others better
"Being in the health care field as a pharmacist, I felt very frustrated, helpless, and almost in agony when my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and that I couldn't do anything more than watch her deteriorate when there ""was nothing else to do"" besides giving her the 2 standard prescription medications. 
After 2 years of trying our best within the framework of conventional medicine, something inside me continued to feel as if there had to be something more. After continued research I came across the work of Dr. Bredesen and the ReCode protocol to reverse Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
I felt shock, in disbelief, hopeful that there is actually a way to prevent and reverse mild stage of AD- things never heard in public or taught in school. However, I was also angry at myself, the medical community, and the pharmacy and medical school system that I didn't find this information soon enough and that I was not taught this during school. From then my journey began, and I understood more about what functional and integrative health medicine was and it led to many discoveries. 
However, God had plans that took me through various journey and pain I never could imagive. I found this research a bit late as my mom who was diagnosed with AD in 2018 was already in the moderate stage, and the ReCode protocol is really to prevent AD in the early stage, and she continued to deteriorate. In the meantime, my older brother (and my only sibling) was diagnosed with gastric cancer in Feb 2020. Even though we included integrative health and functional medicine interventions with chemo and surgery, he passed away in Oct 2022. Then my Mom passed away almost 3 years later; this July of 2025.
Throughout this journey, I knew I had to share this possibility of healing with others. I want to empower other families of the knowledge and access to paths that can actually heal their loved ones or themselves. However, I have been fighting my own mental battles as I feel sadness, like a failure and a combination of emotions and blockages as my mom and brother could not be saved, and that I didn't know this information earlier. 
I'm trying to look forward, accept what is, and live into my purpose of empowering others."

I lost my father on November 28 2021. I got sick with covid at that time and continued to the long covid for 2 more years. I was a healthy person until this point. Had a lot of strange symptoms that no one can do anything about and thought it was in my head. On July 16 2022, I lost my beautiful, vibrant 25 year old daughter Amanda. She was hit by a drunk driver. She left behind my 9 year old handsome grandson Alex that I now have custody of. He is my life. I thought that was the end of my life and all symptoms got even worse due to grief. I started researching and incorporating holistic remedies and peptides into my regimen. I started feeling some good results. My health was actually improving and finally I found boulder longevity and they continued to guide me. I have come a long way and feel like my younger self. I would love to educate and help people in these kind of situation.

People didn't expect this from me - I was an executive assistant and part-time plus-size model at the time I was in school.  When I started my studies and began building my career while still working fulltime, I was under a lot of stress. My anxiety increased as a result of several traumatic experiences - In a span of 5 years, I lost 3 of my brother back to back, had one brother headed towards prison and another brother fighting a lifetime addiction to crystal meth.  I also got married, ended up gaining custody of my stepson due to his being physically abused by his stepfather and neglected by his birth mother.  Ended up learning he had Asperberger's autism before people knew more about the condition and it became mainstream.  My health started to detererioate and I gained more than 160 lbs.  My hormones were way off, I started having autoimmune issues and suffered from ovarian failure at the age of 27 years old.  Depression and hopelessness kicked in. If it wasn't for my stepson, I am not sure I would have stayed alive.  I wanted to get better so I could be a good mom and have energy to take care of him.  I was so poor at the time due to some issues with my husband at the time not keeping jobs and providing for the household.  In addition to the family stressors, there were severe financial stressors as well.  Our cars got reposessed, house went into foreclosure and we had to go to the food pantry for food.  Some days I had to choose between feeding myself and feeding our son.  I always chose my son.  So my metabolism began to slow down more and because we couldn't afford ""healthy"" food, we relied alot on carbohydrates and cheap foods like ramen noodles, bread, and peas and carrots for some vegetables.  I was embarassed and disillusioned yet stayed in that marriage until my son was 16 years old.  The year prior my father passed away and my mother was suffering severe mental health issues.  When I went on my own, I began to read about nutritional healing, the nervous system and other herbal remedies to re-calibrate the adrenal system.  I was astounded about the progress I made by following a nutritional regimine, incorporating some yoga and herbal supplementation.  I lost more than 60 lbs and was on a great path of healing.  I also learned the importance of emotional boundaries.  I ended up changing my career to project management and business process improvement also improving my income.  However, 6 months later, I was laid off and re-entered poverty.  Not to mention got involved in another relationship that promised help and security, but he ended up leaving and moving out of state.  I spent the next 18 mos alone and trying to find my way.  I was able to gain a new position with a new company within 3 months, but it took one year to rebuild what I lost.  At the end of 18 months, I felt great! Was attending church, working, saving money, paying off debts from my previous marriage and trying to find a way to get back into school to obtain my masters degree in clinical psychology and theology.  Met a new man, was swept off my feet.  We moved in, got married and then the demons came out.  I found myself in a domestic violence situation.  I regained 50 of the 60 lbs I lost and he never let me live that down.  I went from an amazing woman in his eyes to being constantly verbally abused and eventually financially abused.  He was cruel, intolerant and unforgiving, but expected me to be submissive, kind and to never question him.  I found solace in adopting and taking care of dogs.  He physically abused the dogs.  Then his verbal and financial abuse started to escalate to physical abuse and eventually attempts to physically restrain me from leaving the house.  I was in a nightmare and my financial situation became critical.  I finally left, but had the heartbreak of not having any residential environment that would allow me to take my dogs with me.  I had to leave them behind but was blessed with women who were anonymously supporting me to help me transition out of my abusive environment.  I had 2 dogs in boarding that was being paid for by an anonymous donor and one friend who took in my other dog.  It took me a year, but I was able to re-unite with my dogs (who I have all but one to this day. And the only reason I don't have her now is because she passed away).  I also learned that when you are fleeing a domestice violence situation as a women with mid-high level income, you sadly do not qualify for many of the financial supports that are available to women with lower incomes.  In transition, especially when you are also a victim of financial abuse, the government wants your paystubs and expenses and well, because of income limits, you don't qualify even if your bank account is at zero.  Additionally, there are very few domestic violence shelters that also take animals. This is when I learned about the gaps in social services for middle-high income women who wish to transition with their support animals.  For survivors, the support animals are critical to helping the healing process.  Today, I am married to a very kind man.  I have all of my animals.  I make a very good income (but still have enormous levels of debt from my past marriages, so still struggling but rebuilding slowly) and live in a nice home.  However, the trauma never leaves.  I have a deep rooted fear of losing it all again, especially in this economy and want to hedge the odds in my favor.  I also learned the incredible healing power of herbs, nutrition and exercise for emotional and physical healing. I have since lost 95 lbs of the weight I gained and am working on losing the last 80 lbs.  Organic food, water and supplementation has healed my autoimmune disorder, my depression, and positively affected my weightloss.  I want to help domestic violence survivors and their companion animals with wholistic healing as well as provide transitional housing and shelter where they do not have to be separated."

I am the founder of the Successful Aging Academy and want to expand my knowledge and service offerings
Good morning, I have been doing healing work since 2004. I do not use social media. I have kept it very small and worked through one metaphysical store. After I bought my house, I took a job managing a bank and running my business on the side. Due to unfortunate event events I lost my job in April and heaven living business. My partner of 13 years husband diagnosed with stage three cancer, and my Unemployment has just run out. I run off in referrals for my business and I am maxing out my clients. I’ve just taken out a loan from my 401(k) to pay for this course and I’m looking at the last bit for $397. What lights me up is the new biophysics, the way sunlight works at the body mitochondria, etc. I feel like I need to be a functional medicine coach in order to really utilize this information. I do have a background in veterinary medicine so I do have a good understanding of medical. I’m looking to make a practice for spiritual, functional medicine, bio physics, and frequency. I would love to talk to you.
Looking to help my daughter heal
I want to help all these sick people around me who keep going to the same doctors and not getting help.
"Hi! My name is Michelle Marie Kuna. I go by Michelle, Michelle Marie, (or Chelle for my closest friends). I turn 50 on December 22nd! I have always loved anything to do with health, physical, mental, & emotional well being as well. I've  always been passionate about healing, as well as alternatives to our modern day medical ""system"" which keeps most people stuck in a loop with little hope for true healing. I am here because I would love to incorporate the knowledge I accumulated from my own experience & studies, along with  the generations  of old-world  knowledge which my parents taught me with modern scientific approaches. Iam here investing today in my future. I am passionate about health, healing, recovery, alternative medicine, integrative & wholistic healthcare. I am passionate about the body's ability to heal & restore itself to full health. I am a true believer in the miracles our bodies are capable of: rejuvenation & true restored health & wellness! ""Physician, heal thyself!"". 
I am looking forward to helping my own self in my health & wellness journey as well as helping others. I have longed to be a practitioner of sorts, within the alternative medicine arts. I am excited for this opportunity I am gifting myself. I believe I am in alliance with my life's purpose & goals. I am excited & looking forward to learning, developing, & utilizing my own wealth of knowledge coupled with everything these courses have to offer. I am grateful to be here & grateful for the knowledge I am about to acquire, along with all the support which comes with it. Happy healing! 💖"
"I am hoping to heal others and heal myself in the process. I've been a nurse for 20 years, passionately giving my all for a profession that continued to let me down.  Healthcare as a business prevents nurses from truly knowing their patients and helping them get to the root cause of their problems. I hold 3 degrees, Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), Master of Science in Nursing-Education (MSN), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).  I sought these degrees to have a greater voice at the table for decision making.  What I realized is that as you climb the ladder of healthcare, it becomes less about quality patient care/patient outcomes, and more about reducing the cost of care, and avoiding unnecessary ""waste"" of care. I served the profession and my patients as a nursing professor for 8 years.  During that time, my body became weak, my skills became less refined and outdated, and my spirit lost its zest for nursing.  I burned out from the business of academia and healthcare.  I decided to switch toward public health and took a Director of Nursing job at the local senior care center.  That turned out to be more cost cutting and poorly staffing for the most vulnerable elderly in my community.  I was faced with a constant state of conflict with the Administrator regarding quality competent care standards to uphold.  One week in July 2024, mold was discovered in the facility and I worked diligently to get professional mold mitigation. The administrator fired me for overstepping my role in protecting the residents....unbelievable and disheartening.  I sought justice with a lawyer for wrongful termination, and got a sizeable settlement from them. My heart was broken as a nurse and I have been working diligently to mend and recover.  I'm ok with not working bedside nursing, however, I still want to help people improve their health and find the root cause of pain, inflammation, fatigue, weight gain, and moodiness. Im currently working in the ER but my body is hurting and the stress level is high.  I have a lot of self-doubt lately which is not typical for me and is directly related to the trauma of wrongful termination, burn out in academia, and a back injury while lifting a patient. Im having a difficult time reading the lessons and getting knowledgeable about a new area of practice. Even my ER education is difficult for me to review to remain competent in current practice. I have a therapist and a wellness coach and this is helping."
I have T2D and now have experience I would like to share with others. Reading blood work specifically is essential to make it more professional.
I have a daycare and a doula business I feel that I work so much and I’m trying to find ways to work smarter and less. I’m overwhelmed and I have no time for me or my family
As a midwife, i see clients with other issues and I would like to be better prepared to help them
My husband has AD and we are both retired but I own a sittsperfect.com Posture company. Being in the middle of Bredesen Protocol we fell into the huge costs of FM reading our lab work. 4-500 a session. Chasing supplements now and got into TMS instead. We're also about to chase down ultra sound for AD. His GM told him to go to a good neurologist and get kisuna yet hes a APOE4X2 ..thanks FM !  That is where I stopped using him. Tms doesn't really change things. Getting on with me ..I'm a full time caregiver and getting somewhat exhausted. I'm a PTA by trade. So having only time to want to understand Lans.
"In order for me to practice legally in the USA (once I have a green card), accreditation in this field is vital.  Your affiliation with ICAHP and others is reassuring.  
Certification is paramount to assure a patient that they can trust that you’re schooled and capable of helping them.
Also, I always love learning (you only stop when you die) and am looking forward to learning from you in all things integrative!"
I have been looking at this addition to my personal training and nutrition coach certifications for a long time. I am interested in increasing my knowledge of how to support teens and young female athletes, especially in a growing world of comparison and body image issues. I want to focus on sports performance, but also help athletes find joy and success in the sustainable and healthy way to do so.
Nutrition
the rest of the story.  MSN did not complete the education.  Need the Functional side.
I am a Clinical Trichologist and hair & scalp health enthusiast who is passionate about helping clients get to the root cause of their hair and scalp issues. I am looking to incorporate integrative health and functional medicine principles into personalized protocols that are practical and effective in meeting clients needs as they journey towards building self confidence, self love and seeing beauty in their overall well being through proper hair and scalp health practices.
A friend sent me the link and thought it looked like a good fit for me.
This has always been a passion of mine
My journey into integrative health started at my husband’s bedside. He’s a Bishop and lifelong musician who has survived 4 heart attacks and 2 strokes, and now lives on multiple medications. For years I’ve been his advocate—asking questions, researching side effects, pushing for answers, and trying to see the whole picture of his health, not just a list of diagnoses. Through that process I discovered integrative health and functional medicine and realized how much root-cause, lifestyle, and nervous system work was missing from our care. Investing in the Integrative Health & Functional Medicine Coach Certification feels right because it gives structure and science to what I’ve already been doing—supporting my family, church, and community through crisis. I feel called to help caregivers, ministry leaders, and “strong friends” move from burnout and survival into true, whole-person health, using both my lived experience and the tools this certification will provide.
I want to delve deeper into treating autoimmune issues and be able to read labwork
I have found the practice of medicine is not practicing health and I would like to help others understand the information needed for their own health.
Well Sarah, hello it’s very nice to meet you. My entire life I have been into “how can I feel better” my PCP jokes with her interns that I pushed her for 10 years to send me to every doctor and specialist until I found out the real problem which I did, I am allergic to every sugar, or sugar substitute, with one exception maple sugar. Then I learned that vegetables turn into sugar so my entire life I was doing everything wrong and now that I figured that out and stopped the Thyroid medication and started using  a myriad of supplements, ionic foot baths, PEMF therapy, red light therapy  and Colloidal extracts life is radiant and my brain actually works, I have happy life giving energy. I actually use the same approach with my dog and no one believes he is 10 years old, if I could manage the arthritis better I would call it 100% success but that I am still trying to figure out. I have done many things in my 53 years of life, I have been in healthcare finance, data analytics, behaviors analysis, and a marriage and family therapist. I currently work on the 988 suicide prevention line and tutor children privately. The idea of being a a functional medicine practitioner aligns with my view on life and friends area always asking me with to do this is the logical next step. I also want to move out of the country so having an online business is the end goal. I have never been married I don’t have kids, I consider everyone I come into contact in a way that I can influence as family member.  So lets get this party started :)
I'm very interested in health and I want to help people. I am a certified Life Coach but not currently practicing.
"I worked Emergency Medicine for many years. Also done triaging for the past five years. People need answers not a quick fix with another pill, while they are getting sicker and sicker. 
I have a passion to help people. To understand the ins and outs of their disease, and how to help them live a life  that brings them freedom in their mind and body."
I love Medicine
I work for the NHS in the UK and just feel I could be doing more
I love learning and expanding upon the knowledge I already have and saw this as the perfect opportunity to learn to my heart’s content:) I really want to focus on the integrative functional certification first, but it’s nice knowing that I also have so many other options.
I am going through health problems
Just a nurse wanting to learn more
"I hold a Bachelor's degree in Healthcare Management, with a Minor in Gerontology. 
I'm looking to assist individuals move beyond the ""short-sided"" Traditional health model, which focuses on treating health conditions and symptoms, with standardized medication and surgery, while often failing to address health and wellness at the source. Traditional medicine excels at managing acute conditions, while functional medicine emphasizes prevention and long-term wellness by exploring the underlying factors contributing to illness.
I'm interested in functional health which addresses the root causes of illness through a personalized, holistic approach that considers genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. 
My areas of interest are: Healthy Aging, Weight loss, Hormonal Imbalance, and Inflammation control."
I worked in the medical field as a medical assistant for over 16 years.  I left 5 years ago to work from home part time to be available more for my family.  I had always been in to “natural” type things, even while in medicine.  But about 4 years ago, I opened my eyes to a lot of things about the medical system that made me never look at it the same again.  I changed many of beliefs and stances on things.  I’ve spent the last 4 years doing tons of research on the body and natural healing practices.  As my children are getting older, I’ve started to think about what could be “my thing”.  Something I’m passionate about that could provide my family with more income.  It honestly did not cross my mind to do this. I have been actually researching machines like the Hocatt and Refire-03 with the thought of investing in one to do a start up, so I knew I wanted to do something related to health and natural healing.  It seemed almost a sign from the divine that I came across your post on Facebook.  I’m very excited for this training and the opportunity to help people discover the healing powers within their body.
"I go by Nkee (N.K.). I work as a nurse care manager in a federally qualified health center (FQHC). We are a primary care provider that sees insured, uninsured, undocumented, and anyone in between. I spend my days returning calls to patients, discussing labs results, listening to the symptoms and triaging over the phone and in-person among other things. 
What pulled me to say yes to your ad was the possibility of understanding lab results even better. I am also a certified nurse coach and have been trying to set up my business for a while. I was hoping that delving more into the results of everyday labs would help me to get a job in the health coaching which I do at work. and maybe help me better define my niche as a Nurse Coach. 
I will be away from work for 12 weeks (out of the country) and was hoping to use this time to think through and set up and try out something that might move me forward. I really love coaching, but I am not sure why I haven’t been able to move forward more than I have."
Look for a different career that’s not so stressful
I’m in my eighth year as a practicing Acupuncturist but I've felt like I wanted more education in this realm of helping people navigate their specific questions as an intermediary when it comes to labs and things like that. I've been wanting to find a training like this but everything I researched was never the right fit or it was the wrong timing. I'm happy to have found this and I'm enjoying how well organized it is and it feels very supportive navigating it all so far.
Later
I’m a speech- language pathologist and absolutely love my career. I have not worked since 2020 because I’ve had three beautiful children since then, and have been focusing on raising them. I love helping people, enjoy learning, and researching. I’m always looking to further my education, and knowledge and felt that this was a great opportunity.  God’s calling.
I am a functional MD in Germany looking to promote my expertise to more clients
"I have always been interested in solving medical issues by natural means. My mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer when I just graduated high school. I was devastated when she only lived a year afterwards. She was a Nurse and I couldn't wrap my head around why she couldn't heal herself, like she helped hundreds of her patients. She was the one who 1st introduced me to homeopathic medicine. She would always say: ""God designed our bodies to heal naturally, if we just give it the right environment & nutrients to thrive in!"" I went on with my life after her passing, had a family of my own and passed down the same remedies my mother taught me to my daughters. However, something has always been knowing gnawing at my heart deep down - that my true calling is to help others heal naturally. I need to share more and truly help more people solve their complex health issues and connect the dots for them; especially since traditional doctors often leave people more clueless about their health and therefore they feel stuck and obligated to start down that dark path of big pharma - on meds for life!"
I have been a nurse for 23 years and have seen such a need in education, disease prevention, and true caring practitioners
Im a family nurse practitioner currently working in dermatology.  Id like to do functional medicine on the side.
"Im curious if I should still be in the course bc when I bought it I didn’t realize there was 3 levels. For me it wasn’t the money but the time and energy at this time in my life. If you think it’s appropriate to move forward knowing that I will not invest in level 2 and 3 then please let me know. Otherwise I request a refund. 

I’m a counselor and this would enhance my mental health & somatic healing practice."
I have been going to Functional Doctor for over a year and have done alternative medicine for my family for about 15 years. I am a mom who wants to get in the driver seat and learn this information firsthand to better help my family.
Healing my chronic illness
"I have been a practicing active registered nurse in multiple States with my bachelors of Science in nursing for the last 17 plus years. I currently live in Mansfield Texas. I'm originally from Maui, Hawaii and went to nursing school at Winona State University in Winona Minnesota. After graduation, I lived in Southern California for a while and in Webster Texas near Houston. I then moved back to Minnesota. After my divorce from a 10 year relationship with a narcissistic man, and having two boys with paternity inherited adhd, dyslexia and dysgraphia, I started struggling with my health majorly. When I would seek answers by medical providers, I would be told that ""everything looks fine"" as per my blood work, yet I would still severely struggle so much in my day today activities and responsibilities including holding down a nursing job because I had always been the primary breadwinner of the family while taking care of my boys who had evident struggles with no answers or diagnoses at that time. I ended up spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars trying to figure out why I was having these health issues on my own without any clear direction. I attempted to complete the Dr pompa program and I have access to that research but I don't quite know how to leverage it into my current nursing practice. I have always held fear about branching out because I don't want to get in trouble by the board of nursing by going outside my scope. However, I have always felt like I am capable of doing more for myself and for my patients. I have always felt like a practitioner at heart, but have not desired to go back into the Western medicine world to get my nurse practitioner license. And I've had a lot of unanswered questions related to the practice of incorporating holistic health coaching, or functional Health medicine or integrative Health practice into my nursing profession. And wondering if I need to keep them separate, and how to do that properly to avoid legality issues down the road. On May 8th 2024, I stepped out and decided to form my own LLC called Graceful Aging Now in the state of texas. I am calling myself a transformational holistic health solution and wellness coach, also author and speaker because I currently am in a chapter in a book about proverb 31 women, entrepreneurs in the marketplace trying to make a difference on a greater scale for God. I am a brand ambassador of a neutral wellness company and an affiliate to things like a mushroom company, but I have had to learn a through z and starting a company and even being a coach and trying to harness that skill and get clients with fear holding me back because I don't want to get in trouble for doing this because I'm a registered nurse. I don't want to put my license in jeopardy. Anyways, I am holistic health bench because I take different nutrients and supplements myself, and I do certain things to feel better amidst my current yet improved struggles. I feel like there's only so much I can do as a nurse or as a wellness coach, and I would love to be able to interpret lab results without being a medical provider or insinuating that I am in any sort of way. Currently I'm practicing as a private pediatric nurse as my bread and butter, and I recently hired a virtual assistant to help me with some content creation but I'm really at a standstill. I created my own website which I'm not completely satisfied with, I have business cards but I really haven't put myself out there into the community because I have these fears holding me back on what exactly I am and I'm able to do for them without jeopardizing my nurse license, etcetera. I have heard a lot about functional Health coaching or integrative medicine, but I wonder how a nurse like me can incorporate this into the practice. Anyways, I saw your video and decided to take again another risk of learning and branching out. But I'm often skeptical, and I need quite a bit of hand-holding especially in the beginning and I really need to get clarity on what I have signed up for with you. Today, I was researching that the American holistic nurse credential incorporation is the only national accredited certification program in holistic nursing and nurse coaching. I am wondering if I could sit for the exam for either or both of these after taking your course that I purchased today? I look forward to hearing from you soon, I'm excited yet Leary and a bit fearful but continuing to put one step forward and faith that God has led me to create such a company to help people on a wider and more holistic skill that can actually help them in life more than I have been as a standard Western medicine nurse. Thank you for reading this, let me know if you have any questions. Hope to connect soon, Julie Meyer, RN, BSN, PHN"
Will to always learn new things
I was in the medical field years ago. My husband is currently battling stage 4 cancer from a holistic with assist of western medicine. It is working. I want to learn more to assist him in his journey
The price of your program
I've had many health challenges.  Little good advice from physicians.  Have done a lot of searching for reasonable answers  and course of action.  Also, they might be phasing out my job .
I’m here today because healing work has been part of my life for many years. As an LMT, Surgical Assistant, CMA, nursing student, cosmetologist, esthetician, and CEO of Serenity, I’ve dedicated almost 20 years to serving my community through my own practice. My journey has taught me the value of compassion, resilience, and transformation. Investing in this certification felt like the next natural step — a way to deepen my skills, expand my ability to help others, and continue honoring the calling I’ve carried in my heart for a long time.
I’m a newly licensed and certified nurse practitioner with a background in naturopathy. I would like to be able to combine functional medicine, concepts, coaching, and consul ting as I move forward in my career.
"I'm 53 and have been in healthcare compliance for since I was 23  and seen read the impact of diseases in clinical ( Health Information) records and operative notes, now I run an online herbal business, and there are so many ill persons that I am limited to help due to lack of knowledge. I want streamlined information to build out a business that is profitable, changes life, credible and create generational wealth. I want to also be able to use preventive care to safely heal myself and my family. I am also into spiritual healing and would like to integrate functional coaching and spiritual coaching as I believe they ""hold hands."" I am very passionate about alternative health sources and would like this legacy to pass on to my children. I believe this is my calling for the this phase of my life."
Wanting to take further steps in developing my skills in coaching to utilise in my career
Located to Florida where difficult to practice my integrated holistic therapies where I used to work with Drs previously, and so want more papers certificates as a 'coach'
I’ve been an RN working with functional medicine for well over 25 years. I find the holistic approach and functional or integrative medicine  Very interesting. I believe in treating the cause not just the symptoms. I have a small Infusion practice currently and I use my nutritional IV skills and my certified nutrition specialist Knowledge on a daily basis. I wanted to learn more about functional medicine. A doctor that wants me to join her practice wanted to get more involved with the functional and integrative side of medical practice. I thought this would be a good foundation for me so that I can Actually counsel patients  myself.
I'm a chiropractor. I've been practicing for 8 years, and I recently started incorporating functional medicine into my practice. I am still in the learning process and eventually want to pursue functional medicine full time. I saw this website and thought it would be a good resource to help me learn more about functional medicine and how to apply what I've learned so that I can help patients optimize their health.
I want a general understanding of the clinical aspects in functional wellness coaching.
I have hashimotos, so I have been told a few years ago.  I have went to several Drs and have had 3 dismiss me from their practice and just a few days ago this has happened again.  That is why I am really late in getting this done here as I am trying to decide what to do with my life.    After feeling sorry for myself I need to get on with this class so I can not only help myself, but others that I know are in the same place I am.
I am an RN. Working toward retirement and want to work from home.
I have struggled with gut/hormone/fertility issues and seen many of my friends and family struggle with their health. I want to gain knowledge to help them.
I am a professional counselor and I want to build on the services that I provide my clients
I am a n RN and an ADON at a retirement village with varying levels of care. I am wanting to switch to remote work some time in the near future. I also am certified in Reiki3 and Quantum Touch 3rd level. I am wanting to incorporate a more holistic view of nursing into my career.
I've had a hime kitchen apothecary for year I want to share my passion, informed
I teach nursing (EdD) and practiced in ER and ICU. Now, I'm starting to have health issues and research shows me functional med is where I want to go, but I want to know more. So this is more to help myself and family than to become a practitioner or coach.
I’m an RN, currently working in the neuro and trauma ICU. I come from a background where my parents are both nurses as well, but my mom has always taken the holistic approach and eastern medicine despite working in the western medicine field. I’ve always been interested in learning about health and would like to actually help people instead of going through hospital protocols like you mentioned. Please help me grow and learn the correct way to heal others
I’m doing well with my business but want to become completely independent
I've been a medical assistant for over 20 years and left the field burnt out. Now all I want it to help others heal
I have been an athletic coach, health coach, and sports therapist for over 20 years and always want to learn more and gain more knowledge
I am a perimenopausal woman who has utilized GLP-1 medication in combination with nutritional changes and weight training to conquer high blood pressure, chronic fatigue, and inflammation. I want to help other women like me who may be trapped in a demoralizing diet culture to find a healthy pathway
I’ve taken a few FM courses and wanted to try yours out
I have done this twice.  I feel like I keep starting over.  I have had a thyroid issue for 20 years.  Have had 3 Physicians dismiss me from their practise.  Just today I had another tell me regardless of my issues we had to wait 6 ms before we update my compound even though the last test that was done in September was just a little abnormal wanted to wait to see what it would be come March.  I feel I must learn how to confer about these people and help others to be able to as well. I feel like the medical community has forgotten they  are in the caring business.  I was formerly an LPN, so I understand the issues on both sides of this issue.  I loved my job and love caring for others.  I have been a caregiver for several families after leaving the hospital setting.   I an looking forward to going forward here.  Thank you for listening.
I’ve studied all the spiritual stuff, not it’s time to integrate the science
I have always had a strong interest in holistic medicine and I enjoy helping others improve. I come from a business background but feel I need a career change and want to do something that is meaningful.
I love to learn
I am an oncology registered nurse navigator. And I want to broaden my knowledge base to offer more medical coaching! I am passionate about serving others and sharing my knowledge and experience to help others live their healthiest lives possible!
Desire to have more knowledge to provide better care and education to my clients.
Interested in alternative medicine and holistic lifestyle
I feel that I came into this incarnation as a teacher/healer and am wanting to do some spiritual counseling . The more you know the more you can help people.
I have illnesses like this
I want to understand how functional medicine works / how to interpret labs and what information to share with people in my life.
My mom is chronically ill and we are so tired of the medical pill mill. I want to gain more knowledge in functional medicine for her and for myself.
I have an extensive background in medicine as a critical care paramedic and a BS in Psychology. Functional medicine has always been something I believe in because the human body is designed to work TOGETHER as a well-oiled machine. To look at just one organ is craziness when every hormone, enzyme, organ, tissue, etc. is made to work in tandem. I had to medically retire after an on the job injury as a career firefighter which left me empty and numb…without a REAL purpose. I knew I wanted to get back into the medical field but I’ve always been intrigued by mental health and how it affects our body as a whole, hence the degree in psychology. I’m starting a masters program this summer but I enjoy HELPING PEOPLE! This seems right up my alley so I figured why the hell not? So here I am.
Hello my name is Amanda, but in the spiritual community I am known as Amunta, which I prefer. Personally, when I saw your ad these are some issues I am trying to heal within myself and am searching to how to. I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism 17 years ago and taking the same medication being told my labs were normal for many years. I am exhausted gaining weight and tired of the medical system. I decided to consult my friend who is a nutritionist and have been detoxing from my medication for 3 months now as I believe it was doing more harm than good. I am on a supplements protocol now working to get better, but still gaining weight and suffering from adrenal fatigue.  I also have had severe gut issues and chronic constipation for just as many years, and feel I have tried many methods but nothing has worked to date. I am a certified yoga and breathwork instructor which is my passion and calling and leaving a job no longer aligned to transition full time into something that feels more aligned. I am taking your course to first heal myself and become a living testament! Then I would like to help others while pairing this with yoga and breathwork.
I have aspired to get into online health coaching for quite some time.  I have elderly parents 3 hours from me and need to create some flexibility into my way of earning income.  After 20 years in my line of work, I love what I do but am tired of trading lots time for little money.  My credentials include: BS Business Administration, Nationally Certified Pilates Teacher, Licensed Spiritual Healer,  Certified Raindrop Technique Specialist, Certified Aroma Freedom Practitioner and Z-Health Trainer.  I have had a brick and mortar Pilates Studio in my home since 2012.   I have always wished I had medical training, but am now 58 so it does not make sense in terms of time and money to go back to school for 6 years.   I am an avid student and would like to bring all my knowledge together to offer a very comprehensive health and wellness program with life changing coaching. I hope your program leads me there and gives me the confidence to speak publicly with possibly a podcast, online videos and marketing.   I know I know a lot but I need help communicating it  . My website, www.betsywalkerwellness.com needs and update as I never launched the coaching offerings listed even after completing many expensive coaching programs.  I did do an online Health and Wellness Summit in 2020 where I got out of my comfort zone interviewing 25 experts on natural healing and health remedies.  I was so stressed out and unhappy with how I presented and the outcome that I lost all momentum and confidence.
Functional medicine saved my life
"I have been a nurse for about six years. I initially went into the medical field because I wanted to help and heal people. I became interested in functional medicine. However, the schooling it takes to get there seems excessive to be a provider. I decided integrative medicine is the way to go and I can learn a lot faster and apply it more quickly in gaining more experience and getting my feet wet. 
My journey included plant medicine and shamanistic practices, which has led me to understand the link between the subconscious mind and wellness along with good nutrition and diet. I have since learned how to do energy work, and have learned that labs and other markers are vital in understanding underlying causes of illness aside from the subconscious and fight or flight/traumas. Learning as much as I can from others that have put this into practice is what brings me here."
Hi! My name is Jalayne and I worked as a RN for almost 20 years. I actually surrendered my nursing license because I was so disheartened by the actual job itself, working in a hospital and then in LTC. I grew to resent the “business of healthcare “ because I saw and felt that the companies I worked for placed profit above the patients and staff also. I want to serve my patients in a better way, in which I can feel like I am truly making a difference in their lives. This may be the perfect fit!  Of course, I am excited but nervous because I have always done bedside nursing, but I feel like functional medicine could make a profound difference in people’s lives, which has always been my main goal. Excited to meet you and also to learn everything!
Building out the functional medicine part of my practice
Learning new career.
Well I would like to help to helping myself feel better. I am currently going through menopause and I would love to know what my blood test results are telling me about my body. And the. I plan on helping others.
I transitioned from modeling to personal training I also do personalized stretching and trigger point fascia massage…
I got help with my health from a functional medicine coach and I now want to help others to wellness.
I suffer from these types of illnesses and tired of getting ghosted by all these doctors on my blood work “being normal”, so I want to help myself and others get well without traditional western medicine. But more natural eastern medicine approach. Plus, make money along the way.
I’ve done a little bit of everything! I’ve been a cosmetologist, CNA, medical assistant, phlebotomist, pharmacy, assistant , and settled intoretail management for over 20 years.  In June 2024, I opened Elm Street apothecary a small retail shop in a mall what’s the goal of giving people on the opportunity to explore natural herbs and remedies for themselves.  My original goal wasn’t to help find remedies, but to give them a space to have more control over their own well-being in a natural way.  As a 48-year-old woman who has gone through menopause, has hyperthyroidism, and anemia, I connect great with my customer base. It’s been well received and my biggest hurdles are that I didn’t allocate from marketing and the growing pains of being in year two of business.  I thought this program would be a good fit as a way to better support my customers and their own personal journeys and possibly supplement online my own income.
I’ve helped myself get my health back using research and functional medicine methods and have helped family members do the same. I’ve figured it’s time to go more in depth and get some credentials.
After years of gaslighting and ghosting from doctors on my health, my blood work is normal, you’re too young to have these issues, etc. I want to help myself andothers
I was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease M.S. and have been on a healing journey since. I have been living in a world of functional medicine since. I know what has worked for me and what has not.  I also have a long history in healthcare, where I worked as a Surgical Assistant, and during my healing journey, I became a Certified Nutritional Coach and Certified Reiki Master. I also completed my Master's Degree IN Healthcare Administration.  I feel that, with my background, my education, and my love of finding the root cause of illness, I am a good fit for this program.
"I was raised by a wild pack of hippies in the 70’s, and I have been studying nutrition all of my life, and when I say that, I mean since childhood, spurred by curiosity and my Dad’s obsession with organic foods and supplements. Friends and family know this, so when they're experiencing general malaise, they ask if I recommend anything.

I was a very motivated workaholic until about five years ago. I couldn't make the drive home (one mile) without falling asleep. I was falling asleep on my feet. It turns out hypothyroidism and menopause were hitting me at the same time. Then Covid happened and I lost my insurance and primary care team. The brain fog and exhaustion were too much. I couldn't advocate for myself or do any research that would help me.

I moved across the country to North Carolina and haven't found a medical care team with any curiosity or ability to think outside the box. I've been on an anti-inflammation diet, doing red light therapy, and trying a number of things to get better. I've seen progress.

Recently, I did a Function blood test and discovered I have Hashimoto's and likely lupus, as well as a high probability for cardiac arrest. This surprised me because I'm active and eat healthy. I was also low on omega-3s, which came as another surprise.

I want to have the tools to heal myself and others who are struggling where Western medicine is failing them."
I have been a nurse for 15 years. I've worked in the ER and various other departments in the hospital for the past six years. I have done hospice nursing for the past four years. I've done aesthetic nursing. I am a single mom and feel like I am burnt out and not getting to spend the quality time with my son that I would like I currently work for a doctor that has an integrative health practice along with his aesthetic practice. I don't have enough knowledge to be able to take care of patients reading through what you offer very much interest me. I am a 42-year-old woman beginning per menopause and feel like so many options are just to take hormone replacement therapy. I know there are other ways out there to take care of things. I know gut health is so important. I'd love to have a deeper understanding and be able to help other people that are in my situation
I want to learn more about how our bodies are connected with the earth to heal itself
My wife. She is sick. With so many of the things you mentioned in the trainings you offer. I don’t understand it and searching the Internet for understanding is impossible. She’s also incredibly advanced with all of this area of life and it’s something I want to be able to better support her on in her journey to better health. We freeze at the thought of how h things cost, from labs to protocols to just visits alone. I’m considering a second job because she can’t work and we need to get her help but insurance doesn’t cover this type of stuff.
I’ve been a pediatric occupational therapist for the past 25 years. This past year, my parents both suffered major illnesses my mom with pancreatic cancer level four who passed away within 30 days of diagnosis, and my dad suffered a massive stroke and then had turbo cancer of the bladder which ended his life in early February 2025. The profound loss of my parents have really changed my view of the medical community in how little support and help we were actually able to get to come up with solutions and Care that I felt was adequate. Well, I’m not a doctor. My mom was a nurse and I’ve always grown up in a medical minded household and I feel like we can do better and I want to be able to do better for the kids that I see for their parents that are also struggling, and I can clearly see that they have issues I want to be able to help all of them
I've worked in healthcare since 2007 and do not like the sick care model of only prescribing a pill and not addressing the root cause.
I am a primary care provider and I want to deepen and broaden my practice
I own a patented health formula through sound and visuals taking myself from disabled to where i am today. Leaning more
My own health issues I experienced as a teenager sparked my interest in how the body works and understanding the impact lifestyle has on health. My parents passing at a young age was devastating and pushed me further into exploring disease and ways to prevent majority of it. I just feel pulled to learn more and help people that don’t get personalized information to help themselves from the medical system.
I love to help inspire, educate and motivate others and also be a personal witness to others health success . I am amazed at how much of the desire to learn about remedies that heal from the earth are just beyond amazing and I want to be a part of this great preparation.
I’ve always wanted to study this field and it was affordable
I'm a RN who has been dealing with Hashimotos without any real solutions from the Dr. Just want to learn more for my own sake.
I am an RN working in corporate wellness and also have Hashimotos and would like answers for myself and to help my clients and friends
I am a RN in southern California with 20 years experience. I have long been interested in functional medicine but have found programs to be out of my reach due to cost. My specialty has been psychiatric nursing but I am burnt out on only being able to help stabilize people in crisis. I would much rather spend my energy helping people prevent and manage problems so that crises are minimized or never have to recur.
I treat a lot of skin issues that I feel need more than just laser and proper skincare.
Health is wealth!!
I am looking to better understand the comprehensive health terrain of my patients to improve my level of patient care
Been in health care for a long time need a flexible job
Currently in medical device sales with background in sports medicine and herbalism. The need for alternative approaches to medicine is why I’m here
I want to take care of my health first and foremost.  I learned I have Hashimoto's.  I'm also an educator and coach other teachers.  Later down the road I might be interested in starting my own business, but that's not my focus now.
Lately I've been really interested in how nutrition can affect your health and I've learned a lot and I would like to share that with other people and help improve their lives. And I know that this certification will take me even further in my knowledge in how to help people improve their health.
I am finally coming out of my cave to share my affinities and gifts in the healing arts with the world.
I’m a critical care nurse. Sell health and wellness and I’ve been interested in functional medicine. I would like to add this to my current business.
Autoimmune Disease
I have Autoimmune Disease
I just want to be home with my children and travel for now.
I have been a wellness coach for 20 yrs I am a self study type and I have already mastered so much information but would love credentials to match my knowledge. I have autoimmune disease myself and I’m super passionate about helping others heal holistically the way I am
I’ve been in healthcare for over 30 years and my desire is to see people living healthier lives with healthier lifestyles. I want to stop putting bandages on the cause and really help people to heal!
I’m a single mother who is looking for something that I can do from home. I have been looking for a long time trying to figure out what I can do to help people. I went to school to be a firefighter and due to family circumstances I had to quit. I’ve always been pulled to help. I’ve always been drawn to wholistic medicine. I read and research as much as I can because it’s something that I believe in.
I am a home health nurse who appreciates a whole health approach to medicine. I have had ideas to open a wellness center or clinic for some time. I want to incorporate naturopathic medicine into my practice.
More skills to serve with
Hi! I have been looking for a new career in wellness since my early retirement a few months ago. I am a big adept of nutrition, yoga and everything about holistic health. I am 58 years old, hold a bachelor’s degree and was a teacher for many years. I was born and raised in Canada but have been living in Florida for many years. I have extensively travelled around the world. I recently came back from a month in Southeast Asia which was another big eye opener of the sad health problems in the USA. I want to help people understand what they need to do to better their health and lives.
I just want extra knowledge for my work.
Having issues i wish I had the answers for when doctors aren't helping. So I'm hoping I get some answers and if I can help anyone else that's in the same situation would be great.
My daughter has autism and other health conditions (mold, lyme, severe gut issues) and ive been on journey to get her healthy the last few years and im so passionate about helping others get healthier and feel better
So many people that I work on in my Massage clinic are struggling with health issues related to food and nutrition I want to be able to opt for them extra options
I am a CNA and also a beginner coach and I love helping people and I just want to learn more. My goal is to go to Nursing school in the future.
not sure
I am a provider At Chiropractic Office
I’ve learned a lot on my own and would like to fill in the gaps
I'm an ICU RN and in short, nursing is hard especially since my interest is in natural health. I have coached a few people with MS, DM, Obesity and Cancer. I'm here because I want to build a practice to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, a practice that helps people live better, longer
I wanted to further my education and show off my skills and knowledge
I have always been fascinated by the health field and worked in several clinics as support staff. I always wanted to work in healthcare however I ended up working in education instead. I have taught in higher ed and love helping people, I even had a 5 year beauty business working to help clients feel better about themselves. After Covid and my partners cancer diagnosis I began to question regular medicine and seek holistic health practices for myself and partner and I regularly study this. I want to know more about lab tests and how to treat conditions without pharmaceuticals and I want to help others with this as well. I like talking to people and helping them find things to help themselves. For example, I found that probiotics work for seasonal allergies and I tell everyone about it! My dad found this in a medical journal and even my allergist never heard of this, just wanted me to take shots..no way! I just want more information for myself and to help others from a more informed perspective. I may delve deeper into further certifications but I’m not sure yet. I do have a good full time job it just does not bring a lot of joy, so if a second career comes from this that would be great, but at this time I’m doing it to learn!
I am an organizer, a yoga instructor as well and into health my whole life, looking to help my clients in a healthy way along with cleaning up their hoarding issues.  Looking forward to a new addition to our company.
Ive been battling chronic health issues all my life with no answer. With a nutrition background and still not being able to heal myself, I became weary and feeling like a fraud. Now, seeing a function nutritionist and naturopathic Dr, ive found that I was eating things my body was rejecting.. I don't want to coach people to do things that harm them. So, this is why I wanted to bring together a functional and mind opening approach to my clients.

This is something I’ve been interested in for awhile and I’m always trying to learn more
I paid for a functional medicine course years ago but was never able to navigate through the courses because it’s unorganized.  I never had the time to sit down and find the course materials, print, figure out the content, etc.  When I saw the content and organization of this program, I knew it would be a good fit that I could fit into my schedule.
I am an administrator for a nonprofit clinic.
I’ve been looming for a well organized and easy to follow functional medicine course.
Ive been learning frequency healing and want to help others
In the past 3 years, I have weaned myself off of 7 psychiatric medications, tramadol and kratom. Traditional medicine had failed me and no physician was able to help me with the physical withdrawal symptoms combined with the mental health problems stemming from tapering off all of the medication. After my body and mind were detoxed, I was able to build my system back up with several protocols and am now off all prescription meds, healthy and happy. I would like to help others recover from prescription abuse and addiction.
I’ve always thought that there’s other possibilities other than traditional western medicine and identifying illnesses and since a lot of diseases have an unknown ideology. Doctors don’t always really know the cause and they say auto immune disease automatically. I know that there’s something that is clearer that could help people go beyond their disease and that I could help them with and I work on peoples bodies and energy field in a spiritual energetic way and I know that using functional medicine will add more value to my services and add a holistic personalised approach.
"I love a good mystery!I’m an RN & worked in acute care settings (ED primarily - found my “heart home”  in pediatrics) for 25 years & then went back to school (PP/FNP)….. & kept on going to school … I love learning & then moved into teaching & eventually management & leadership (Dept Chair, Associate Dean, etc…  until I was done!) I Retired a year ago (the program was moving in a punitive direction). I have really tried to get into copywriting……but just can’t “love” it… have written & published a book “How  to Survive Your Final Semester in Nursing School & Move on to Save Lives” & started a Substack Newsletter “Notes from a Nurse: The first pulse you take…”…
Primarily I’m here because I love a good mystery… and everyone comes with their own story …& mystery…and it takes awhile to figure out what’s Really going on!”
Also… your description hit me and Spoke (tugged) at me…& I realized I was smiling as I filled in my credit card info…(don’t have expendable income (another reason I’m here)…. I feel GOOD about this Big decision… I do not want to diagnose & treat any more but would like to continue to use my critical thinking/triage skills & learn about the practices you described in the good, solid marketing… grabbed me & I couldn’t resist the upsells & the Pedi& self-care/resilience subjects."
I’m a nutritionist wanting to relaunch my holistic meal prep company I had pre COVID and I have celiacs and pcos and would like to help my health but more so heal and help others on their journeys
I am a 64 year old hospice RN and am burned out. I like helping people and want to continue my profession. I am having health issues that I feel like it is related to autoimmune disorders but Dr are not helping me. If I can learn to help myself I know I will be capable of helping others with the knowledge I attain.
Here to help humanity.
I spent 41 years in health care ,I have apoted 5 handicapble children and have worked in mental health because of family issues ,disfuntional family. But this is not a job but my calling in life.
I spent the last week in a hospital with my mom and realized how broken our healthcare system is. I’m looking to help my friends and family with guidance and support to help them live a long and active life.
Looking to change careers and hopefully make more money than I make now
Currently a nurse practitioner that worked in primary and felt frustrated not able to get down to root causes of the problem. I have worked in hormones the past year and am passionate about that and getting my patients to feel like themselves and balanced. I’m big into nutrition and physical exercise as well.
I have been a  RN  for 34 years and now teach Hospice nurses how to manage symptoms at end of life for patients who have a prognosis of 6 months or less. Sometimes they get better and don’t die despite their prognosis. I also do quality assurance performance improvement for a nonprofit company and love root cause analysis systems. I want to learn this method because it makes sense to me. I might possibly do health coaching in my retirement.
I am a radiation therapist that is now a certified palliative care aromatherapist and cbd specialist. I am program director for a hospice company that we are integrating holistic hospice programs into our practices. This will allow me and my team to expand our support to our patients and families and care partners
I’ve been a nutritionist and personal trainer for over 25 years. I have multiple degrees and certifications. But learning doesn’t stop. Your ad appeared and I figured why not. Maybe I learn something new.
Incorporating holistic therapy with my current nursing practice. I work with women and children and truly want to improve their overall health and wellness.
I feel like people in my life already come to me for help because of my nursing background but are seeking natural treatments so I am able to blend both and know when something can be taken care of at home or truly needs medical assessment.  I also custom formulate my own herbal tinctures and teas based on someone’s needs and glycerites and syrups for kids so I can combine supplements with herbs to address a problem.  I love doing this free of charge for my friends and family but it would be nice to have a side source of income and still be helping people.
Facebook technically brought me here. 😝 but the Facebook ad caught my attention because I suffer from *something* doctors say it’s POTS. Autoimmune diseases run rampant in my family. But doctors are no help in feeling better. I have also been through intense trauma in my life. I am on a soul and body healing journey and I’d love to know more to help myself. Having the ability to help others is just icing on the already delectable cake. I have always felt called to a higher purpose. Like I’m meant to do something great! Helping people makes me happy. It fuels my fire. I cannot wait to get started and be able to do so!
I want to learn your method for consulting
I just want to better myself and my family.  If I can help other as well, great!
I’m a physician assistant with 18 years of clinical experience. Unfortunately, due to health reasons, I had to go on medical disability 6 years ago. I am unable to return to my current position due to the pace and requirements expected to practice. I have worked in an an alternative health practice for a year and gained a great deal of insight into the practice and shedding light on the need to balance traditional medicine and alternative approaches. I am here to move forward so that I can continue to help others.
Myself and my family’s health issues very important to me. I have five children and a husband who are all dealing with different health issues, from things like Hashimotos to a Trigeminal Schwinoma brain tumor. I’m always trying to learn more so I can help my family live healthier and happier lives.
I got my Associates degree in Integrative Healthcare, but no coaching certs from it. Don't feel prepared enough to take clients at this point.
I’m a nurse, RN of 15 years, burnt out and tired. I’m also very much into functional medicine and root cause analysis. I try to teach/coach my patients, functionally, already so I feel this will only strengthen my skills. I’m also personally dealing with some autonomic dysfunction and going through a medical workup for that and hoping for answers soon. So if I can learn some thing to help myself along the way, that’s a win too!
I want to go back to working one-on-one and in small group settings again. For the past 6 years, I have stepped away from working in private practice, I had worked with women who were struggling with hormone imbalance and autoimmunity mostly. Then in 2019 I created and formulate for my supplement brand called Mixhers and that has been my full-time focus. Mixhers provides nutritional blends created to specifically support women through all ages and stages of their life. It has grown, and I am now finding I have more time available to go back to serving women in a more intimate setting again. I am excited to get a refresher and feel confident again with setting up an online practice, and to be able to read labs and create effective protocols, etc.. I am hoping this course can provide all of these tools and more. I am excited to dive in.
"Hi, Sarah! It is a pleasure to meet you! First, a big thank you for this opportunity! I'd like to introduce myself by telling you my story. I am an immigrant and came to the US when I was three. I joined the Navy right out of high school as a medic. I've always wanted to be a healer, even back then. After five years, I was at a major crossroads. Do I continue being in the military for another 15 years or do I do something else? Now, I originally wanted to be a doctor - that was my goal...but after considering the price and the time investment, I decided that I would pursue nursing, instead. So, I went to the local community college, which has a reputation as being one of the best in Southern California - and the entire country! It was tough, and for it ""only"" being an associates degree, it took a LOT longer than anticipated! I graduated in December of 2011 and have been working as a registered nurse since. I have worked in hospice, skilled nursing at a SNF and transitional care/rehab, LTAC, acute care, and now case management. I would like to tell you that I'm satisfied with the choice that I made...but that wouldn't be honest. I'm burnt out a lot of the time trying to care for people, and that affects me in my home life. My wife worked as a unit secretary for a SNF and now works as a financial records specialist at a hospice, so she knows nurses. It's ok, it pays the bills. But it is SOOO stressful!! I ended up being forced to take a year off beginning in December 20th of 2020. The reason? I found out that I had brain cancer, with an aggressive form called ""Glioblastoma Multiforme."" If you look that type of cancer up, it has a dismal survival rate of about 10%. My wife panicked - big time. Thank God it was operable! If it wasn't...well, I don't know if you would be reading this right now. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it was a wild ride, and I give ALL the credit to God for saving me! Evidently, He still wants me around to do more good on this planet. Unfortunately, as a result of taking so much time off work, I have accrued some pretty hefty debt that we are paying off and will likely continue to for the next decade. The past five years have really shown me just how broken the modern western medicine model really is! The response to the Covid-19 pandemic was HORRENDOUS in my personal opinion. It wasn't the virus that was killing people. It was the loneliness and depression that was induced by the lockdowns. It was loved ones dying alone at a nursing home. It were the poor students whose grades plummeted because they were not learning at the school in person! That was the line in the sand, when it finally hit me. I'm not helping people like I want to be! I see the same patient get readmitted, for the SAME reason, for the THIRD time! What are we as nurses doing to ensure that person does not end up back into our Emergency Department? No more!!! I have always believed in functional medicine and I HATE the modern Western medicine, big-pharma profiteering, a pill for every ill, SICK-care instead of ACTUAL HEALTH-care model!! I want EVERYONE to have abundant health!! I admire naturopaths that have been using herbs and plants to heal people, and it's worked for millennia! But I realize, too, that we do need SOME pharmaceuticals, too. Over the past 30 years, we have seen an exponential explosion in chronic diseases in our country - most of which I believe were preventable!! And it has caused wide-spread suffering and death! So, that is why I am so PASSIONATE about doing this! I want to be a HEALER, not just someone pushing pills at the bedside, or arguing with an insurance company on why patient needs such-and-such services! That's my story, Sarah. I wanted to write more, but I think for now, this should suffice. God bless you and your family this holiday season!"
"I’ve been studying healing, emotional and physical, for 40 years. I was a teacher and school counselor for 30 years and have had my office for 20 plus years. My focus has been on Energy Healing and Naturopathy. I’ve been a cancer coach along with many other certifications using German New Medicine which relates each specific cancer to an unresolved conflict/trauma.
My practice was interrupted by family problems. I’ve taken care of my 2 nephews after my sister died of cancer which also left my aging mother with Demensia in my total care. One nephew got paralyzed from a divr and the other had become a violent addict. They’re doing better now. But my husband has 2 cancers which I’ve been healing with natural remedies. They said he’d be dead in a year if no chemo or radiation. It’s been 1 1/2 years and he’s doing well. He also had a quadruple bypass and had heart failure. It has been very difficult to focus on my work and I totally stopped about 2 years ago.
Problem is that with so much focusing on others, I’m losing myself and am very bored. I’d like to get by to focusing on my life. I’ll be 80 next week but don’t feel it or look it. I’m not ready to throw the towel in. I need something interesting in my life. I’ve been supporting and feeding 3 men for years and it’s drained me financially so I’m thinking that I have so much education and many certifications I could get back to seeing clients. My son is a Chiropractor and I use the office I built for him. I was all over the world with both of my sisters going to cancer centers which cost me a mint so I do need the money. This is the first thing that interested me so I thought ‘Go for it’! So, we’ll see!"
I’m a retired paramedic supervisor.  Reading many of these stories, this was me.  I want to help.
I'm a Clinical pharmacist and want to branch out away from the big pharma and have the knowledge to offer alternative therapies and start a practice for chronic pain coaching
I am these women, this was my story and I want to help.
I’ve been sharing what I know about health and wellness holistic practices for years and want to have verification. Went to school to be a nurse and had to leave due to health problems
I love the body and helping shed a new light when it comes to healing. I was a massage therapist for 11 years.
"Grand Rising, Ms. Sarah! 
It's Julie from Wyoming here (finally)! 

A reminder of our previous conversations . . . I've been serving our nation's disaster survivors for 16 years with FEMA. What an honor it has been to work hard on their behalf to ensure they receive access to funds, resources and support during the worst time of their lives. 

When I returned from my last year-long deployment (there were many), my body and soul were depleted. With a vigorous schedule of multiple doctors and specialists appointments, I was unable to physically deploy for a long period of time. For several months, I worked remotely on special projects, re-writing training curriculum, creating new courses, providing support to my colleagues. 

Then, came the day when all federal employees were required to return to an office. Because I had been field staff all my career, there was no local office to return to. This meant I would need to move to headquarters in Washington, DC, or to one of the 7 regions in the nation, the closest being Denver. (if they had an opening). 

This was when I made the determination to leave FEMA on my terms before they dismissed me. None of us knew, during that chaotic time, what the outcome would be.

I entered into the ""reinvent myself"" stage at 64 years old. A frightening time of my life, to be certain! My desire to help others needed to take another form. This recent fall, my new tipi poles were being wrapped up to protect them from the winter snow prior to their grand entrance next spring. As I wrapped my arms around the stack to ensure the covering was completely surrounding them, I received a message. Those poles were to become part of a beautiful retreat for individuals to come learn about healing!"
I am an ICU nurse, I see first hand, every day, patients with issues getting brushed off because their labs are “normal”. I believe “normal” is a spectrum and I want to know more about it.
I work as a registered nurse at a hospital. I have been there 20 years and have realized healthcare is t healing people. It only makes money off of them. I want to truely help people heal the right way.
"Well, I am an LPN. Currently on ""hiatus"" In 2013 I went to Medical
Assisting School in Oregon. I was a CMA for 7 years. I loved it! I 
love helping people! I always have. I am from NY. Long Island actually. I am a people person. I'm a hugger. I'm a sympathy crier.
I love to talk, talk to my patients, find out what is really going on with them. I like to work in clinics. Because, there you get your return patients. Your ""regulars"" and you can establish rapport with them. You get to know them and their families. Anyway, you get the picture. I moved to Iowa in 2018. In August of 2020 I started LPN school. I felt at the time that I wasn't being allowed to do much as a CMA and my skills were being wasted. I had worked so hard, to become one in my late 40's and did so well. So, now I felt-well this is great, all I'm doing is taking blood pressures and doing medication reviews. So I went to Nursing School. It was TOUGH!!! It was SO HARD! I honestly don't know how I made it through LPN school, or how I passed the boards. I made 1 very close friend that I am still in touch with. We got each other through. After I graduated, I jumped around to a few different places. Iowa is a funny (not ha ha) place. They are not used to New Yorkers. Or our accents. Or, maybe I should say the way we speak. I am a very ""to the point"" person. You never have to worry where you stand with me. I will always tell you the truth, because...lets be honest, no one likes being deceived. I also try to word things in such a way to put people at ease. Oh, and I am always the 1st person to go introduce myself to the new person in a room and put them at ease. Just so you understand the type of person I am. I love to make people laugh. I love to tell stories. However, when it comes to work.....I will always respect your privacy, never break HIPAA, and I will be honest with you (within the scope of my practice) and I will make it my business to find answers to any question I don't have the answer to. If I say I will call you, I WILL call you. I have been known to call patients at 5:30pm about their INR results, when I should have been gone at 4pm. So....OK. I worked in a few clinics, worked in a few nursing homes. Some managers made me feel that because of my ""roots"" and the way I sounded, I was yelling at co-workers. (really?) telling them what to do. She said there were numerous complaints from them. I was devastated. I resigned. At a nursing home, they didn't train me. I hadn't worked in that arena before, and they threw me to the wolves. I was there 3 months. They just set me up to fail. I came home crying every day. Meanwhile. I lost a patient there that I adored. She had pneumonia. They didn't send her to the ER quick enough. I was not there that day. Don't get me started on that!! So, here I am. 5 months unemployed. Looking for a job. 4+ years only as an LPN, and not only am I disheartened, but I am disillusioned and already exhausted and questioning myself. Thinking-did I do the right thing by becoming a nurse? But I love helping people, regardless. So, I have been trying to look for things I could do online-from home. I figured, I could still do something medical...still help people. Then I saw your ad. I read it. And I thought. I could do that. I could not only do that I could be great at that!! I am already a nurse!! I already know a lot of stuff!!! Then I started to get exited! But then I said to myself.. No its gonna cost money, and we don't have it right now. But then I started thinking again, If I could do this, I could have my own business, work from home, help my own patients and make really good money!!! And the positive kept outweighing the negative. Well, then I started talking to you. And the rest, as they say... is history. I am nervous. I am scared. But I am more excited for the future I can have."
In 2015, my mother suffered from two strokes and three cardiac arrests. And I was. Or Anne was her only daughter. So I was her caregiver. Until she passed away in January of 2025, this year. Since then, I've been working to lose weight. I've had high blood pressure for a while. And I've lost 30 pounds. But when I went to the doctor, I was expecting for a good health report in October. But unfortunately, besides having high blood pressure, they said I have stage three chronic kidney disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and an enlarged thyroid. I started doing research for natural things to bring down my diabetes, to improve my cholesterol, and I came across your page. I'm also very active with using AI. I entered my information into AI.arding my health and my desire to also lose weight. And I was able to receive some information, but. When I saw your page, I thought this would really be useful because I don't always believe that. Eastern. Cuse me, Western medicine is the only method. I think that there should be a combination of Eastern and Western. And I don't think that doctors give us all of the information because pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical companies. They play a big part. In not necessarily making us better, but placating health issues because there's big money in pharma. So that's what drew me to your course was some of the things you had to say. So I'm looking at it initially for myself and then if I see that the benefits and changes within me, I could certainly see. Helping others. And I would really like that.
I personally have experienced the medical field, both professionally and personally. I want to help others feel better, and learn how to do that! This is the place to be!
I am a nurse manager working in a specialized field. the company I work for is a huge corporation.  I believe it is a good company, but it IS a corporation, doing what corporations do to survive. What this has trickled down to at my level is a lot of busy work to prove we are doing our job, track everything, and fuel spreadsheets and pie charts for corporate actions plans and strategy meetings that have everything to do with the bottom line and very little to do with what actually improves patient care. We are short staffed and I have been working double duty for nearly 4 years now. I am exhausted, burned out and worried about how broken our health care system is. I need a change. I love helping people and feeling like I am making a difference in people's lives.    I have been interested in Functional Health for several years now and recently really focused on implementing some functional health strategies to improve my own health, improve my focus and help me continue to deal with the heavy pressures of my job and life.  Functional Health coaching seems like an ideal fit for me but, to be honest, I am not sure I can do it. I signed up for the course primarily to further my knowledge for my own health and benefit. Maybe it will lead to more. we will see.
I’m looking at investing in a functional medicine practice and I want to ensure that I am confident in capable
Just looking to increase my knowledge of functional medicine!

"I generally prefer to be a real life person and make use of the internet primarily to find opportunities to travel through time and space for new experiences. For the past several
years I have begun documenting parts of my life on FB daily. Moods thoughts artistic sharings and processes with my son. For therapeutic work I have found driving for Lyft seemed to be my calling, until I started experiencing too much postural pain from repetitive motions. Although it has become more of our regular daily pattern, unforeseen circumstances have also really gotten me to begin opening to new forms of work and work from home. We love to travel, including internationally, so a new international medicine certificate providing current tools and skills to assist others and their lives sounds simple enough along homeschooling my own son."
I have had chronic Lyme since I was 7. It almost took my life in 2022. I was septic and had meningitis and renal failure. I took it upon myself to leave the hospital and travel for stem cells. I have researched and studied all about integrative care parasites and all the illnesses we are lied to about. I have the rife machine and have had to treat myself because there is no care where I live. I want to help others that is my mission
I'm a holistic therapist looking to add to my therapies to enable me to help my clients more. I would love to be able to travel more and earn and hold retreats
People come to me daily as I'm their default when the official practitioner is unavailable. I've learned a lot from him.
I already work in the health and wellness industry with vitamin supplementation, peptides, etc I want to further my knowledge
I’ve always been passionate about helping others. I spent 20 years working as a mental health therapist with teens. I transitioned from that to being an entrepreneur with a tea and apothecary company focused on health and wellness to help people heal from the inside out. I found myself doing alot of wellness coaching and creating specialized teas and products to help my customers heal specific things. The solutions worked, but only addressed the immediate symptoms not the root causes of their pain. I want to learn more to help people experience complete wholeness. I never knew about functional medicine, but when I started researching it recently it sounded like the perfect next pivot to me, to help my customers and others more effectively.
I am seeking unconventional ways to assist others while generating income for myself in retirement. I have worked as a nurse for the past 49 years.
I want to learn the fundamentals of integrative medicine and functional health.
I turned 58, have multiple started and failed attempts at being a functional coach. I need to do this NOW. My husband just left, I have no money, I love helping people and my daughter, 25 yrs, is struggling with an autoimmune disease that Dr's. are having a hard time diagnosing. I know I can figure this out and help her once I have the tools and support from your program. I am wanting to create a large practice, both online and personal.
I already work with clients
53yo, divorced decades ago , single, empty nester. Peds  RN for past 10yrs. Looking for a way to combine nursing knowledge with compassion, helping people feel heard utilizing a whole person approach to supporting health and wellness on all parts of the wellness continuum. Looking for flexibility for my own health & wellness and more time with my most important treasure : my family. Apparently my “hobby” is working MORE for fun ! 😂 Many other personal experiences will come up in coaching sessions I’m sure , but  that’s my “elevator speech” 😂😂😂😂
Alternative treatments
I read your response email. It made so much sense to me. You are right I am a survivor and my story is really just beginning not really ending. I’ve looked at a few different health coaching programs but I like that this one is functional medicine coaching and the topics. You email said maybe I found you because I’m already losing those things and now I’m channeling them with all of my knowledge. You also said the other package the you tube one wasn’t a waste because I would be using it to share information down the road and I don’t plan on buying the level 2&3 but every topic os all of the same stuff I’m already doing my own research on and interested in. Hornones, NAD+, supplements..etc. I want to teach, inspire, and engage with a community that discusses and promotes health wellness and functional medicine. We re all in this together.
I became a Registered Nurse at age 19...literally still a teenager. I have now practiced as a Nurse Practitioner for 14 years. I am 40 years old now, been married almost 17 years and I just had our 7th beautiful child. I used to be on the western medicine band wagon 100% but many years ago a friend of mine shared her tragic story of her son's vaccine injury. That experience is what started my questioning of so many things and began my journey of learning more about natural/functional medicine. As the years have passed, I have felt more and more out of place and unhappy  in the hospital setting in which I work. My heart and the Spirit are drawing me toward something bigger, better and more meaningful. I need to learn more and find a way to implement these crucial changes in my own life, the lives of my husband and kids, and by the grace of God, the lives of my future patients/clients. I am also tired of being tied to a hospital, working nights, weekends and holidays. I want the freedom to choose a better schedule and work remotely at least part of the time to travel with my kiddos before it's too late. I want to feel like I am contributing to more complete healing for my patients. I want to be apart of the transformative journey of others and do something that matters. I am specifically interested in learning more and treating those with PCOS who are trying to become pregnant because that has been my infertility struggle, causing us to require fertility treatments to create our beautiful babies. I would also love to work with those that have been injured by vaccines. That's just a little about me and my dreams for my future. But I'm scared to think it could be a reality for me. I've worked in a hospital for the last 21 years and never thought to pursue anything different, let alone my own business. There is comfort in what I know, but I think I am ready to face the discomfort of change and growth to welcome something better for me and my family. I feel like this is the direction that my Heavenly Father is leading me.
I really like natural  approach in health, and want to help other people to become healthy as well.
I am a LVN and I am exhausted! I am about to be 50 and I think our healthcare system has run off the rails. I find many of my patients begging for natural, diet related answers that I know we could provide if we were able to spend more time.
I’m 64 years old and I’m just now beginning to realize how important hormone therapy is and the menopausal symptoms as I was not treated properly so now I wanna get educated
To improve my practice
Getting RN
I am already a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner who has completed CNHP training in the past. I want to update information in helping those with mental health issues.
Ive always been interested in helping people with questions, they felt uncomfortable speaking  with their doctors about, I owned a home care business for 5 years and was limited on the advise I could give to help those in need.  Some days it was all about food choices and lifestyle changes
"I want to healing people wrong me , I want to have skill that mean much ! I am a massage therapist I can only do so much I want to healing help others ;  ofcoz I would
Like to have right clients to have income as well as single mom ."
I would like to healing people around me and make living
I want more credibility in what I do already every day. I've been an advanced colon hydrotherapist for 19 years now, and I want something different so that I'm not a slave to a brick and mortar.
"I’ve worked in several specialties over the past 22 years, with oncology and hematology being my longest focus. About 2.5 years ago, I began pursuing better pain-management options for my cancer patients, which led me to osteopathic medicine (micro-credential from UNTHSC) and eventually regenerative medicine, where I’m certified in both infusion and injection therapies. I’ll be attending the regenerative medicine summit in January for updated protocols and training.
I’ve been wanting to open my own clinic, but felt I needed broader experience in functional and integrative medicine to ensure a well-rounded approach. Your ad immediately caught my attention because it aligns perfectly with the type of practice I’ve been seeking. I appreciate your emphasis on the difference between “normal” and “optimal” — that deeper level of interpretation is exactly what I want to strengthen. My goal is always to identify root causes, not simply follow what insurance will cover, especially when healthier evidence-based options exist."
I would like to broaden my knowledge and use it for myself, family, and friends. I had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue 30 years ago and was healed by alternative medicine. My daughter suffers from chronic constipation. I would like to grow in this field of healing.
"I'll start by saying I've done bodywork (massage therapy) for 35 years, Colon hydrotherapy and in the middle somewhere I was a Realestate broker. I'm a mom of four: daughter 28 yrs, son 22 yrs, a bonus daughter 22yrs and bonus son 13 yrs. I also have 2 grandkids 9 and 5.
I've been married twice, divorced once.
 During my first marriage I had 39 surgeries, coded on the table twice, contracted Lyme from a tick in my side. The first episode took my brain for almost 8 months I didn't speak/move, second landed me in a wheelchair for a year. I've also been diagnosed with Hashimoto's, Fibromyalgia, Narcolepsy, Diabetes and EpsteinBarr. 
I've now been remarried for 2 years together 8 years. In this time I've had additional surgeries putting the total at 43...I managed to turn to holistic medicine and got off all narcotics and other meds replacing them with supplements and tincture's. I then became a Colon Hydrotherapist.
I had a very successful practice up until a year ago when we relocated from Nevada to Hawaii for my husband's job. A month after arriving I was told I had a rare cancer (a large mass on my hip) that needed to be removed. I didn't have medical here so I went back to Nv and stayed with a friend Sept.thru March.  I had two surgeries (a scar that's 8 inches on my left hip/low back. I did not have cancer....I had a very rare condition called Corneybacterium Bovis-a rare cow disease.
I am still doing some rehab from the hips down...During this I started having stomach issues and am seeing a GI specialist. I went to my homeopathic doctor in Nv and I have Hpylori and Candida....
I came across this on FB mktplace and it got me excited bc it seems as if it puts me back together and will allow me to help people again without it physically setting me back but also teach me more about what's happening with my stomach."
Felt like a natural progression for my Coaching practice.
"I am almost 72 years old, and with the state of politics, who knows whether Social Security, Medicaid, or Medicare will be available much longer? I need to develop a new stream of income and be self-sufficient in personal medical care. 
My background includes Information Technology and  Private Pole Vault Coaching. I have always loved learning and was regularly chosen to lead new technology projects."
I've been a Nurse Practitioner for 14 years, and I have been frustrated with the current healthcare system, especially when it comes to promoting productivity over patient outcomes. I want to really help people.
"Retired information technology worker looking to learn something new, and help others in my situation. With Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare on the chopping block, I must develop a backup plan for new streams of income.

I have become very interested in Peptides in the last year and want to dovetail that interest with the need to become self-sufficient in my healthcare, prepared to assist others in the same boat. 

I am 72 years old and have always been chosen to lead new technology projects that made a difference in my profession. 

I spent 30 years as a private pole vaulting coach and enjoy coaching new individuals. I am excited to launch this new endeavor."
What brought me here is I've been looking for something I could do that was meaningful, that helped people, that would be in demand and provide me with a good income. Alopathic medicine leaves much to be desired. I am not anti-drugs but I always want to get to the root cause of some problem and handle that, not the symptoms. I've been studying health now for over 40 years and I've learned a lot. I'm 75 years old and in relatively good health for my age. I still work full time. I'm a cashier and sales associate at Home Depot. I enjoy working with the customers and helping them. I've done many different jobs in my life and most I've enjoyed. I'm a certified Life Coach but never got that off the ground. I didn't have someone like you to help be get it going. I'm a licensed Realtor and did that for 15 years and did well at it. I've also been a business consultant and did well at that. I'm interested in not just the health of the body but how the mind and spirit affect each other in contributing to illness or health. I have studied under Byron Katie at her School for the Work. I'm a spiritual person and know only love heals. Without love, things get sick and die. I feel I have a lot to offer others. By the way, I was in a cult for 38 years - Scientology. I learned a lot and it wasn't all bad. But I left when they tried to get me to disconnect from my son. My story is told in the documentary film, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. It was released in 2015 and garnered 3 Emmys. I've learned to question everything and look for truth. There's more but this is enough for now. Looking forward to learning from you and becoming a successful functional medicine coach with a thriving practice.
"I am beginning my Integrative and Functional Medicine certification today, and it feels like the right step because it aligns with everything I have believed and fought for over the past 20 years.

I have always been an advocate for a holistic approach to health — one that looks for the root causes behind the symptoms of chronic disease. This belief is what led me to create my How to Thrive After 55 project. Too often, Western doctors dismiss what patients are trying to say, offer little time for open-minded conversation, and send people home with a fistful of prescriptions. The system is flawed, and I have spent two decades pushing back against that mindset in my community and in my own family.

Losing my soulmate to cancer in 2021 only strengthened this conviction. I watched her go through the shock of the diagnosis and immediately receive a prescription for antidepressants, followed by surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation — with no true choice in the matter. The emotional and physical toll was enormous. That experience made me determined to become a change agent for people who are willing to question the “drug first” mindset and consider natural approaches that support the body’s own ability to heal. Not instead of medical care — but alongside it, with better questions, deeper understanding, and informed choice.

For years, my knowledge and research have been brushed aside because I don’t wear a white coat or hold a formal qualification framed on the wall. When universities are heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies, challenging the system becomes an uphill battle. This certification is my way of changing that dynamic.

It will validate what I have spent two decades learning, give me a recognised foundation for the work I already do, and send a clear message — especially to my family of nurses — that I truly do know what I am talking about."
I'm personally very interested in health and well-being. I'm also interested in topics like mindfulness, meditation, and emotional well-being, and I've written a few books on these subjects. I'd like to support people in feeling healthier, happier and more energized. I feel like simple lifestyle adjustments can make a big difference, and I'd like to share these tools with others.
