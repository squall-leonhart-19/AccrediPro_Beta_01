  "content": "Hi there! 💕\n\nCan I tell you a secret? On the day I got my first paying client, I was TERRIFIED. I thought I needed to have every answer memorized, every protocol perfected, every possible scenario prepared for.\n\nWant to know what actually happened?\n\nMy client asked me a question I didn't know the answer to. And you know what I said? \"That's a great question - let me research that and get back to you by tomorrow.\"\n\nShe didn't fire me. She didn't ask for a refund. She actually said, \"I love that you're honest and thorough!\"\n\nHere's the truth: Your clients don't need you to be a walking encyclopedia. They need you to:\n\n✅ Listen deeply to their struggles ✅ Care genuinely about their transformation ✅ Be honest when you don't know something ✅ Research and learn alongside them ✅ Show up consistently with your whole heart\n\nYou're not supposed to know everything on Day 1. You're supposed to be willing to learn, grow, and support your clients through their journey.\n\nThe certification gives you the foundation. Your heart and commitment give you everything else.\n\nWith belief in you, Sarah ✨\n\n💬 YOUR TURN: What's the ONE question you're most afraid a client will ask you? Drop it in the comments - let's normalize not knowing everything!\n\nAnd here's the magic: I bet someone in this community actually has the answer. That's the power of learning together. 👇"
