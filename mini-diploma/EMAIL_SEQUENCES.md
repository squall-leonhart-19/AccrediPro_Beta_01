# Mini Diploma Email Sequences

All email templates for the mini diploma nurturing funnel. Hormozi-style: value-first, proof stacking, pattern interrupts.

---

## PART 1: PRE-COMPLETION SEQUENCE

Goal: Get them to FINISH the Mini Diploma (9 lessons in 48 hours)

---

### EMAIL 1: Welcome (Immediately after signup)

**Subject:** Your first lesson is waiting (takes 5 min)

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

You just made a decision that could change everything.

I'm not being dramatic. I've watched 2,400+ women go from "just browsing" to building $5K-$10K/month practices. It all started with what you're about to learn.

**Your Mini Diploma access is now active.**

Here's what to do next:

1. [Click here to start Lesson 1]({{lessonLink}}) — takes 5 minutes
2. Complete all 9 lessons within 48 hours
3. Pass the final quiz
4. Get your ASI-Verified Certificate

Most people finish in a single sitting. It's designed that way.

One more thing — after you complete the Mini Diploma, I have something special for you. A scholarship that's only available to graduates.

But first: lesson 1.

[START LESSON 1 NOW →]({{lessonLink}})

Talk soon,

**Sarah Mitchell**
*Your Coach*

P.S. 89% of our students finish the same day they start. You've got this.

---

### EMAIL 2: Proof Story (+4 hours if not started)

**Subject:** Here's what Jennifer did after lesson 3

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

I noticed you haven't started yet. Totally fine — life happens.

But let me tell you about Jennifer.

She signed up at 9pm after putting the kids to bed. "Just going to peek at lesson 1," she said.

Three hours later, she was certified.

By week 2, she had her first client ($450).
By month 3, she was at $4,800/month.
By month 6, she quit her nursing job.

Her exact words: *"I almost closed the tab that first night. Thank God I didn't."*

You're one click away from your own Jennifer story.

[START YOUR MINI DIPLOMA →]({{lessonLink}})

The lessons aren't going anywhere for the next 44 hours. But that feeling of "I'll do it later"? That's the same voice that kept Jennifer stuck for years.

Don't let it win.

— Sarah

P.S. Lesson 1 is literally 5 minutes. That's it.

---

### EMAIL 3: Teach Something (+12 hours)

**Subject:** The one thing most people miss in lesson 5

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Quick heads up about lesson 5.

Most people rush through it because it seems simple. But there's a concept buried in there that changed how I think about everything:

**Root cause vs. symptom.**

Here's the thing — conventional health advice treats symptoms. Take this pill. Avoid that food. Do this exercise.

But functional medicine asks: *"Why is this happening in the first place?"*

When you understand that — REALLY understand it — you'll never look at health the same way. And neither will your future clients.

That's the moment most people go from "interesting course" to "wait, I could actually DO this."

You're {{lessonsRemaining}} lessons away from that moment.

[CONTINUE YOUR TRAINING →]({{lessonLink}})

— Sarah

P.S. You have {{hoursRemaining}} hours left on your access. Plenty of time if you start now.

---

### EMAIL 4: Voice Note Pattern Interrupt (+24 hours)

**Subject:** [Voice Note] Hey {{firstName}}, quick message...

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I recorded this for you. Takes 47 seconds.

[🎙️ PLAY VOICE NOTE]({{voiceNoteLink}})

*(Transcript below if you can't listen)*

— Sarah

---

**Voice Note Transcript:**

*"Hey {{firstName}}, it's Sarah. I noticed you started the Mini Diploma but haven't finished yet, and I just wanted to check in.*

*Look, I know life gets busy. I get it. But I also know that sometimes we get in our own way. We tell ourselves we'll do it later, and later becomes never.*

*You signed up for a reason. Something made you click that button. Don't let that moment pass.*

*You've got about 24 hours left. The lessons take maybe an hour total. And what's waiting on the other side... I really think it could change things for you.*

*Okay, that's it. Go finish. I'm rooting for you."*

---

### EMAIL 5: Proof Screenshot (+36 hours)

**Subject:** 3 clients in 2 weeks — her strategy

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I wasn't going to share this, but Michelle said it's okay.

[See screenshot of Michelle's client messages]

That's her phone. Three clients in two weeks, all from ONE Instagram post.

Her "strategy"? She posted:

*"Just got certified in functional medicine. Taking 3 clients this month. DM me if you've been struggling with [gut issues/fatigue/hormones] and want to actually fix it."*

That's it. No fancy funnel. No website. Just: I'm certified + I can help.

The certification gave her the confidence to post.
The post gave her clients.
The clients gave her $2,100 in her first month.

You're 12 hours away from having that same certification.

[FINISH YOUR MINI DIPLOMA →]({{lessonLink}})

12 hours, {{firstName}}. That's what's between you and your version of this story.

— Sarah

---

### EMAIL 6: Real Deadline (+44 hours)

**Subject:** I'm closing your access tonight

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

This isn't a marketing trick.

Your Mini Diploma access expires in 4 hours.

After that, the lessons lock. The quiz disappears. And the scholarship I mentioned? You won't qualify.

I set it up this way on purpose. Not to pressure you — but because I've learned that "someday" usually means "never."

You have two choices:

**Option A:** Close this email. Tell yourself you'll find another free training someday. Go back to whatever you were doing before.

**Option B:** Take 45 minutes right now. Finish the 9 lessons. Get your certificate. See what's on the other side.

I can't make this choice for you. But I can tell you that 2,400+ women chose Option B. And their lives look different now.

[FINISH BEFORE MIDNIGHT →]({{lessonLink}})

4 hours, {{firstName}}.

— Sarah

P.S. If something came up and you genuinely need more time, reply to this email. I'll see what I can do. But I need to hear from you before the deadline.

---

## PART 2: POST-COMPLETION SEQUENCE

Goal: Convert Mini Diploma graduates to Board Certification ($997)

---

### EMAIL 1: Congrats + Certificate (Immediately after exam pass)

**Subject:** 🎓 You're officially certified, {{firstName}}

**Body:**

{{firstName}}!!!

YOU DID IT.

You just joined 2,400+ certified functional medicine graduates. This is real.

**[DOWNLOAD YOUR CERTIFICATE →]({{certificateLink}})**

Add it to LinkedIn. Frame it. Send it to your mom. Whatever you do — celebrate this.

Now... about that scholarship I mentioned.

Because you completed the Mini Diploma, you qualify for something most people never see: my Board Certification Scholarship.

It's how our graduates go from "foundation knowledge" to "$5K-$10K/month practice."

I'll send you the details in a few hours. But for now — just sit with this moment.

You're certified.

Proud of you,

**Sarah**

---

### EMAIL 2: Value Calculator (+6 hours)

**Subject:** The math behind $8K/month (spreadsheet attached)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I made you something.

**[DOWNLOAD: Income Calculator Spreadsheet]({{calculatorLink}})**

It's the exact spreadsheet I use with my Board Certified graduates. Plug in your numbers and see what's possible.

Here's how the math works:

- Average session rate: $150-200
- Average package: $800-1,500 (3-5 sessions)
- Clients needed for $5K/month: 4-6
- Hours worked: 15-20/week

That's it. 5 clients paying $1,000 each = $5K/month. Part-time hours.

**But here's what the spreadsheet won't tell you:**

Clients pay *Board Certified* practitioners more.
They trust them faster.
They refer them to friends.

The Mini Diploma gave you knowledge. The Board Certification gives you CREDIBILITY.

Tomorrow, I'll show you what's included in the scholarship. For now, play with the spreadsheet.

— Sarah

P.S. One of our graduates hit $11K in month 4. She started exactly where you are right now.

---

### EMAIL 3: Proof Screenshot (+18 hours)

**Subject:** [Screenshot] This is Michelle's client roster

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I asked Michelle if I could share this. She said yes.

[SCREENSHOT: Michelle's calendar showing 12 booked client sessions]

That's her client calendar from last month. 12 sessions. $2,400.

She started exactly where you are — Mini Diploma graduate, nervous about taking the next step.

Here's what she told me last week:

*"The Board Certification paid for itself in my first two clients. And Sarah mentored me until I felt ready. I probably would've given up without that."*

The scholarship I'm offering you includes:
- Full Board Certification (12 modules)
- 1-on-1 mentorship with me until you're certified
- Done-for-you website
- Client acquisition kit

Tomorrow I'll show you the website we build for you. It's actually pretty cool.

— Sarah

---

### EMAIL 4: DFY Website Video (+30 hours)

**Subject:** The done-for-you website we build for you (video tour)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

This is what your website could look like in 7 days:

**[WATCH: Website Video Tour (2 min)]({{videoLink}})**

When you join Board Certification, our team builds this for you. You just:
1. Send us your photo
2. Write a short bio (we give you a template)
3. Tell us your niche

We handle the rest. Design, copy, booking system, payment integration.

Most practitioners spend months agonizing over their website. Ours takes 7 days.

Why does this matter?

Because the #1 reason people don't get clients isn't lack of skills — it's lack of a place to send people.

"Check out my website" is 100x more powerful than "I'm working on getting set up."

The scholarship includes this. Along with:
- Full Board Certification
- 1-on-1 mentorship until certified
- Client acquisition templates
- Legal contracts
- ASI Directory listing

Speaking of objections... I know you have them. Let's talk about that tomorrow.

— Sarah

---

### EMAIL 5: Objection Killer (+42 hours)

**Subject:** The 3 objections I hear (and why they're wrong)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Let me guess what's going through your head:

**"I'm not ready to take clients yet."**

Good. That's why I mentor you UNTIL you're certified and confident. Not 4 calls. Not a group session. One-on-one with me until you're ready. That's the deal.

**"I can't afford $997 right now."**

I get it. That's why there's a 3-payment option: $397/month. The average first client pays $800-1,500. One client covers the entire investment.

**"What if I fail the Board exam?"**

You can retake it unlimited times. And I'll personally work with you until you pass. I've never had someone NOT pass who actually did the work.

Every objection you have, I've heard before. And I've solved for it.

Still have one I didn't mention? Reply to this email. I'll answer personally.

Or, if you're ready:

**[CLAIM YOUR SCHOLARSHIP →]({{scholarshipLink}})**

— Sarah

P.S. The scholarship expires in 30 hours. After that, the price goes up to $1,997. This isn't a marketing trick — I only offer this to fresh graduates while their momentum is high.

---

### EMAIL 6: Voice Note Check-in (+54 hours)

**Subject:** [Voice Note] Be honest — what's holding you back?

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Real talk:

**[🎙️ PLAY VOICE NOTE]({{voiceNoteLink}})**

— Sarah

---

**Voice Note Transcript:**

*"Hey {{firstName}}, it's Sarah.*

*I'm just going to be straight with you. You completed the Mini Diploma. You passed the exam. I know you're interested in the Board Certification — you've opened every email I've sent.*

*So what's the holdup? I'm genuinely asking.*

*Is it the money? Because we have payment plans. Is it time? Because it's self-paced. Is it fear of failing? Because I literally mentor you until you pass.*

*I'm not trying to pressure you. I just hate seeing people stay stuck when the thing they need is right in front of them.*

*If something's holding you back that I can help with, just reply. Tell me. Let's figure it out.*

*You've already proven you can do hard things. Don't stop now.*

*Okay. That's it. Talk soon."*

---

### EMAIL 7: Future Pacing (+66 hours)

**Subject:** If not now, then when?

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Close your eyes for a second (not really, you're reading).

Picture yourself 6 months from now:

**Scenario A:** You didn't take the scholarship. Life went back to normal. That "someday I'll build a coaching practice" feeling is still there. You're still in the same job, same schedule, same income.

**Scenario B:** You took the leap. You're Board Certified. You have a professional website. You've worked with 10, 15, maybe 20 clients. You're making $3K, $5K, maybe $8K per month on the side. Your spouse is proud. Your friends are asking how you did it.

The difference between Scenario A and Scenario B isn't talent.
It's not luck.
It's not having more time.

It's a decision. This decision. Right now.

**[CHOOSE SCENARIO B →]({{scholarshipLink}})**

The scholarship closes tomorrow. This is my second-to-last email about it.

— Sarah

---

### EMAIL 8: Payment Plan + Last Chance (+78 hours)

**Subject:** $397/month payment plan (final hours)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I've sent you a lot of emails. This is the last one about the scholarship.

Quick recap of what you get:
- ✅ Full Board Certification (12 modules) — $2,997 value
- ✅ 1-on-1 mentorship with me until certified — UNLIMITED
- ✅ Done-for-you website — $997 value
- ✅ Client acquisition kit — $697 value
- ✅ 30-day content calendar — $297 value
- ✅ Legal contract templates — $197 value
- ✅ ASI Directory listing — $197 value

**Total value: $8,576**

**Your scholarship price:** $997 (or 3x $397)

**Scholarship expires:** Tonight at midnight

After that, the investment goes to $1,997. I'm not going to extend it or "find" another discount. This is it.

If you're in, I'll see you on the other side:

**[FULL PAYMENT: $997 →]({{checkoutFullLink}})**

**[PAYMENT PLAN: 3x $397 →]({{checkoutPlanLink}})**

If you're not ready, that's okay too. I'll still be here if you change your mind later (at the higher price).

Either way — thank you for completing the Mini Diploma. You earned that certificate.

With respect,

**Sarah Mitchell**

P.S. 100% money-back guarantee. If you don't love it in 30 days, I'll refund every penny. No questions. You have nothing to lose.

## PART 5: VOICE NOTE SCRIPTS

### Voice Note 1: 24-Hour Check-in (Pre-Completion)

*Duration: 47 seconds*

```
"Hey {{firstName}}, it's Sarah. I noticed you started the Mini Diploma but haven't finished yet, and I just wanted to check in.

Look, I know life gets busy. I get it. But I also know that sometimes we get in our own way. We tell ourselves we'll do it later, and later becomes never.

You signed up for a reason. Something made you click that button. Don't let that moment pass.

You've got about 24 hours left. The lessons take maybe an hour total. And what's waiting on the other side... I really think it could change things for you.

Okay, that's it. Go finish. I'm rooting for you."
```

---

### Voice Note 2: "What's Holding You Back" (Post-Completion)

*Duration: 52 seconds*

```
"Hey {{firstName}}, it's Sarah.

I'm just going to be straight with you. You completed the Mini Diploma. You passed the exam. I know you're interested in the Board Certification — you've opened every email I've sent.

So what's the holdup? I'm genuinely asking.

Is it the money? Because we have payment plans. Is it time? Because it's self-paced. Is it fear of failing? Because I literally mentor you until you pass.

I'm not trying to pressure you. I just hate seeing people stay stuck when the thing they need is right in front of them.

If something's holding you back that I can help with, just reply. Tell me. Let's figure it out.

You've already proven you can do hard things. Don't stop now.

Okay. That's it. Talk soon."
```

---

### Voice Note 3: DM Check-in (Post-Completion)

*Duration: 28 seconds*

```
"Hey {{firstName}}, quick question — is it the price, the time, or something else that's making you hesitate?

I'm not trying to sell you anything right now. I just want to understand. If there's something I can help with, let me know.

And if the answer is 'it's just not the right time,' that's totally okay too. No pressure.

Just let me know what's going on. Talk soon."
```

---

## PART 6: WINBACK SEQUENCE (Scholarship Expired, No Purchase)

Goal: Recover leads who didn't buy during the 72-hour scholarship window

---

### WINBACK 1: No Hard Feelings (+24 hours after scholarship expires)

**Subject:** No pressure — but I wanted you to know this

**Body:**

Hey {{firstName}},

The scholarship window closed. No drama.

I'm not going to pretend there's "one more spot" or some last-minute extension. That's not how I operate.

But I do want you to know: the door isn't closed forever.

If you ever decide you're ready for Board Certification, the standard price is $1,997. Not as good as the scholarship, but still a fraction of what other programs charge.

I'm not going anywhere. And neither is that certificate you earned.

When you're ready — if you ever are — I'll be here.

— Sarah

P.S. In the meantime, I'll still send you occasional tips and success stories. You're part of this community now. 💛

---

### WINBACK 2: Success Story (+7 days)

**Subject:** She almost didn't join either...

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Quick story.

Patricia was a Mini Diploma graduate just like you. She loved the training. She wanted the Board Certification.

But she didn't buy during the scholarship window.

"I just couldn't justify $997 right then," she told me later.

Three months passed. She stayed on my email list. Kept seeing the success stories. Kept thinking about it.

Then one day she replied to an email like this one: *"Okay, I'm ready. What do I do?"*

She paid full price ($1,997). She got certified in 10 weeks. She hit $4,200/month by month 4.

Her only regret? *"I wish I'd just figured out the $997 back then. I'd be 3 months ahead."*

I'm not saying this to guilt you. I'm saying it because I've seen this pattern dozens of times.

The people who eventually come back almost always wish they'd started sooner.

When you're ready: [Board Certification Details →]({{boardCertLink}})

— Sarah

---

### WINBACK 3: New Offer / Event (+14 days)

**Subject:** Free masterclass this week (for Mini Diploma grads only)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I'm doing something I don't normally do.

This Thursday at 7pm EST, I'm hosting a live masterclass:

**"How to Get Your First 3 Paying Clients in 30 Days"**

It's only for Mini Diploma graduates. And it's free.

Here's what I'll cover:
- The exact Instagram post that gets coaching inquiries
- How to price your first packages (without undercharging)
- The DM script that converts interest into $800+ bookings
- Live Q&A — ask me anything

No pitch at the end. Just value.

**[SAVE MY SPOT →]({{masterclassLink}})**

See you Thursday?

— Sarah

P.S. If you can't make it live, register anyway. I'll send the replay.

---

### WINBACK 4: Quarterly Check-in (+90 days)

**Subject:** 3 months later — how's it going?

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

It's been about 3 months since you completed your Mini Diploma.

Just checking in: how's the functional medicine journey going?

Have you:
- Started talking to potential clients?
- Thought more about building a practice?
- Put it on the back burner (no judgment)?

I ask because I see three patterns with Mini Diploma graduates:

**Pattern 1:** They take the next step within days. They're now earning $3K-$8K/month.

**Pattern 2:** They wait a few months, eventually come back, and wish they'd started sooner.

**Pattern 3:** They never come back. Life gets busy. The dream stays a dream.

I'm not trying to push you toward any pattern. I just want you to be honest with yourself about which one you're in.

If you're ready to move to Pattern 1, the Board Certification is still here: [Learn More →]({{boardCertLink}})

If you're not ready, that's okay. I'll keep sending you value.

Either way — I'm rooting for you.

— Sarah

---

## PART 7: DOWNSELL SEQUENCE (For Price-Sensitive Leads)

Goal: Capture leads who want to join but can't afford $997

---

### DOWNSELL 1: Payment Plan Push (+84 hours, still no purchase)

**Subject:** What if $397/month worked better?

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I've been thinking about our conversation (well, our email conversation).

You completed the Mini Diploma. You clearly want this. But something's holding you back.

If it's the $997 upfront, I totally get it. That's real money.

Here's the thing: the 3-payment plan ($397/month) is specifically designed for situations like this.

- First payment: $397 today
- Second payment: $397 in 30 days
- Third payment: $397 in 60 days

By the time you make your second payment, you could already have your first client ($800-$1,500).

The investment literally pays for itself.

**[START WITH $397 TODAY →]({{paymentPlanLink}})**

Same full program. Same mentorship. Same website. Just easier on the wallet.

— Sarah

P.S. This isn't a new offer. It's been there all along. I'm just highlighting it because I think it might be the answer.

---

### DOWNSELL 2: Core Program Only — $497 (+96 hours)

**Subject:** A smaller option (if $997 is too much right now)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I don't normally do this. But I want to help you get started.

If the full Board Certification ($997) feels like too much right now, there's a smaller option:

**Board Certification — Core Program: $497**

What you get:
- ✅ Full 12-module curriculum
- ✅ Board Certification exam + certificate
- ✅ ASI Directory listing
- ✅ Private community access

What you DON'T get:
- ❌ 1-on-1 mentorship with me
- ❌ Done-for-you website
- ❌ Client acquisition kit
- ❌ Bonuses

It's the education without the done-for-you support. Perfect if you're more of a self-starter.

**[GET CORE PROGRAM — $497 →]({{coreOnlyLink}})**

Or, if you want the full experience with everything included, the payment plan is still available:

**[FULL PROGRAM — 3x $397 →]({{paymentPlanLink}})**

Either way, I just want you to start.

— Sarah

---

### DOWNSELL 3: Audit Only — $297 (+7 days, no purchase)

**Subject:** Quick question about your practice

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I have a question:

Would a 1-hour strategy session with me be helpful right now?

I'm offering a limited number of spots for mini audit calls:

**90-Minute Practice Audit — $297**

What we cover:
- Your current situation and goals
- Your ideal niche (and how to find clients)
- A custom 90-day roadmap to your first $3K month
- My honest assessment of what you need

This isn't a pitch call. It's a working session. You leave with a plan.

If you're not ready for the full Board Certification, this might be the perfect next step.

**[BOOK YOUR AUDIT — $297 →]({{auditLink}})**

Only 5 spots available this month.

— Sarah

P.S. If you book an audit and later decide to join Board Certification, I'll apply the $297 toward your investment.

---

## PART 8: LONG-TERM NURTURE (30/45/60/90 Days)

Goal: Stay top of mind with Mini Diploma graduates who didn't purchase. Provide value. Build relationship. Convert later.

---

### LT-NURTURE 1: Day 7 — Value Email (Teaching)

**Subject:** The #1 mistake new coaches make (and how to avoid it)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Quick insight from my 20+ years in this space.

The #1 mistake new coaches make isn't about skills. It's about positioning.

They try to help everyone.
- "I can help with gut health, hormones, stress, weight, energy, sleep..."

That's not a niche. That's a menu.

Clients don't hire generalists. They hire specialists.

The coach who says "I help burnt-out nurses finally lose the 30 lbs that won't budge" gets 10x more clients than "I'm a health coach who can help with weight."

Specificity = credibility.

If you're thinking about building a practice, start here: pick ONE problem. Solve it for ONE type of person.

That's lesson #1 from the trenches.

— Sarah

P.S. Want help finding your niche? Reply to this email. I read every response.

---

### LT-NURTURE 2: Day 14 — Success Story

**Subject:** How Melissa got 4 clients in her first month

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Melissa's story is worth sharing.

She completed the Mini Diploma in October. Didn't join Board Certification right away (sound familiar?).

But she did something smart: she started talking.

Not selling. Just talking.

She told her sister about what she learned. Her sister told a friend. That friend asked: "Wait, can you help me with this?"

Melissa's first client came from a conversation at Thanksgiving dinner. $600.

By December, she had 4 clients. $2,400/month.

She eventually joined Board Certification in January — paid for by her clients.

The lesson? You don't need the "official" Board Certification to start conversations. Your Mini Diploma is a real credential.

Start talking. See what happens.

### LT-NURTURE 3: Day 21 — Behind the Scenes

**Subject:** A peek inside my actual coaching practice

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I don't normally share this, but here's what a week in my practice looks like:

**Monday:** 3 client sessions (virtual, 60 min each)
**Tuesday:** Content creation + community support
**Wednesday:** 4 client sessions
**Thursday:** Mentorship calls with Board Certified graduates
**Friday:** Off (usually hiking or with my daughter)

Total client hours: ~7 per week
Total income: Let's just say it's more than I made in any clinical job 👀

The beauty of this business: you set the schedule. You pick the clients. You control the income.

That's what I want for you, too.

— Sarah

P.S. If you ever want to chat about what this could look like for you, just reply. I'm happy to talk.

### LT-NURTURE 4: Day 30 — Direct Check-in

**Subject:** Month 1 check-in: where are you at?

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

It's been about a month since you completed the Mini Diploma.

Honest question: what's your current status?

**Option A:** "I've been thinking about it but haven't taken action yet"

**Option B:** "I've started talking to people and have some interest"

**Option C:** "I'm stuck and don't know what to do next"

**Option D:** "I've moved on to other things"

Just reply with A, B, C, or D. I read every response.

If you're at B or C, I might have some specific advice. If you're at D, no hard feelings — I'll remove you from these emails so I don't clutter your inbox.

Either way, I appreciate you being real with me.

— Sarah

### LT-NURTURE 5: Day 45 — Resource Share

**Subject:** Free resource I should've sent you earlier

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I realized I never sent you this.

**[FREE DOWNLOAD: 30-Day Client Attraction Calendar]({{calendarLink}})**

It's the exact calendar I give to my Board Certified graduates. 30 days of specific actions to attract your first clients.

Day 1: Update your Instagram bio to include your specialty
Day 7: Post your "certification announcement"
Day 14: Share a transformation story (even if it's your own)
Day 21: Make your first "I'm accepting clients" post
Day 30: Follow up with everyone who engaged

Simple. Actionable. No fluff.

Even without Board Certification, you can start using this today.

### LT-NURTURE 6: Day 60 — Soft Pitch

**Subject:** 2 months later: still thinking about it?

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

Two months.

That's how long it's been since you completed the Mini Diploma.

Some people in that time:
- Stayed on the sidelines (no judgment)
- Started having conversations with potential clients
- Joined Board Certification and are now earning income

I don't know which bucket you're in. But if you're still thinking about Board Certification, I want to address the elephant in the room:

**The longer you wait, the harder it gets.**

Not because the program gets harder. But because life fills the gap. New priorities emerge. The motivation fades.

Jennifer waited 6 months. She told me: *"I wasted half a year being scared of something that wasn't even scary."*

If this is still on your heart, maybe stop thinking and start doing.

Or don't. But at least make a decision.

### LT-NURTURE 7: Day 90 — "Last Email" (Creates FOMO)

**Subject:** Removing you from the list (unless...)

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

I'm cleaning up my email list.

You completed the Mini Diploma 3 months ago. Since then, you've received:
- Success stories
- Free resources
- Tips and strategies
- Invitations to Board Certification

But you haven't taken the next step.

That's 100% okay. Maybe the timing isn't right. Maybe this path isn't for you.

Either way, I don't want to keep emailing someone who's moved on.

**So here's the deal:**

If you want to STAY on my list and keep receiving content, click here:
**[YES, KEEP ME ON THE LIST →]({{stayOnListLink}})**

If I don't hear from you in 7 days, I'll assume you've moved on and remove you.

No hard feelings either way. Seriously.

But if there's still a spark — if you're still curious about what Board Certification could do for you — now's the time to say so.

**[YES, I'M STILL INTERESTED →]({{interestedLink}})**

Talk soon (or not),

— Sarah

## PART 9: RE-ENGAGEMENT / REVIVAL EMAIL

For people who click "I'm still interested" in Day 90 email

---

### REVIVAL 1: Personalized Outreach

**Subject:** You're still interested — let's talk

**Body:**

{{firstName}},

You clicked "I'm still interested." That tells me something.

Here's what I want to do: let's figure out what's been holding you back.

Is it:
- **Money?** We have payment plans and a smaller Core-Only option.
- **Time?** It's self-paced. Most people finish in 8-12 weeks.
- **Fear?** I mentor you until you're confident. Literally.
- **Something else?** Tell me.

Reply to this email with ONE sentence about what's stopping you.

I'll personally respond with a solution — or tell you honestly if this isn't right for you.

Deal?

— Sarah

P.S. The people who reply are the ones who eventually succeed. Be one of those people.
