**Hi [First Name],**

I wanted to follow up after our call the other day.

I know making a decision about your health can feel big—and I want you to feel 100% confident in whatever you choose.

**I'm wondering:**

- Do you have any questions I can answer?
- Is there anything holding you back that we should talk about?
- Would it help to have a quick follow-up chat?

**I genuinely believe in what we discussed**, and more importantly, I believe in YOU and your ability to [achieve their goal].

If [Program Name] isn't the right fit right now, that's completely okay. I just want to make sure you have everything you need to make the best decision for yourself.

Either way, I'm here.

Just hit reply and let me know what's on your mind.

Warmly,

[Your Name]
