## Email 2: Mindset & Expectations
**Subject Lines:**
- Setting yourself up for success

- The mindset that changes everything

**Send:** Day 2

---

**Hi [First Name],**

Before we officially begin, I want to share something important.

**The clients who get the BEST results all have something in common:**

It's not that they're more disciplined. It's not that they have more time. It's not that they're "better" at this.

**It's their MINDSET.**

Here's what I want you to adopt as you begin this journey:

**1. Progress Over Perfection**
You don't need to be perfect. You need to be consistent. Aim for 80% compliance and give yourself grace.

**2. Curiosity Over Judgment**
When something doesn't go as planned, get curious instead of critical. Ask "What can I learn?" instead of "Why did I fail?"

**3. Trust the Process**
There may be weeks where you don't see immediate changes. Trust that the work is working, even when you can't see it yet.

**4. Communicate Openly**
If something isn't working, TELL ME. If you're struggling, TELL ME. I can only help you if I know what's going on.

**5. You Are the Expert on You**
I bring the knowledge and guidance. You bring the insight into your own body and life. Together, we create magic.

**Your homework before our first session:**

Write down your answers to these questions:
- What does success look like for you at the end of this program?
- What has held you back in the past?
- What are you most excited about?
- What are you most nervous about?

Bring these to our first session—we'll discuss!

Excited for you,

[Your Name]
