**Send:** Day 4

**Hi [First Name],**

I know you might be thinking...

**"What if it doesn't work for me?"**

I hear you. You've probably tried things before that didn't work.

Here's what's different: [Explain your unique approach/why it works]

**"I don't have time for this."**

I totally get it—life is busy. That's exactly why I designed [Program Name] to [fit into busy lives/be efficient/be flexible]. You'll spend [time commitment] per week, and every minute is focused on what actually moves the needle.

**"I can't afford it."**

Let me ask you this: What is it costing you NOT to solve this?

- The energy you're missing?
- The productivity you've lost?
- The money spent on things that don't work?
- The quality of life you're sacrificing?

[Program Name] is an investment in YOUR health and future. And I've made it accessible with [payment plan option if applicable].

**"I'm scared it won't work and I'll have wasted money."**

[If you have a guarantee:]
That's why I offer [guarantee details]. I want you to feel completely confident taking this step.

**"I should probably just try to figure it out on my own first."**

You could... but how's that been working so far? Sometimes the fastest path forward is getting expert help.

Still have questions? Hit reply—I'll answer personally.
