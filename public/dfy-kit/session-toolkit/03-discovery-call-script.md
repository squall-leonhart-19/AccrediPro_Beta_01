>
> "Can I ask - what would be different in a week or a month that would help you decide? [Gently explore if thinking = avoiding]"

**"It's too expensive"**

>
> "I offer [payment plan option] - would breaking it into payments help?"

> "I completely understand that frustration. Can I ask - has anything you've tried included [your unique approach]?"
