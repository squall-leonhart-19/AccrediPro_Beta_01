## WEEK 1: Introduction & Education

### Day 1 - INTRODUCTION
**Type:** Story/Personal
**Visual:** Professional photo of you

**Caption:**
Hey there! 👋 I'm [Your Name], and I'm a [Your Title].

I help [ideal client description] to [transformation you provide].

But here's the thing—I didn't always know this was my path...

### Day 2 - EDUCATIONAL
**Type:** Tip/Value
**Visual:** Carousel with 5 tips or single graphic

**Caption:**
5 signs your body is BEGGING for nutrition support 🆘

1️⃣ You're exhausted even after sleeping
2️⃣ You crave sugar constantly
3️⃣ Brain fog is your constant companion
4️⃣ You get sick more than you used to
5️⃣ Your digestion is unpredictable

Here's the truth: These aren't "normal" signs of aging or stress.

They're signals that something needs attention.

The good news? Small changes can make a BIG difference.

Which one resonates with you most? 👇

---

### Day 3 - MYTHBUSTING
**Type:** Educational
**Visual:** "MYTH vs TRUTH" graphic

**Caption:**
MYTH: You have to eat perfectly to be healthy 🤦‍♀️

TRUTH: Progress over perfection is what gets results.

I see so many people stuck in all-or-nothing thinking.

"I ate one cookie so the day is ruined."
"I can't start until Monday."
"I'm not disciplined enough for this."

Here's what I've learned: The people who get lasting results aren't perfect. They're CONSISTENT.

They aim for 80/20.
They get back up when they fall.
They stop making food the enemy.

Who needed to hear this today? 💛

---

### Day 6 - VALUE/EDUCATION
**Type:** How-To
**Visual:** Step-by-step carousel or infographic

**Caption:**
3 things to do BEFORE you eat (that change everything) 🍽️

Most people focus on WHAT to eat... but HOW you eat matters just as much.

Try this:

1️⃣ PAUSE - Take 3 deep breaths before eating
↳ Activates rest-and-digest mode

2️⃣ SIT - Eat at a table, not standing/driving
↳ Helps with mindful eating and digestion

3️⃣ CHEW - 20-30 chews per bite minimum
↳ Digestion starts in your mouth!

These simple habits can transform how you feel after meals.

Tag someone who needs this reminder! 💚

### Day 9 - PERSONAL STORY
**Type:** Vulnerability
**Visual:** Authentic photo of you

**Caption:**
I used to think I had to figure everything out on my own.

For years I struggled with [your struggle], trying every [diet/approach/supplement] I could find.

What finally changed?

I stopped DIY-ing my health and got SUPPORT.

A coach who saw what I couldn't see.
A plan tailored to MY body.
Accountability when I wanted to give up.

That experience is exactly why I do what I do now.

You don't have to figure this out alone. 💛

---

### Day 10 - QUICK TIP
**Type:** Actionable Tip
**Visual:** Simple graphic with tip

**Caption:**
Health hack you can do in 30 seconds ⏱️

Add 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar to water before meals.

### Day 12 - PROBLEM/SOLUTION
**Type:** Educational
**Visual:** Before/After concept graphic

**Caption:**
FEELING: Exhausted all day, wired at night?

This is your cortisol rhythm out of balance. 😵

Normal cortisol: HIGH in morning (energizing), LOW at night (sleepy)

Disrupted cortisol: Low in morning (can't wake up), High at night (can't sleep)

What causes this?
• Chronic stress
• Poor sleep habits
• Blood sugar swings
• Too much caffeine
• Over-exercising

What helps:
✓ Morning sunlight
✓ Stress management daily
✓ Blood sugar balance
✓ Evening wind-down routine
✓ Gentle exercise

Sound like you? You're not broken—your rhythm just needs resetting. 💪

---

### Day 13 - RELATABLE
**Type:** Meme/Humor
**Visual:** Relatable meme or funny graphic

**Caption:**
POV: Someone says "just drink more water" when you're dealing with chronic fatigue 🙃

(If only it were that simple, right?)

Don't get me wrong—hydration matters!

But if you're STILL exhausted after trying all the "simple fixes"... there's usually something deeper going on.

That's where functional approaches shine. We dig deeper.

Tag someone who relates 😂

### Day 14 - SOFT CTA

## WEEK 3: Overcoming Objections & Building Trust

### Day 15 - OBJECTION HANDLING
**Type:** Address Concern
**Visual:** Text-based graphic

**Caption:**
"I've tried everything and nothing works."

I hear this SO often. And I get it.

You've done the diets.
The supplements.
The detoxes.
Maybe even other programs.

So why didn't they work?

Usually, one of these:
1️⃣ It wasn't personalized to YOUR body
2️⃣ Root causes weren't addressed
3️⃣ You didn't have consistent support
4️⃣ Multiple things needed attention at once

Working with a coach is different because we look at the WHOLE picture and create a plan specific to YOU.

That's why my clients get results when "everything else" didn't work.

Curious? DM me and let's chat. 💛

---

### Day 16 - EDUCATIONAL
**Type:** Carousel
**Visual:** 5-slide educational carousel

**Caption:**
Signs of BLOOD SUGAR imbalance 📊

Your blood sugar affects EVERYTHING—energy, mood, cravings, sleep, hormones.

Signs yours might be off:

1️⃣ Energy crashes mid-afternoon
2️⃣ Hangry when you don't eat
3️⃣ Sugar cravings after meals
4️⃣ Waking at 3am
5️⃣ Difficulty losing weight

The fix isn't just "eat less sugar."

It's about:
✓ Protein at every meal
✓ Never eating carbs alone
✓ Eating in the right order
✓ Movement after meals
✓ Managing stress

Save this for later! 🔖 And share with someone who needs it.

### Day 18 - VALUE
**Type:** Recipe/Practical
**Visual:** Food photo or recipe graphic

**Caption:**
My go-to breakfast for STABLE energy all morning 🍳

✨ BALANCED BREAKFAST BOWL ✨

🥚 2 eggs (any style)
🥑 1/2 avocado
🥬 Handful of greens
🍠 Small portion roasted sweet potato
🫒 Drizzle of olive oil
🧂 Salt, pepper, herbs

Why it works:
✓ Protein (eggs) = satiety
✓ Healthy fat (avo + olive oil) = sustained energy
✓ Complex carbs (sweet potato) = fuel
✓ Fiber (greens) = blood sugar balance

No energy crash. No mid-morning cravings. Just focus and fuel.

Would you eat this? 🙋‍♀️
