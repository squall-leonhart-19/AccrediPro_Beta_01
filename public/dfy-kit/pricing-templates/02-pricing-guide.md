## PRICING PHILOSOPHY

### Key Principles

1. **Price based on VALUE, not time**
   - What is the transformation worth to your client?
   - What would they pay to solve their problem permanently?

2. **Know your numbers**
   - Calculate your desired annual income
   - Work backwards to determine pricing needs
   - Factor in taxes, business expenses, time off

3. **Start where you're comfortable, then raise**
   - Underpricing leads to resentment and burnout
   - You can always offer payment plans

4. **The confident price is the right price**
   - Your energy around pricing matters
   - If you can't say it confidently, you're not ready

- **Structure:** Fixed duration, specific outcomes, set price

### 4. Retainer/Ongoing Support
- **Pros:** Recurring revenue, long-term relationships
