Good morning! Quick audio for you today...

Your story - your health struggles, your transformation - THAT 
is what makes clients trust you.

You don't need a fancy degree. You need to have LIVED what 
they're going through.

Do today's action: Write down 3 health struggles you've overcome. 
Those become your "I understand you" stories.

Talk to you tomorrow!

Hey, it's Sarah! Big news today...

I'm opening 3 Career Accelerator scholarship spots for this group.

Normally it's $997, but for you - because you've been showing up 
consistently - it's just $297.

Here's what you get: Full certification, done-for-you materials, 
weekly calls with me, private community, and a year of support.

The math is simple: Get 2 clients at $150 each, and you've 
already made your investment back plus profit.

I'll share more details tomorrow. If you have questions, 
just reply to my message.

Talk soon!

## Day 14 - Deadline (45 sec)
**Filename:** `day-14-deadline.mp3`
**Tone:** Gentle urgency, respectful

```
Hey, it's Sarah. This is it - scholarship pricing ends tonight 
at midnight.

After this, Career Accelerator goes back to $997. 

I'm not going to email you 47 times begging. This is my last 
message about it.

If you're ready, the link is in today's lesson.
If not, I respect that. The doors will open again eventually.

Either way, I'm proud of you for showing up these 2 weeks.

If you need a payment plan, just ask. We'll make it work.

See you tomorrow.

## Day 21 - 3 Week Celebration (30 sec)
**Filename:** `day-21-celebration.mp3`
**Tone:** Celebratory, proud

```
THREE WEEKS! You did it!

Most people quit by Day 7. You're still here. That says everything 
about who you are and what you're capable of.

Take a moment today to celebrate yourself. Seriously. 

You've completed 21 days of showing up. That's more than most 
people do in a YEAR of "thinking about" starting a practice.

So proud of you. Keep going!
```

## Day 30 - The Gap Reveal (60 sec)
**Filename:** `day-30-gap.mp3`
**Tone:** Warm but serious, pivotal moment

```
Hey, it's Sarah. Today's lesson is important.

You've spent 30 days learning everything you need. You know how 
to find clients, how to price, how to run sessions, the legal 
stuff, the tech stuff...

You have EVERYTHING you need.

Except one thing: The credential.

Here's why it matters: Clients choose certified practitioners 
over uncertified ones. Insurance often requires certification. 
And certified practitioners charge 2 to 3 times more.

Without the credential, you have knowledge.
WITH the credential, you have a CAREER.

This is the gap. And tomorrow, I'll show you exactly how to close it.

Talk soon.
