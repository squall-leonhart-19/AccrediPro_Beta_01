Hey there! I'm Sarah, and I'm so glad you're here.

Before we dive in, I want to ask you something... 

What if I told you there's a way to earn five to fifteen thousand dollars a month... working fifteen to twenty hours a week... from your kitchen table... while your kids are at school?

No medical degree required. No fancy credentials. Just a passion for helping people... and the right training.

I know... that sounds crazy. I thought so too four years ago.

Back then? I was a forty-three year old single mom of two, barely holding it together. My husband had passed away eighteen months earlier. A heart attack at forty-six. No warning. Just... gone.

I fell apart. Grief, stress, anxiety. I gained thirty-five pounds. Couldn't sleep. Had panic attacks dropping my kids at school.

My doctor put me on antidepressants and sleeping pills. But I wasn't getting better. I was getting worse.

And I couldn't afford to fall apart... my kids needed me. I was all they had.

That's when I discovered functional medicine.

Within two months, I found my cortisol was through the roof. My gut was a mess. I had nutrient deficiencies. Things my doctor never checked.

Six months later? I was off the pills. Lost the weight. Sleeping again. I had my life back.

And I could finally be the mom my kids deserved.

Today? I work fifteen hours a week from home. I earn over six thousand dollars a month. I've helped over two hundred women transform their health.

And I'm there for every school pickup, every soccer game, every bedtime story.

That's what this training is about. Not just understanding health... but building a life. On your terms.

Now let me teach you the most important concept in functional medicine...

It's called root cause thinking.

Here's how most healthcare works: You have a headache? Take some Advil. Can't sleep? Here's a sleeping pill. Fatigue? "Try exercising more."

The symptom goes away... until it comes back. Or shows up somewhere else.

Root cause thinking is different.

Headache? Why? Is it dehydration? Gut issues? A hormone imbalance?

Can't sleep? Why? Is your cortisol dysregulated? Blood sugar crashing at night?

Fatigue? Why? Is it your thyroid? Nutrient deficiencies? Chronic inflammation?

When you fix the root cause... symptoms disappear permanently.

This is why root cause practitioners charge one-fifty to three hundred dollars per session... while average coaches struggle at fifty bucks.

And the best part? You don't need to be a doctor to do this. Doctors diagnose diseases and prescribe medications. They get seven minutes per patient.

You? You educate on nutrition and lifestyle. You support behavior change. You get sixty plus minutes with each client. You focus on wellness, not disease.

You're not replacing doctors. You're filling the gap they can't fill.

Clients don't want another pill. They want someone who listens. Someone who helps them understand their body. Someone who walks alongside them.

That's you.

In the next lesson, we're going to dive deep into the gut... because Hippocrates said "all disease begins in the gut" two thousand years ago.

And modern science? It's proving he was absolutely right.

I'll see you there.
