            "question": "During an indirect calorimetry assessment (L1), a client presents with a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.72. What does this metabolic data primarily indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily utilizing carbohydrates for fuel.",
                "The client is in a state of high metabolic flexibility.",
                "The client is primarily utilizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The client is experiencing significant protein oxidation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 shows the client is efficiently utilizing fatty acids, which is a key goal in metabolic efficiency training."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to the behavioral psychology principles discussed in L2, what is the median timeframe required for a new health behavior to reach 'automaticity' based on the Lally et al. (2009) study?",
            "options": [
                "21 days",
                "66 days",
                "90 days",
                "120 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the 21-day myth persists, peer-reviewed research by Lally et al. demonstrated that the median time for habit formation is 66 days, with a range of 18 to 254 days depending on complexity."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the Anti-Inflammatory Protocol (L3), which specific biomarker is used as the primary clinical indicator of systemic low-grade inflammation associated with 'Adiposopathy'?",
            "options": [
                "High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)",
                "Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)",
                "Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is the gold standard for measuring systemic inflammation. Levels above 3.0 mg/L are often associated with increased cardiovascular risk and adipose tissue dysfunction."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "The 'Energy Gap' theory in Lesson 4 suggests that for permanent weight maintenance, a client who has lost 10% of their body weight must manage a metabolic deficit of approximately how many calories compared to a person of the same weight who was never overweight?",
            "options": [
                "50-75 kcal/day",
                "170-250 kcal/day",
                "500-600 kcal/day",
                "800-1,000 kcal/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into the 'Energy Gap' shows that biological adaptations require successful maintainers to consume roughly 170-250 fewer calories (or burn them through activity) than their non-reduced counterparts to prevent weight regain."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Within the TRANSFORM Method™ (L5), the 'S' pillar refers to 'Strategic Macro-Cycling.' What is the primary physiological objective of this phase?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize muscle protein synthesis through high protein intake.",
                "To induce a state of permanent nutritional ketosis.",
                "To prevent down-regulation of thyroid hormones (T3) and leptin during caloric restriction.",
                "To eliminate all processed carbohydrates from the diet permanently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic Macro-Cycling (the 'S' in TRANSFORM) uses controlled periods of higher intake to signal hormonal safety to the hypothalamus, specifically protecting T3 and leptin levels to prevent metabolic adaptation."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "The MATADOR study (Minimizing Adaptive Thermogenesis And Deactivating Obesity Rebound) discussed in L6 demonstrated that which intervention resulted in significantly greater weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "Continuous energy restriction for 16 weeks.",
                "Intermittent energy restriction (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) for 30 weeks total.",
                "A very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) of 800 calories for 8 weeks.",
                "High-intensity interval training combined with ad libitum eating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MATADOR trial showed that 'diet breaks' (2 weeks on/2 weeks off) reduced the impact of adaptive thermogenesis, leading to greater total fat loss and better weight maintenance than continuous restriction."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Using the OARS framework in Advanced Coaching Communication (L7), which of the following is an example of an 'Affirmation' rather than a 'Compliment'?",
            "options": [
                "'You look great in those new clothes!'",
                "'I am so proud of you for losing five pounds.'",

                "'You are my most successful client this month.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Affirmations focus on the client's internal strengths and efforts (autonomy), whereas compliments are often evaluative and external. Highlighting 'persistence' reinforces the client's character and agency."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "According to the Professional Scope and Ethics (L8), which scenario requires an immediate referral to a licensed medical professional or registered dietitian?",
            "options": [
                "A client wanting to lose 20 pounds for a wedding.",
                "A client with a BMI of 28 who wants to start a walking program.",
                "A client presenting with unexplained rapid weight loss, extreme thirst, and frequent urination.",
                "A client who is confused about the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (unexplained weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria) are red flags for Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes and fall outside the coaching scope, requiring clinical diagnosis and management."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Metabolic Adaptation' (L6), what is the primary role of the hormone Leptin?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate hunger in the hypothalamus when the stomach is empty.",
                "To signal energy availability and satiety to the brain based on adipose stores.",
                "To regulate the transport of glucose into the muscle cells.",
                "To increase the heart rate during the 'fight or flight' response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin is produced by adipose tissue; as fat cells shrink during weight loss, leptin drops, signaling the brain to increase hunger and decrease energy expenditure (adaptive thermogenesis)."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "To optimize the Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio in the Anti-Inflammatory Protocol (L3), what is the target ratio recommended for reducing systemic cellular inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "20:1",

                "Exactly 10:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The modern Western diet is often 15:1 or 20:1. The Anti-Inflammatory Protocol aims for a ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids."
