            "question": "When measuring Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) versus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which of the following statements is true regarding clinical protocols?",
            "options": [
                "BMR requires the subject to be in a post-absorptive state (12-hour fast) and measured immediately upon waking in a controlled environment.",
                "RMR requires more stringent controls than BMR, including overnight stays in a laboratory.",
                "BMR is typically 10-20% higher than RMR due to the thermic effect of food.",
                "RMR and BMR are interchangeable terms with no difference in measurement criteria."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BMR is the most restrictive measurement, requiring a 12-hour fast and measurement immediately upon waking in a darkened, temperature-controlled room. RMR is more common in clinical practice as it allows for a 4-hour fast and travel to the clinic."

            "question": "According to research on Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT), what is the potential variance in daily caloric expenditure between two individuals of similar size based on NEAT alone?",
            "options": [
                "Up to 200 kcal per day",
                "Up to 500 kcal per day",
                "Up to 1,000 kcal per day",
                "Up to 2,000 kcal per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research (Levine et al.) has shown that NEAT can account for a variance of up to 2,000 kcal per day between individuals, making it the most significant variable in Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) outside of RMR."

            "question": "A client undergoes indirect calorimetry and receives a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) result of 0.72. What does this primarily indicate about their substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is almost exclusively burning carbohydrates.",
                "The client is in a state of 'Metabolic Gridlock,' unable to burn fat.",
                "The client is almost exclusively oxidizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The client is utilizing an equal 50/50 mix of fats and carbohydrates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates 100% fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates 100% carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 shows a very high reliance on fat stores, typical of a fasted or ketogenic state."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Metabolic Adaptation' (Adaptive Thermogenesis), studies on 'The Biggest Loser' contestants found that RMR decreased significantly. What was the average RMR deficit below predicted levels years after the competition ended?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 100 kcal/day",
                "Approximately 500 kcal/day",
                "Approximately 800 kcal/day",
                "RMR returned to normal levels within 6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fothergill et al. (2016) found that even six years later, contestants had an RMR that was roughly 500 kcal/day lower than predicted for their body composition, illustrating the persistence of metabolic adaptation."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which predictive equation is currently recognized as the most accurate for calculating RMR in both non-obese and obese individuals in a clinical setting?",
            "options": [
                "Harris-Benedict Equation (1919)",
                "Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (1990)",

                "Cunningham Equation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systematic review of various equations found that the Mifflin-St Jeor equation predicted RMR within 10% of measured value for more participants than other equations, making it the gold standard for clinical use when indirect calorimetry is unavailable."

            "options": [
                "Fats (0-3%)",
                "Carbohydrates (5-10%)",

                "Alcohol (10-15%)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has a significantly higher TEF (20-30%) compared to carbohydrates (5-10%) and fats (0-3%). This means for every 100 calories of protein consumed, 20-30 calories are used just to process the nutrient."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "In the TRANSFORM Metabolic Assessment Protocol, why is 'Insulin Sensitivity' a critical factor in the 'Test' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Because insulin is the primary hormone responsible for muscle protein synthesis.",
                "Because poor insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) inhibits lipolysis and promotes fat storage, regardless of caloric intake.",
                "Because insulin levels determine the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF).",
                "Because insulin is only relevant for clients with Type 2 Diabetes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High circulating insulin levels (Hyperinsulinemia) act as a metabolic switch that signals the body to store energy and inhibits the breakdown of adipose tissue (lipolysis), making weight loss difficult even in a deficit."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Metabolic Flexibility is defined as the body's ability to:",
            "options": [
                "Maintain a high RMR during periods of starvation.",
                "Efficiently switch between oxidizing glucose and oxidizing fatty acids based on availability and demand.",
                "Perform high-intensity exercise for long durations without fatigue.",
                "Absorb micronutrients more efficiently than the average person."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the capacity to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability. A flexible metabolism can switch easily from burning fat (rest/fasted) to burning glucose (post-meal/high intensity)."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which thyroid hormone is the biologically active form that directly regulates the metabolic rate of nearly every cell in the body?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "Thyroxine (T4)",
                "Triiodothyronine (T3)",
                "Reverse T3 (rT3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While T4 is produced in higher quantities, T3 is the active hormone that enters cells and regulates the metabolic rate. T4 must be converted into T3 to be metabolically active."

            "question": "A coach uses the 'TRANSFORM' protocol to assess a client who has been 'plateaued' for 3 months despite eating 1,200 calories. If the coach suspects metabolic adaptation, what is the first step in the 'Test' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately reduce calories to 1,000 to break the plateau.",
                "Increase cardio sessions to 6 days per week.",
                "Establish a baseline by tracking current intake, activity, and measuring RMR to identify the 'gap' between predicted and actual metabolism.",
                "Prescribe a ketogenic diet to improve insulin sensitivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Test' phase of the TRANSFORM protocol requires gathering data first. You cannot manage what you do not measure. Establishing a baseline through tracking and RMR measurement identifies if the plateau is due to metabolic adaptation or lack of adherence."
