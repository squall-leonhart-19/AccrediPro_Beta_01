            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Within the METRIC Method™ framework, the 'T' stands for 'Trophic Factors.' What is the primary focus of this specific pillar?",
            "options": [
                "The timing of nutrient intake relative to circadian rhythms",
                "The nutrient density and hormonal impact of food quality rather than just quantity",
                "The psychological triggers that lead to emotional eating",
                "The mechanical load placed on muscles during resistance training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Trophic pillar focuses on the quality of nutrients and how they signal the body to either build tissue or store energy, moving beyond the 'calorie is a calorie' myth."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3, which component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the most variable between individuals, ranging from 15% to 50% of total energy output?",
            "options": [
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)",
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)",
                "Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NEAT accounts for all physical activity that is not intentional exercise and is the most significant driver of variance in TDEE between individuals of similar sizes."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Physiology of Adipose Tissue, what is the 'Adiposity Rebound' and why is it significant?",
            "options": [
                "The point where fat cells reach maximum size and begin to divide (hyperplasia)",
                "The period in childhood where BMI begins to increase after a period of decline, predicting adult obesity risk",
                "The metabolic surge that occurs after a high-protein meal",
                "The rapid regain of weight following a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adiposity rebound usually occurs around age 5-6; an early rebound is a strong clinical predictor of metabolic challenges and obesity in adulthood."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which hormone, secreted by adipocytes, is responsible for long-term energy balance by signaling the hypothalamus that the body has sufficient energy stores?",
            "options": [
                "Ghrelin",
                "Insulin",
                "Leptin",
                "Cholecystokinin (CCK)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leptin is the 'satiety hormone' produced by fat cells. In obesity, leptin resistance occurs, meaning the brain does not receive the signal that energy stores are adequate."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Lesson 6 details the 'Biggest Loser' study (Fothergill et al., 2016). What was the average reduction in Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) found in participants six years after the competition ended?",
            "options": [
                "RMR returned to baseline levels",
                "RMR was approximately 100 kcal/day lower than predicted",
                "RMR was approximately 500 kcal/day lower than predicted by their body composition",
                "RMR increased due to permanent muscle mass gains"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found significant 'metabolic adaptation,' where participants burned ~500 fewer calories per day than expected for their size, contributing to weight regain."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client presents with a high Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio in their gut microbiome. Based on Lesson 7, what is the most likely physiological outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased efficiency in extracting calories from indigestible fiber",
                "Decreased systemic inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity",
                "Rapid weight loss due to malabsorption of dietary fats",
                "Enhanced production of GLP-1 in the distal colon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes is associated with increased energy harvest from the diet, meaning the individual absorbs more calories from the same amount of food."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "When using the METRIC Method™ Assessment Protocols, why is the Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) considered superior to BMI for assessing health risk?",
            "options": [
                "It is easier to calculate in a clinical setting",
                "It accounts for the weight of bone density in athletes",
                "It specifically identifies visceral adiposity, which is more metabolically active and inflammatory",
                "It measures subcutaneous fat, which is the primary driver of insulin resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "WHR measures central adiposity. Visceral fat (VAT) is highly correlated with metabolic syndrome, whereas BMI cannot distinguish between fat and muscle or fat distribution."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "The 'Carbohydrate-Insulin Model' of obesity, as discussed in Lesson 1, suggests that obesity is primarily a result of:",
            "options": [
                "A simple lack of willpower and excessive caloric intake",
                "Hormonal dysregulation where high-glycemic foods drive insulin, sequestering fat into storage and leaving the body in a state of 'internal starvation'",
                "Genetic mutations in the MC4R gene that prevent any form of weight loss",
                "Environmental toxins that inhibit the thyroid gland's ability to produce T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CIM posits that the hormonal response to food (specifically insulin) is the primary driver of fat storage, which then leads to increased hunger and overeating as a secondary effect."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "During lipogenesis, which enzyme is upregulated by insulin to facilitate the entry of triglycerides into the adipocyte?",
            "options": [
                "Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL)",
                "Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL)",
                "Adenylate Cyclase",
                "Pancreatic Amylase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) sits on the walls of capillaries and pulls fat from the blood into the cells. Insulin increases LPL activity in adipose tissue, promoting fat storage."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "If a client is experiencing 'Metabolic Adaptation' during a weight loss plateau, what is the most appropriate METRIC Method™ intervention based on the Routine (R) pillar?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately decrease caloric intake by another 500 kcal",
                "Increase high-intensity cardiovascular exercise to 7 days per week",
                "Implement a 'Diet Break' or 'Maintenance Phase' to normalize hormonal signaling and RMR",
                "Switch to a liquid-only diet for 14 days to reset the microbiome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The METRIC Method™ advocates for maintenance phases or diet breaks to mitigate the drop in RMR and leptin that occurs during prolonged caloric restriction."
