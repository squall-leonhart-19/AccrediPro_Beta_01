            "question": "Which component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) typically accounts for 60-75% of the total in a sedentary individual?",
            "options": [
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is the largest contributor to TDEE, representing the energy required to maintain vital physiological functions at rest."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) can vary between two individuals of similar size by up to how many calories per day?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by Dr. James Levine, have shown that NEAT can vary by up to 2,000 kcal per day, making it a primary driver of resistance to weight gain or loss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that the body is relying entirely on fatty acids for fuel. An RER of 1.0 would indicate pure carbohydrate oxidation."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "explanation": "Metabolic adaptation can cause a drop in TDEE of up to 500 calories beyond what is expected from the loss of body mass alone, primarily due to decreases in thyroid hormones and leptin.",

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which thyroid hormone is considered the 'active' form that directly regulates mitochondrial oxygen consumption and basal metabolic rate?",
            "options": [
                "TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)",
                "T4 (Thyroxine)",
                "T3 (Triiodothyronine)",
                "Reverse T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the thyroid produces mostly T4, T3 is the active hormone that enters cells and regulates the metabolic rate. Conversion of T4 to T3 often slows during dieting."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client demonstrates 'Metabolic Inflexibility' if they exhibit which of the following symptoms during a fasting state?",
            "options": [
                "A rapid shift to fat oxidation and stable energy levels",
                "An RER that stays near 0.70 regardless of meal timing",

                "High insulin sensitivity and low fasting blood glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the ability to switch fuel sources based on availability. Inflexible individuals struggle to oxidize fat when glucose is low, leading to energy dips."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has a significantly higher TEF (20-30%) compared to carbohydrates (5-10%) and fats (0-3%), which is a key reason high-protein diets aid in weight loss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Normalize' phase ensures the body's 'machinery' is working correctly (micronutrients, sleep, stress) to prevent metabolic stalling during the subsequent fat loss phases."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TDEE = RMR (2,000) x Multiplier (1.5) = 3,000 kcal. To lose 1lb/week, a daily deficit of 500 kcal is required (3,500 / 7). 3,000 - 500 = 2,500 kcal."
