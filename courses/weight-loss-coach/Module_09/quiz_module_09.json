            "question": "During 'The Art of the Pivot' (L1), what is the recommended method for increasing caloric intake to reach maintenance levels without triggering rapid fat regain?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately jump to calculated TDEE to restore metabolic rate",
                "Reverse dieting by adding 50-100 calories per day every week",
                "A 'Reverse Pivot' adding 100-250 calories per week while monitoring weight stability",
                "Maintaining a 500-calorie deficit for an additional 6 months to 'lock in' the weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pivot requires a controlled, incremental increase (usually 100-250 calories per week) to find the actual TDEE, which may be lower than calculators predict due to adaptive thermogenesis."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the Set-Point Theory discussed in Lesson 2, which hormonal shift is primarily responsible for the increased 'hunger drive' following significant weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "A 20-30% increase in circulating Leptin levels",
                "A significant decrease in Leptin and an increase in Ghrelin",
                "A total suppression of Peptide YY and Insulin",
                "A 50% increase in Cortisol paired with low Adrenaline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight loss reduces adipose tissue, leading to lower Leptin (the satiety hormone) and higher Ghrelin (the hunger hormone), creating a biological drive to return to the previous higher set-point."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) shows that what percentage of successful maintainers weigh themselves at least once per week?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 75%",
                "Less than 10% to avoid obsession"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The NWCR data (n=10,000+) indicates that 75% of individuals who successfully maintain a 30lb+ loss for over a year weigh themselves at least weekly to allow for small, rapid corrections."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Adaptive Eating' is contrasted with 'Rigid Control.' Which behavior is a hallmark of Flexible Control associated with long-term success?",
            "options": [
                "Strictly adhering to a 1,200 calorie limit every single day",
                "Compensating for a high-calorie social event by adjusting intake over the following 3-4 days",
                "Eliminating all 'trigger foods' permanently from the household",
                "Using exercise as a direct punishment for eating off-plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flexible control involves viewing nutrition as a weekly average and adjusting for 'real-world' scenarios without the psychological collapse of the 'all-or-nothing' mindset."

            "id": "q9_5",

                "Daily sessions of at least 90 minutes of high-intensity interval training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 150 minutes is standard for general health, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and NWCR data suggest 200–300 minutes are often required to counteract metabolic adaptation in maintenance."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the context of Relapse Prevention (L6), what is the '3-5 Pound Rule'?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of weight a client should expect to lose every month",
                "A predetermined 'action threshold' where the client re-implements strict weight-loss protocols",
                "The maximum amount of muscle mass a client can expect to gain in maintenance",
                "The daily fluctuation caused by glycogen and water retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 3-5 Pound Rule is a proactive boundary. When weight exceeds the maintenance goal by this amount, it triggers an immediate, pre-planned 're-correction' phase to prevent a full relapse."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-Discrepancy Theory explains that if a client still 'identifies' as an overweight person (Actual Self) despite being thin (Ideal Self), the resulting tension often leads to self-sabotage to align their reality with their identity."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Within the T.R.A.N.S.F.O.R.M. Roadmap (L8), what does the 'N' represent in the context of long-term coaching success?",

            "question": "Case Study: Mark has maintained a 40lb loss for 2 years. He experiences a 'lapse' during a two-week vacation, gaining 6lbs. According to Module 9, what is the most effective coaching intervention?",

                "A 3-day water fast to quickly reset his weight",
                "Identifying the lapse as a 'temporary detour' and immediately returning to the maintenance 'Anchor Habits'",
                "Re-enrolling him in the 12-week intensive weight loss phase",
                "Changing his goal weight to accommodate the new 6lbs to reduce stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintenance success relies on distinguishing a 'lapse' (temporary) from a 'relapse' (permanent). Returning to established Anchor Habits prevents the lapse from becoming a total regain."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A 2020 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that the risk of weight regain drops significantly after a client has maintained their loss for how long?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal data indicates that once a individual has successfully maintained weight loss for 2 to 5 years, the chance of long-term success increases from ~20% to over 50% as biology and habits stabilize."
