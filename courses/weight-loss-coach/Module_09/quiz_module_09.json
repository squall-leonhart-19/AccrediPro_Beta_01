            "question": "During the menopausal transition, what is the primary physiological reason for the shift from gynoid (pear-shaped) to android (apple-shaped) fat distribution?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in circulating estradiol levels leading to increased androgenic influence",
                "An increase in progesterone levels stimulating visceral adipose tissue",
                "A decrease in growth hormone leading to reduced muscle protein synthesis",
                "An increase in caloric intake due to changes in ghrelin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The decline in estrogen (specifically estradiol) during menopause reduces the inhibition of fat storage in the abdominal region, leading to an increase in visceral adiposity even if total body weight remains stable."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that what percentage of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) exhibit insulin resistance, regardless of their Body Mass Index (BMI)?",
            "options": [
                "30-40%",
                "50-60%",
                "70-80%",
                "90-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70-80% of women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance, which is a central driver of both the metabolic and reproductive symptoms of the condition."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "For a client with Type 2 Diabetes, at what pre-exercise blood glucose level should a coach recommend consuming 15-30g of carbohydrates to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia?",
            "options": [
                "Below 70 mg/dL",
                "Below 100 mg/dL",
                "Below 126 mg/dL",
                "Below 150 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines suggest that if blood glucose is below 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) prior to exercise, a carbohydrate snack is necessary to ensure safety and prevent hypoglycemia during the session."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When coaching a pediatric client (age 7-12) who is in the 96th percentile for BMI, what is the generally recommended primary goal of the intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid weight loss of 1-2 lbs per week until they reach the 50th percentile",
                "Weight maintenance or slowing the rate of gain while allowing for linear growth",
                "A strict ketogenic diet to reverse insulin resistance immediately",
                "Intermittent fasting to reduce the total feeding window"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In pediatric populations, the goal is often 'growing into their weight.' Restrictive dieting can impair linear growth and cognitive development; therefore, weight maintenance while the child grows taller is the preferred outcome."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Post-bariatric surgery clients are at high risk for 'Dumping Syndrome.' Which nutritional strategy is most effective at mitigating this condition?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing fluid intake during meals to aid digestion",
                "Consuming high-glycemic carbohydrates to maintain energy",
                "Separating liquid and solid intake by at least 30 minutes",
                "Consuming three large meals per day to ensure satiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Separating liquids and solids prevents the rapid gastric emptying that triggers Dumping Syndrome symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and diaphoresis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the aging population (65+), what is the primary risk associated with rapid weight loss without adequate resistance training and protein intake?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of Sarcopenic Obesity and functional decline",
                "Excessive increase in Bone Mineral Density (BMD)",
                "Significant reduction in resting heart rate",
                "Improved insulin sensitivity but reduced cognitive function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sarcopenic obesity occurs when an individual loses muscle mass (sarcopenia) while maintaining or gaining fat. Rapid weight loss in the elderly often results in a 25-30% loss of lean mass if not supported by protein and resistance training."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "When applying the METRIC Method™ to a client with a spinal cord injury (SCI), how should the 'E' (Energy Balance) component be adjusted compared to an able-bodied client?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caloric targets by 10% to account for the stress of injury",
                "Decrease caloric targets by 10-25% due to reduced metabolic activity in paralyzed limbs",
                "Keep caloric targets the same but double the protein intake",
                "Focus exclusively on fats as the primary energy source"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with SCI have significantly lower Basal Metabolic Rates (BMR) due to the loss of metabolically active muscle tissue and reduced sympathetic nervous system activity; thus, caloric requirements are typically 10-25% lower."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "According to the NCEP ATP III criteria, which of the following measurements would contribute to a diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dL in men",
                "Blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg",
                "Fasting glucose of 90 mg/dL",
                "Waist circumference > 40 inches (102 cm) in men"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A waist circumference greater than 40 inches in men (or 35 inches in women) is one of the five diagnostic criteria for Metabolic Syndrome."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "For an athlete using the METRIC Method™, how should the 'T' (Timing) of nutrient intake be prioritized to maximize fat loss while preserving performance?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming all daily calories in a 4-hour evening window",
                "Consuming the majority of daily carbohydrates in the 2-4 hours surrounding training",
                "Avoiding all carbohydrates for 24 hours prior to a competition",
                "Consuming only protein during the post-workout 'anabolic window'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrient timing for athletes focuses on 'fueling for the work required.' Consuming carbohydrates around the training window ensures glycogen availability for performance while allowing for fat oxidation during lower-intensity periods."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A 52-year-old female client presents with 'stubborn' midsection weight gain, night sweats, and high stress. Which intervention aligns best with the coaching protocols for perimenopause?",
            "options": [
                "7 days a week of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "A very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) of 800 calories per day",
                "Increasing protein to 1.2–1.5g/kg and adding 2-3 days of heavy resistance training",
                "Eliminating all dietary fats to reduce caloric density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher protein intake and resistance training are critical during perimenopause to counteract the loss of lean mass and the metabolic slowdown associated with estrogen decline."
