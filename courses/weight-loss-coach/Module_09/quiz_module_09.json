            "question": "During the 'Art of the Pivot' (Lesson 1), what is the primary physiological objective of slowly increasing caloric intake, often referred to as reverse dieting?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize immediate muscle hypertrophy",
                "To restore metabolic rate and hormonal balance while minimizing fat regain",
                "To test the client's willpower against high-calorie 'trigger' foods",
                "To ensure the client reaches a body fat percentage below 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pivot phase focuses on metabolic restoration. By incrementally increasing calories, we aim to reverse metabolic adaptation (thermogenesis) and normalize leptin levels without causing a massive 'rebound' in adipose tissue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the Set-Point Theory discussed in Lesson 2, how do Leptin and Ghrelin typically respond after significant weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin increases and Ghrelin decreases",
                "Both Leptin and Ghrelin increase significantly",
                "Leptin decreases (reducing satiety) and Ghrelin increases (increasing hunger)",
                "Both hormones remain stable while insulin sensitivity improves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weight loss reduces leptin (the satiety hormone produced by fat cells) and increases ghrelin (the hunger hormone), creating a biological 'pull' back toward the original set-point weight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) indicates that what percentage of successful maintainers weigh themselves at least once per week?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 75%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NWCR data shows that consistent self-monitoring is a hallmark of success; 75% of successful maintainers weigh themselves at least once weekly to catch small fluctuations before they become major gains."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A coach implements an 'Action Range' for a client. If the client's goal maintenance weight is 160 lbs, what would be the most professional recommendation if the scale hits 166 lbs?",
            "options": [
                "Initiate a 3-day water fast immediately",
                "Ignore the scale as it is likely just water retention from sodium",
                "Execute the pre-planned 'Correction Protocol' to return to the 160-165 range",
                "Switch the client to a permanent ketogenic diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Action Range (typically 3-5 lbs) allows for normal fluctuations. Once the 'ceiling' is hit (e.g., 166 lbs), the client should implement a pre-determined, non-emotional correction protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, Physical Activity for Preservation, which component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is cited as the most variable and critical for long-term maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)",
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)",
                "Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While BMR is the largest component of TDEE, NEAT is the most variable. Successful maintainers often have high levels of non-exercise movement (walking, standing, fidgeting) which prevents 'energy gap' weight regain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "What is the fundamental difference between a 'Lapse' and a 'Relapse' as defined in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "A lapse is a single event of overeating; a relapse is a sustained return to old patterns",
                "A lapse involves sugar; a relapse involves alcohol",
                "A lapse is intentional; a relapse is accidental",
                "There is no difference; both terms are used interchangeably in clinical settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Distinguishing between a lapse (a temporary slip) and a relapse (a total collapse of the new lifestyle) is vital for preventing the 'What the Heck' effect and maintaining client self-efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Which statement best exemplifies an 'Identity Transformation' (Lesson 7) rather than just a 'Behavioral Change'?",
            "options": [
                "'I am trying to avoid the bread basket tonight.'",
                "'I have to go to the gym because my coach told me to.'",
                "'I am the type of person who doesn't miss workouts because I value my strength.'",
                "'I will lose 5 more pounds so I can fit into my wedding dress.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on who the person *is* (e.g., a person who values strength) rather than what they want to *achieve* (outcome-based), which is the key to permanent maintenance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In the T.R.A.N.S.F.O.R.M. Roadmap (Lesson 8), what does the 'N' stand for regarding the client's long-term success?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrient Density Optimization",
                "Negotiating Non-Negotiables",
                "Negative Calorie Loading",
                "Neurological Habit Re-wiring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Negotiating Non-Negotiables involves helping the client identify the 2-3 behaviors they will never compromise on (e.g., 10k steps or no liquid sugar), providing a safety net for maintenance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that 'Rigid Restraint' (all-or-nothing dieting) compared to 'Flexible Control' (adaptive eating) resulted in:",
            "options": [
                "Higher rates of long-term weight maintenance",
                "Higher levels of disordered eating and increased BMI over time",
                "Better insulin sensitivity but lower muscle mass",
                "No significant difference in weight outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rigid restraint is a significant predictor of weight regain and binge eating. Flexible control (adaptive eating) allows for social events and 'treats,' which paradoxically leads to better long-term adherence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "During the 'Maintenance' phase, if a client experiences 'Post-Diet Hyperphagia,' what is the coach's best evidence-based response?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client they lack willpower and need to try harder",
                "Lower calories further to compensate for the hunger",
                "Explain that this is a biological drive to restore energy stores and focus on high-satiety, low-energy-density foods",
                "Prescribe an immediate 'cheat day' to satisfy the cravings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperphagia is a biological response to the energy gap. Coaches must normalize this experience for the client and pivot to volume-eating strategies (high fiber/protein) to manage the physiological hunger drive."
