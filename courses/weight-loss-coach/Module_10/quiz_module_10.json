            "question": "A client states, 'I really want to lose weight to keep up with my kids, but I just don't have time to cook healthy meals.' In Motivational Interviewing (MI), how is the first part of this sentence ('I really want to lose weight...') classified?",
            "options": [
                "Sustain Talk",
                "Change Talk",
                "Discord",
                "The Righting Reflex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Change talk is any self-expressed language that argues for change. In this case, the desire to keep up with children is a 'Desire' component of DARN-CAT (Desire, Ability, Reasons, Need)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients in Contemplation are aware of the problem but ambivalent. Decisional balance helps them process the pros and cons of change to tip the scales toward the Preparation stage."

            "question": "A 2005 meta-analysis by Rubak et al. involving 72 randomized controlled trials found that Motivational Interviewing (MI) outperformed traditional advice-giving in what percentage of studies?",

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "A client becomes defensive and 'non-compliant' when you suggest tracking calories. Instead of arguing, you respond: 'It sounds like the idea of tracking feels very restrictive and overwhelming right now.' Which MI technique are you using?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rolling with resistance involves using reflections to acknowledge the client's perspective rather than meeting resistance with confrontation, which reduces the 'Righting Reflex.'"

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "It is always more expensive than face-to-face coaching",
                "It allows the client to reflect and respond when they are in a 'cool' emotional state",
                "It eliminates the need for the coach to have professional empathy",
                "It guarantees 100% weight loss success regardless of client effort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynchronous communication allows for 'pause and reflect' time, helping clients process information and respond thoughtfully rather than impulsively during high-stress moments."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Socratic questioning helps the client arrive at a more realistic conclusion themselves by exploring the evidence and consequences of their expectations, maintaining rapport while managing 'False Hope Syndrome.'"
