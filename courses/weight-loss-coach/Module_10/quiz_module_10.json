            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which physiological phenomenon refers to the decrease in Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) that exceeds what can be accounted for by the loss of body mass alone?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolic Flexibility",
                "Adaptive Thermogenesis",
                "The Thermic Effect of Activity",
                "Anabolic Resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis is the body's defense mechanism against weight loss, where the metabolic rate drops further than expected based on the new, smaller body size, often due to hormonal shifts (e.g., lower T3 and leptin)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Reverse Dieting,' what is the primary clinical objective of incrementally increasing caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize adipose tissue hyperplasia",
                "To restore metabolic rate and hormonal balance while minimizing fat regain",
                "To prepare the client for an immediate secondary fat-loss phase",
                "To ensure the client reaches a 20% body fat increase for safety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse dieting aims to slowly increase calories to 're-prime' the metabolism and normalize hormones like leptin and thyroid hormones without triggering a massive fat-gain rebound."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), what percentage of successful weight-loss maintainers report eating breakfast every day?",
            "options": [
                "42%",
                "55%",
                "78%",
                "94%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The NWCR found that 78% of participants who successfully maintained a 30lb+ weight loss for over a year reported eating breakfast daily, suggesting it helps with appetite regulation throughout the day."

            "id": "q10_4",

            "options": [
                "1-2 lbs",
                "3-5 lbs (or roughly 2-3% of body weight)",

                "Any increase in body fat percentage over 1%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 3-5 lb buffer allows for normal glycogen and water fluctuations while providing a clear 'line in the sand' where the client must re-engage more structured protocols."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client uses the statement: 'If I am at a birthday party and cake is served, then I will have three small bites and then grab a glass of sparkling water.' This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (If-Then planning) automate decision-making in high-risk situations, reducing the reliance on willpower during the maintenance phase."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "How does the 'Relapse Prevention Model' distinguish between a 'lapse' and a 'relapse'?",
            "options": [
                "A lapse is a temporary slip in behavior; a relapse is a return to the original problem pattern",
                "A lapse involves weight gain; a relapse involves only psychological stress",
                "A lapse is intentional; a relapse is accidental",
                "There is no functional difference in a coaching context"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Distinguishing between the two prevents the 'Abstinence Violation Effect,' where a single slip (lapse) leads the client to give up entirely (relapse)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Banking Method (or calorie banking) allows for social flexibility by adjusting the weekly energy balance rather than focusing strictly on a 24-hour window."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Research on successful maintainers shows that high levels of physical activity are critical. What is the average daily duration of moderate-intensity activity reported by NWCR members?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Successful maintainers in the NWCR typically engage in approximately 60 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (like brisk walking) daily."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Fading' technique during the Coach’s Exit Strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the frequency of sessions to maximize final billing",
                "To gradually reduce the frequency of contact to build the client's self-efficacy",
                "To stop all communication immediately once the goal weight is reached",
                "To transition the client into a high-intensity muscle-building phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fading (e.g., moving from weekly to bi-weekly, then monthly sessions) allows the coach to provide a safety net while the client practices autonomous maintenance."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client in maintenance feels 'burnt out' on tracking macros but fears weight regain. Which transition strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Force the client to track for another 12 months to ensure safety",
                "Transition to 'Habit-Based Tracking' or 'Internal Cues' using a tiered approach",
                "Advise the client to stop all forms of monitoring immediately",
                "Switch the client to a rigid meal plan to remove decision fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transitioning from external tools (apps) to internal cues (hunger/satiety) and habit-based tracking (e.g., palm-sized portions) is essential for long-term lifestyle integration."
