            "question": "Research by Rosenbaum et al. (2008) indicates that following a 10% weight loss, Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) often drops by how much beyond what is predicted by the loss of body mass alone?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2-3%",
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "It does not drop; it stays proportional to body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis accounts for a 10-15% reduction in TDEE beyond predicted metabolic slowing, making maintenance physiologically challenging compared to a person who was always at that lower weight."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Reverse Dieting,' what is the primary physiological objective of incrementally increasing caloric intake by 50-100 kcal per week?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize muscle hypertrophy during a caloric surplus",
                "To shock the metabolism into a fat-burning state",
                "To upregulate NEAT and restore hormonal signaling while minimizing fat regain",
                "To ensure the client reaches a 4,000 calorie baseline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reverse dieting aims to slowly restore metabolic rate, thyroid function, and leptin levels while keeping the caloric increase small enough that the body 'burns' the extra energy through increased NEAT rather than storing it as fat."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), what percentage of successful long-term maintainers report weighing themselves at least once per week?",

                "25%",
                "45%",
                "75%",
                "95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 75% of successful maintainers in the NWCR weigh themselves at least once a week, providing a critical feedback loop for self-regulation."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "A client experiences a single 'over-eating' event at a wedding and immediately thinks, 'I've ruined everything, I might as well keep eating until Monday.' This cognitive distortion is known as:",
            "options": [
                "The Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE)",
                "The Metabolic Tipping Point",

                "The Anchoring Bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE) occurs when a lapse in behavior leads to feelings of loss of control and guilt, which often results in a full-blown relapse."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "When designing a 'Weight Maintenance Buffer,' what is the recommended range for a client to fluctuate within before triggering a structured 'Correction Protocol'?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 lb",
                "3 - 5 lbs",
                "10 - 15 lbs",
                "A maintenance buffer is not recommended as it encourages weight gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 3-5 lb weight range (or buffer) allows for normal physiological fluctuations (glycogen, water, inflammation) without causing unnecessary panic, while providing a clear 'red flag' limit for intervention."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which behavioral strategy involves creating an 'If-Then' plan (e.g., 'If the restaurant doesn't have a salad, then I will order double steamed vegetables') to automate decision-making?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions are highly effective for maintenance because they reduce the 'decision fatigue' associated with high-risk social or environmental situations."

                "Low protein, low glycemic index"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of high protein (approx. 25% of energy) and low glycemic index foods was shown to be superior for weight maintenance and satiety in the large-scale Diogenes trial."

            "id": "q10_8",

            "options": [
                "Daily check-ins and strict macro tracking",
                "A transition from external tracking to internal hunger/satiety cues with bi-weekly check-ins",
                "The client being left entirely alone without any contact",
                "Returning to the original deficit to ensure more weight is lost"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stability involves fading the coach's presence and the client's reliance on apps, moving toward 'intuitive eating with guardrails' while maintaining infrequent professional check-ins."

            "id": "q10_9",

                "Reaching the goal weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unstructured time and negative emotional states (stress, boredom, loneliness) are primary triggers for relapse, necessitating the development of non-food coping mechanisms."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended 'Protein Floor' for a client in the Forever Plan to ensure satiety and preserve Lean Body Mass (LBM)?",
            "options": [
                "0.4g per kg of body weight",
                "0.8g per kg of body weight",
                "1.6g to 2.2g per kg of body weight",
                "Protein intake does not matter in maintenance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain satiety and protect metabolic rate through LBM preservation, a protein floor of 1.6g to 2.2g per kg (approx. 0.7-1.0g/lb) is the clinical gold standard for maintenance."
