            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which neurological pathway is primarily responsible for 'hedonic hunger' and the drive to consume hyper-palatable foods regardless of energy needs?",
            "options": [
                "The homeostatic pathway in the hypothalamus",
                "The mesolimbic dopamine system (reward pathway)",
                "The glycemic-insulin axis",
                "The vagus nerve signaling pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the hypothalamus regulates homeostatic hunger (energy needs), the mesolimbic dopamine system drives hedonic hunger—the desire to eat for pleasure, often triggered by cues associated with sugar, salt, and fat."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the research discussed in Lesson 3, how does chronic cortisol elevation specifically contribute to abdominal adiposity?",
            "options": [
                "By decreasing total caloric expenditure by 15%",
                "By increasing the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) specifically in visceral fat cells",
                "By inhibiting the absorption of dietary fiber in the small intestine",
                "By stimulating the thyroid to overproduce T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme that promotes fat storage. Visceral (abdominal) fat cells have more glucocorticoid receptors, making them particularly sensitive to cortisol-induced fat accumulation."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client states: 'I ate a piece of pizza at the office party, so I've already failed my diet for the day. I might as well eat whatever I want tonight and start again Monday.' This is a classic example of which cognitive distortion?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Reasoning",
                "Magnification",
                "All-or-Nothing (Dichotomous) Thinking",
                "Personalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "All-or-nothing thinking involves seeing situations in black-and-white categories. In weight management, this often leads to the 'What-the-Hell Effect,' where a minor slip results in total abandonment of goals for the remainder of the period."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of Mindful Eating (Lesson 5), approximately how long does it take for satiety signals like Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Peptide YY (PYY) to reach the brain after the start of a meal?",
            "options": [
                "5 minutes",
                "10 minutes",
                "20 minutes",
                "45 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "There is a physiological lag of approximately 20 minutes between the ingestion of food and the brain's reception of satiety signals. Eating faster than this window often leads to overconsumption before the 'fullness' signal is processed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Based on the study by Lally et al. (2010) regarding habit formation, what is the average time required for a new health behavior to reach peak automaticity?",
            "options": [
                "21 days",
                "30 days",
                "66 days",
                "120 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the '21-day' myth is common, Lally's research demonstrated that it takes an average of 66 days for a new behavior to become an automatic habit, with a range of 18 to 254 days depending on complexity."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When utilizing the HALT acronym to identify emotional eating triggers, what do the letters represent?",
            "options": [
                "Habitual, Anxious, Low-energy, Targeted",
                "Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HALT is a foundational tool in emotional regulation coaching that helps clients distinguish between physiological hunger and emotional prompts: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios falls OUTSIDE the Weight Loss Coach's scope of practice and requires an immediate referral to a licensed mental health professional?",
            "options": [
                "A client who eats chocolate when they are stressed at work",
                "A client who struggles to lose weight due to a slow metabolism",
                "A client who reports frequent episodes of eating large quantities of food followed by self-induced vomiting",
                "A client who wants to learn how to use a hunger-satiety scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, or excessive exercise to 'purge' calories are clinical indicators of an eating disorder (e.g., Bulimia Nervosa) and must be referred to a specialist."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What happens to dopamine D2 receptors in the brain's reward center following chronic overconsumption of hyper-palatable foods (the 'Downregulation' effect)?",
            "options": [
                "The number of receptors increases, making the person more sensitive to food",
                "The number of receptors decreases, requiring more food to achieve the same 'reward' sensation",
                "The receptors change shape to only accept glucose",
                "The receptors migrate from the brain to the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic overstimulation of the reward system leads to the downregulation (reduction) of D2 receptors. This creates a tolerance effect where the individual needs larger amounts of highly palatable food to experience the same level of pleasure."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "In Cognitive Behavioral Coaching (CBC), the 'Cognitive Triangle' illustrates the reciprocal relationship between which three elements?",
            "options": [
                "Genetics, Environment, and Metabolism",
                "Calories In, Calories Out, and Hormones",
                "Thoughts, Feelings, and Behaviors",
                "Past, Present, and Future"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cognitive Triangle is a core CBC concept showing how our Thoughts influence our Feelings, which drive our Behaviors (and vice versa). Changing the thought pattern is the primary lever for changing the behavior."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client has reached a weight loss plateau and is becoming highly self-critical. According to Lesson 6 on Resilience, which strategy is most effective for long-term maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the intensity of the caloric deficit immediately",
                "Implementing 'Self-Compassion' techniques to reduce the cortisol response to failure",
                "Switching to a completely different diet protocol to 'shock' the system",
                "Setting a goal to lose double the weight the following week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that self-compassion is a stronger predictor of diet adherence than self-criticism. Reducing the shame response helps lower cortisol and prevents the 'What-the-Hell' effect, allowing the client to return to their plan more quickly."
