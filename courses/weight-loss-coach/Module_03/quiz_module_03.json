        {
            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to weight gain primarily by disrupting signaling for which 'satiety' hormone, leading to leptin resistance?",
            "options": ["Ghrelin", "Leptin", "Cortisol", "Adiponectin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha cross the blood-brain barrier and interfere with leptin signaling in the hypothalamus, causing the brain to miss 'fullness' signals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which specific compound, formed when proteins or fats combine with sugars at high temperatures, is a potent trigger for the RAGE receptor and systemic inflammation?",
            "options": ["Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)", "Omega-9 Fatty Acids", "Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs)", "Phytic Acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-products) bind to RAGE (Receptor for AGEs), triggering a signaling cascade that increases oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Anti-Inflammatory Plate' pillars, what is the recommended minimum daily intake of fiber to support the clearance of inflammatory metabolites?",
            "options": ["15-20 grams", "25-35 grams", "45-55 grams", "60+ grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A target of 25-35g of fiber (specifically focusing on soluble and prebiotic fibers) is essential for gut motility and feeding the anti-inflammatory microbiome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the 'Gut-Inflammation Axis,' what is the term for the process where Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) leak through a compromised intestinal barrier into the bloodstream?",
            "options": ["Metabolic Endotoxemia", "Bacterial Fermentation", "Glycemic Variability", "Phytonutrient Translocation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia occurs when LPS from Gram-negative bacteria enter systemic circulation, causing a 2-3 fold increase in baseline inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "While the standard Western diet often reaches ratios of 15:1 or 20:1, what is the optimal Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio for reducing chronic inflammation?",
            "options": ["10:1", "1:1 to 4:1", "1:5", "15:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that keeping the ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 is optimal for reducing the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Why is Glycemic Load (GL) considered a superior metric to Glycemic Index (GI) when coaching clients on the Anti-Inflammatory Protocol?",
            "options": ["GI only measures how fast sugar rises, while GL accounts for the total carbohydrate amount per serving.", "GI is only for diabetics, while GL is for weight loss.", "GL measures the insulin response, while GI only measures glucose.", "There is no difference between the two metrics."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Glycemic Load provides a more accurate real-world picture because it calculates the impact of a typical serving size, not just a standardized 50g of carbohydrates."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "The phytonutrient Sulforaphane, found in broccoli sprouts, is highly valued in anti-inflammatory nutrition because it activates which cellular pathway?",
            "options": ["mTOR", "Nrf2", "NF-kB", "AMPK"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane activates the Nrf2 pathway, which is the body's master antioxidant switch, triggering the production of endogenous enzymes like glutathione."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client presents with a high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) level of 4.2 mg/L. How would you interpret this based on the clinical guidelines in the module?",
            "options": ["Low risk; no intervention needed.", "Average risk; focus only on exercise.", "High risk; indicates significant systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk.", "Acute infection; wait 24 hours and retest."],
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP level over 3.0 mg/L is clinically categorized as high risk for cardiovascular events and indicative of chronic systemic inflammation.",
            "correctAnswer": 2
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When implementing the Anti-Inflammatory Protocol, what is the 'Crowding Out' method?",
            "options": ["Eating as much food as possible in a short window.", "Focusing on adding nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory foods so there is less 'room' for pro-inflammatory triggers.", "Eliminating all fats and carbohydrates simultaneously.", "Counting every calorie to ensure a deficit."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crowding out is a psychological and physiological strategy where adding high-fiber, high-volume anti-inflammatory foods naturally displaces processed, pro-inflammatory options."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis of Mediterranean-style anti-inflammatory diets showed that these interventions can reduce C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": ["2-5%", "15-20%", "45-50%", "75-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show that high-adherence anti-inflammatory diets result in a 15-20% reduction in CRP, alongside significant improvements in IL-6."
