        {
            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which chronic low-grade inflammation (meta-inflammation) promotes insulin resistance and fat storage?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of ghrelin in the stomach",
                "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha interfere with insulin signaling at the receptor level",
                "By decreasing the body's core temperature and metabolic rate",
                "By stimulating the rapid conversion of protein into glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic inflammation leads to the release of cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, which disrupt the insulin signaling pathway, preventing glucose from entering cells efficiently and promoting fat storage."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary compounds is a 'pro-inflammatory trigger' formed when sugars react with proteins or fats during high-heat cooking (e.g., grilling or frying)?",
            "options": [
                "Polyphenols",
                "Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs)",
                "Sulforaphane",
                "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AGEs are inflammatory compounds that form through the Maillard reaction. High levels of circulating AGEs are linked to increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Core Pillars' of the Anti-Inflammatory Plate, what is the recommended proportion of non-starchy vegetables per meal?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10% of the plate",
                "Exactly 25% of the plate",
                "At least 50% of the plate",
                "Vegetables should only be consumed at dinner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The anti-inflammatory plate emphasizes a high volume of phytonutrients and fiber; filling 50% of the plate with non-starchy vegetables ensures a high density of antioxidants to combat inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the Gut-Inflammation Axis, which endotoxin can leak into the bloodstream due to increased intestinal permeability, causing 'metabolic endotoxemia'?",
            "options": [
                "Lactobacillus",
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",
                "Butyrate",
                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS are components of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls. When the gut barrier is compromised, LPS enters the blood, triggering a systemic inflammatory response and promoting adipose tissue inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "The modern Western diet often reaches an Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio of 20:1. What is the target therapeutic ratio for an anti-inflammatory protocol?",
            "options": [
                "50:1",
                "Between 1:1 and 4:1",
                "Exactly 15:1",
                "Omega-6 should be 0:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 is considered ideal for human health. High Omega-6 intake promotes pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, while Omega-3s produce anti-inflammatory resolving mediators."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Why is Glycemic Load (GL) a superior metric to Glycemic Index (GI) when coaching for an anti-inflammatory lifestyle?",
            "options": [
                "GL only measures the speed of sugar absorption",
                "GL accounts for both the quality and the total quantity of carbohydrates in a typical serving",
                "GI is only relevant for diabetic patients",
                "GL ignores the presence of fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While GI measures how quickly a food raises blood sugar, GL provides a more accurate picture of the total glucose load, which is critical for preventing the insulin spikes that drive inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a potent isothiocyanate that triggers the body's natural antioxidant defenses via the Nrf2 pathway, helping to neutralize inflammatory triggers."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "During the 'Implementation Phase' of an anti-inflammatory protocol, what is the standard duration for the initial elimination of common triggers like gluten and dairy?",

                "48 hours",
                "7 days",
                "21 to 28 days",
                "3 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It typically takes 21 to 28 days for the immune system to 'quiet down' and for antibodies to decrease, allowing the coach and client to accurately assess the impact of these foods."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client's bloodwork shows a High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) level of 4.2 mg/L. How should a coach interpret this data?",
            "options": [
                "This is an optimal level indicating zero inflammation",
                "This indicates a high risk/elevated state of systemic inflammation",
                "This is only relevant if the client has a cold",
                "This level is too low and suggests immune suppression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP level above 3.0 mg/L is generally considered high risk for cardiovascular disease and is a clinical marker for systemic chronic inflammation."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) is produced by gut bacteria from fermentable fibers and serves as the primary energy source for colonocytes to maintain gut barrier integrity?",

                "Acetate",
                "Butyrate",
                "Propionate",
                "Linoleic Acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is essential for gut health; it strengthens the mucosal barrier and has direct anti-inflammatory effects in the colon, preventing the 'leaky gut' that leads to systemic inflammation."
