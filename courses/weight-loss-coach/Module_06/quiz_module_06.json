            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, macronutrient partitioning for body recomposition emphasizes protein intake. What is the evidence-based range recommended to preserve lean mass during a caloric deficit?",
            "options": ["0.8 - 1.2g per kg of body weight", "1.6 - 2.2g per kg of body weight", "2.5 - 3.5g per kg of body weight", "0.5 - 0.7g per kg of body weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 1.6 to 2.2g/kg of protein is the 'sweet spot' for maximizing muscle protein synthesis and sparing lean tissue while in a negative energy balance."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "The concept of 'Hidden Hunger' discussed in Lesson 2 refers to which physiological state?",
            "options": ["Psychological cravings for ultra-processed foods", "Ghrelin spikes caused by sleep deprivation", "Micronutrient deficiencies despite a surplus or adequacy of macronutrient calories", "The drop in blood glucose 2 hours after a high-carb meal"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hidden hunger occurs when a diet is high in energy (calories) but low in essential vitamins and minerals, leading to metabolic inefficiency and persistent hunger signals."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to the Holt et al. Satiety Index (Lesson 3), which of these foods produced the highest satiety score per 240-calorie serving?",
            "options": ["Croissants", "Brown Rice", "Boiled Potatoes", "Beef"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boiled potatoes scored the highest on the Satiety Index (323%), significantly higher than white bread (100%) and even high-protein foods like fish or steak."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 explains how fiber and hydration contribute to satiety through 'Gastric Distension.' Which nerve is primarily responsible for signaling fullness to the brain when the stomach walls stretch?",
            "options": ["Sciatic Nerve", "Vagus Nerve", "Trigeminal Nerve", "Phrenic Nerve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mechanoreceptors in the stomach wall detect physical stretching (distension) and send signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brain via the Vagus nerve."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the Lichtman et al. study on tracking accuracy revealed that some individuals underreport their actual caloric intake by as much as:",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "30-50%", "Over 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found significant discrepancies in self-reporting, with some participants underestimating intake by 47% and overestimating physical activity by 51%."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Applying 'Choice Architecture' from Lesson 6, which of the following is an example of a 'Nudge' to improve nutritional adherence?",
            "options": ["Writing a detailed 7-day meal plan for a client", "Placing pre-cut vegetables at eye-level in the refrigerator", "Charging a client a fee for missing a coaching session", "Explaining the biochemistry of insulin resistance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nudging involves designing the environment to make the desired behavior the path of least resistance, such as increasing the visibility and accessibility of healthy foods."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "When managing social dining (Lesson 7), the 'Pre-loading Strategy' involves consuming what before arriving at a restaurant to improve decision-making?",
            "options": ["A high-sugar energy drink", "A 100-200 calorie high-protein or high-fiber snack", "A glass of dry wine", "Nothing; saving all calories for the meal"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pre-loading with protein or fiber (like a protein shake or an apple) stabilizes blood glucose and dampens ghrelin, preventing 'impulse ordering' driven by extreme hunger."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 8, which supplement has a 'Level A' evidence rating for moderately increasing fat oxidation and metabolic rate?",
            "options": ["Raspberry Ketones", "Garcinia Cambogia", "Caffeine", "Green Coffee Bean Extract"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Caffeine is one of the few supplements with robust evidence showing it can increase metabolic rate by 3-11% and enhance fat burning during exercise."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'volume' and feels empty after meals. According to Lesson 4, which fiber type is most effective at increasing bolus viscosity and slowing gastric emptying?",
            "options": ["Insoluble fiber (e.g., wheat bran)", "Soluble/Viscous fiber (e.g., glucomannan or oats)", "Synthetic fiber (e.g., polydextrose)", "Resistant starch"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soluble, viscous fibers form a gel-like substance in the gut, which slows the transit of food and prolongs the duration of nutrient absorption and satiety signals."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Intuitive Precision' is described as a transitional phase in tracking. What is its primary goal?",
            "options": ["To track every gram of food for the rest of the client's life", "To use internal hunger cues while maintaining the external data awareness developed during tracking", "To ignore all data and eat based only on emotional cravings", "To replace all whole foods with standardized meal replacement shakes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intuitive Precision is the goal of weight loss coaching: moving the client from obsessive tracking to a state where they can maintain their weight using internal cues informed by their previous data-driven education."
