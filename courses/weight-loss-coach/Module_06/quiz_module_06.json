            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "Which enzyme, discussed in Lesson 4, is primarily responsible for converting inactive cortisone into active cortisol within visceral adipose tissue, effectively creating 'local' stress in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1)",
                "Aromatase",
                "Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL)",
                "5-alpha reductase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "11β-HSD1 is the 'gatekeeper' of cortisol in fat cells; its upregulation in visceral fat explains why stressed individuals often gain weight in the midsection even without high systemic cortisol levels."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 3.5. Based on the Insulin Management lesson, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "The client is highly insulin sensitive.",
                "The client is in the optimal range for fat loss.",
                "The client demonstrates significant insulin resistance.",
                "The client has Type 1 Diabetes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 (like 3.5) indicate significant insulin resistance that requires metabolic intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Leptin & Ghrelin' lesson, why does leptin resistance lead to a 'starvation signal' in the brain despite high body fat levels?",
            "options": [
                "The stomach stops producing ghrelin entirely.",
                "Leptin cannot cross the blood-brain barrier or bind to receptors in the hypothalamus.",
                "Leptin levels are too low in obese individuals.",
                "Leptin is converted into estrogen in the adipose tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In leptin resistance, the brain (specifically the hypothalamus) fails to 'see' the high levels of leptin, leading it to believe the body is starving and subsequently slowing metabolism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "During a period of extreme caloric restriction, the 'Metabolic Thermostat' (Thyroid) protects the body by doing which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "Increasing the production of Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "Lowering Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) to zero.",
                "Upregulating Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 (rT3) acts as a 'brake' on metabolism; during stress or starvation, the body increases rT3 to block T3 receptors and conserve energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In the context of PCOS and sex hormones, what is the primary mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia leads to 'Follicular Arrest' and weight gain?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin stimulates the ovaries to produce excess androgens (testosterone).",
                "Insulin suppresses the production of progesterone in the adrenals.",
                "Insulin causes the thyroid to stop producing T4.",
                "Insulin increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels stimulate the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, which disrupts the menstrual cycle and promotes abdominal weight gain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Growth Hormone (GH) is a potent 'fat-burning ally.' According to Lesson 7, which physiological state triggers the largest natural pulse of GH?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-protein meal.",
                "Steady-state cardio for 60 minutes.",
                "Deep Stage 3/4 NREM sleep.",
                "Post-prandial insulin spikes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70% of daily Growth Hormone is secreted during deep sleep. Disrupting sleep cycles is a primary cause of GH deficiency and subsequent fat gain."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Glucagon is described as the 'antagonistic partner' to insulin. What is its primary function regarding fat metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It signals the liver to store more glucose as glycogen.",
                "It stimulates Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL) to trigger lipolysis.",
                "It inhibits the use of fatty acids for fuel.",
                "It increases the storage of triglycerides in subcutaneous fat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucagon is the 'mobilization' hormone; it activates Hormone-Sensitive Lipase, which breaks down stored triglycerides into free fatty acids for energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In the TRANSFORM Hormonal Harmony Protocol, what does the 'N' stand for, and what is its practical application?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrient Density; focusing on micronutrients over calories.",
                "Nightly Fasting; implementing a 12-14 hour window to lower insulin.",
                "Neuroendocrine Balance; using adaptogens to lower cortisol.",
                "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT); increasing daily steps."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in the TRANSFORM protocol stands for Nightly Fasting, which is essential for clearing insulin and allowing Glucagon and Growth Hormone to dominate during the night."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study cited in the module showed that individuals with high visceral adiposity had a significantly higher density of which receptors compared to subcutaneous fat?",
            "options": [
                "Glucagon receptors",
                "Leptin receptors",
                "Glucocorticoid receptors",
                "Thyroid hormone receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visceral fat has a higher density of glucocorticoid (cortisol) receptors, making it much more sensitive to stress-induced fat storage than other fat deposits."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When addressing 'Metabolic Resistance' in Lesson 2, which dietary strategy was highlighted as the most effective for lowering the Insulin-to-Glucagon ratio?",
            "options": [
                "High-carb, low-fat diets with 6 small meals a day.",
                "Ketogenic or low-carb diets with intermittent fasting.",
                "Vegan diets focusing on high-fiber grains.",
                "Moderate calorie restriction with high-fructose fruit snacks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lowering carbohydrate intake and increasing the time between meals directly lowers insulin and raises glucagon, shifting the body from 'storage mode' to 'burning mode.'"
