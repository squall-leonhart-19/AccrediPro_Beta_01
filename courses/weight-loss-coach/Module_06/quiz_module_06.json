            "question": "Which biochemical marker is considered the 'gold standard' for identifying early-stage insulin resistance before fasting glucose levels become elevated?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c)",
                "HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)",
                "Post-prandial glucose at 2 hours",
                "Fasting triglyceride levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR calculates the relationship between fasting insulin and fasting glucose. It identifies 'metabolic resistance' often years before blood sugar rises, as the body may be overproducing insulin to maintain normal glucose levels."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Leptin Resistance,' why do individuals with higher body fat percentages often experience increased hunger despite having high circulating leptin?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin is destroyed by stomach acid in obese individuals.",
                "High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) block leptin from crossing the blood-brain barrier and binding to receptors in the hypothalamus.",
                "Leptin is converted into ghrelin in the presence of visceral fat.",
                "The body stops producing leptin once a certain body fat threshold is reached."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin resistance occurs when the hypothalamus fails to receive the 'satiety signal.' Inflammatory markers like CRP can bind to leptin, preventing it from crossing the blood-brain barrier, leading the brain to believe the body is starving."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Research indicates that chronic elevation of cortisol promotes 'visceral adiposity' primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the activity of the enzyme 11β-HSD1 in omental fat tissue.",
                "Decreasing the production of digestive enzymes in the pancreas.",
                "Directly converting muscle tissue into glucose via lipogenesis.",
                "Inhibiting the release of ghrelin from the stomach lining."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) converts inactive cortisone to active cortisol within fat cells. Visceral fat has a higher density of these receptors, meaning stress specifically targets fat storage in the midsection."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH levels but struggles with weight loss, cold intolerance, and thinning hair. What is the most likely hormonal explanation discussed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive T4 production causing hyperthyroidism.",
                "Poor peripheral conversion of T4 (inactive) to T3 (active) or high Reverse T3 levels.",
                "Primary hypothyroidism requiring immediate surgical intervention.",
                "Overactive parathyroid glands affecting calcium metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TSH only measures the pituitary's signal. Weight loss resistance is often caused by 'Subclinical Hypothyroidism' where TSH is normal, but the body fails to convert T4 into the metabolically active T3, or produces too much Reverse T3 (the 'brake' on metabolism)."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), what is the primary driver of the 'hormonal weight gain' cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Low levels of testosterone leading to muscle wasting.",
                "High progesterone causing excessive water retention.",
                "Hyperinsulinemia stimulating the ovaries to produce excess androgens, which further promotes abdominal fat storage.",
                "A complete lack of estrogen production in the adrenal glands."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PCOS is fundamentally a metabolic-endocrine disorder. High insulin levels signal the ovaries to overproduce testosterone/androgens. These androgens promote visceral fat, which in turn increases insulin resistance, creating a self-perpetuating cycle."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "According to the 'TRANSFORM Hormonal Harmony Protocol,' which lifestyle intervention is most effective for naturally boosting Growth Hormone (GH) and Glucagon levels?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-carbohydrate meal 30 minutes before bed.",
                "Intermittent fasting and high-intensity interval training (HIIT).",
                "Chronic low-intensity steady-state cardio (LISS) for 2+ hours daily.",
                "Reducing total protein intake to less than 10% of daily calories."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Growth Hormone and Glucagon are 'fat-burning allies' that are suppressed by insulin. Fasting (low insulin environment) and HIIT (physiological stressor) are the most potent natural stimulators of GH and Glucagon secretion."

            "question": "A 2004 study by Spiegel et al. demonstrated that restricting sleep to 4 hours for just two nights resulted in which specific hormonal change?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% increase in leptin and 10% decrease in ghrelin.",
                "An 18% decrease in leptin and a 28% increase in ghrelin.",
                "No change in hunger hormones, only a decrease in metabolic rate.",
                "A total shutdown of the thyroid gland."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that short sleep duration significantly alters hunger signaling, specifically decreasing the 'fullness' hormone (leptin) by 18% and increasing the 'hunger' hormone (ghrelin) by 28%, leading to increased cravings for calorie-dense foods."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which hormone acts as the 'Metabolic Thermostat' and is most sensitive to prolonged, extreme caloric restriction?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen",
                "Triiodothyronine (T3)",
                "Melatonin",
                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 is the active thyroid hormone that regulates Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). When calories are restricted too aggressively for too long, the body downregulates T3 production to conserve energy, leading to a 'stalled' metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "What is the primary role of the hormone Adiponectin in body weight regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It signals the brain to increase appetite when fat stores are low.",
                "It increases insulin sensitivity and enhances fatty acid oxidation (fat burning).",
                "It promotes the storage of glucose as triglycerides in the liver.",
                "It triggers the 'fight or flight' response during exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin is a beneficial adipokine secreted by fat cells. Higher levels are associated with better insulin sensitivity and easier weight management. Levels typically decrease as body fat increases, making weight loss harder."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "In the TRANSFORM protocol, if a client has high stress (Cortisol) and high insulin, what is the recommended priority of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Start with a 3-day water fast to reset all hormones simultaneously.",
                "Prescribe heavy weightlifting 6 days a week to burn off the cortisol.",
                "Address the 'Metabolic Floor' by stabilizing insulin through nutrition while implementing nervous system regulation to lower cortisol.",
                "Focus exclusively on thyroid medication before changing diet or lifestyle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The TRANSFORM protocol emphasizes a hierarchical approach. Stabilizing insulin (the master storage hormone) and managing cortisol (the stress hormone that drives insulin resistance) are the foundational steps before moving to more aggressive fat-loss strategies."
