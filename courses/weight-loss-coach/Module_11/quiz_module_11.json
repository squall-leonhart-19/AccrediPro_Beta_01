            "question": "During the first 7-14 days of a Ketogenic diet, a client loses 8 lbs. Based on clinical applications discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary physiological driver of this rapid initial weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "Accelerated adipose tissue oxidation",
                "Depletion of glycogen stores and subsequent release of bound water",
                "Increased thermic effect of high protein intake",
                "Spontaneous reduction in caloric intake due to appetite suppression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Each gram of glycogen is stored with approximately 3-4 grams of water. When transitioning to a ketogenic state, the body depletes glycogen, leading to significant water loss, which accounts for the rapid weight change in the 'induction' phase."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client following a strict plant-based diet for weight loss reports fatigue and 'brain fog.' Which nutrient deficiency should a coach screen for first, given it is virtually absent in unfortified plant foods?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Omega-6 Fatty Acids",
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria and is only naturally found in animal products. Deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms, making supplementation mandatory for long-term plant-based dieters."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "The PREDIMED study, a landmark trial for the Mediterranean protocol, demonstrated that a diet rich in healthy fats (EVOO and nuts) resulted in a 30% reduction in what specific outcome compared to a low-fat control group?",
            "options": [
                "Total body weight",
                "Major cardiovascular events",
                "Type 2 Diabetes incidence",
                "Muscle mass retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PREDIMED study (n=7,447) found that the Mediterranean diet significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, or CV death) by 30%, highlighting its role in health-span beyond simple weight loss."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When conducting a 4-week Elimination Diet to identify food sensitivities, what is the 'Gold Standard' procedure for confirming a specific food trigger?",
            "options": [
                "IgG blood testing immediately after the elimination phase",
                "Hair follicle analysis for mineral imbalances",
                "The Systematic Reintroduction/Oral Food Challenge",
                "Maintaining the elimination phase indefinitely to prevent symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While blood tests are often unreliable for sensitivities, the Systematic Reintroduction (introducing one food group every 3 days while monitoring symptoms) is the clinical gold standard for identifying triggers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the MATADOR study (2017), how did a 2-week 'Diet Break' compare to continuous energy restriction over the course of the intervention?",
            "options": [
                "It resulted in significant muscle loss due to inactivity",
                "It resulted in greater weight and fat loss and reduced the impact of adaptive thermogenesis",
                "It led to immediate fat regain that negated the previous deficit",
                "There was no measurable difference between the two groups"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MATADOR (Minimising Adaptive Thermogenesis And Deactivating Obesity Rebound) study showed that intermittent 2-week diet breaks led to greater weight loss and better maintenance of resting energy expenditure compared to continuous dieting."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the 'Exit Strategy' suggests that when transitioning to maintenance, calories should be increased gradually. What is the primary hormonal goal of this 'Reverse Dieting' approach?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress insulin production entirely",
                "To acutely spike cortisol to promote alertness",
                "To restore circulating leptin levels and thyroid hormone (T3) activity",
                "To decrease the thermic effect of food (TEF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of a controlled transition is to upregulate metabolic rate by restoring leptin and T3 levels, which typically drop during a prolonged caloric deficit, thereby minimizing fat overshoot during maintenance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Physiologically, why does alcohol consumption significantly stall fat loss even if the client remains in a caloric deficit?",
            "options": [
                "Alcohol is converted directly into adipose tissue with 95% efficiency",
                "Alcohol increases the metabolic rate so much that the body enters 'starvation mode'",
                "The body prioritizes the metabolism of acetate (from ethanol), suppressing whole-body lipid oxidation by up to 73%",
                "Alcohol stimulates the production of glucagon, which prevents fat burning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alcohol is a metabolic priority because acetate is toxic. While the body processes acetate, it effectively 'shuts off' the oxidation of fatty acids, meaning any dietary fat consumed alongside alcohol is more likely to be stored."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A food label claims '0g Trans Fat' per serving. However, the ingredients list includes 'partially hydrogenated soybean oil.' According to FDA labeling loopholes, what is the maximum amount of trans fat that could actually be in each serving?",
            "options": [
                "Exactly 0 grams",
                "0.49 grams",
                "1.0 gram",
                "2.5 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under current FDA regulations, if a product contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, the manufacturer is permitted to round down to 0g on the Nutrition Facts panel."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "To maximize the hormonal benefits of a 48-hour 'Refeed' (Lesson 5), which macronutrient should be the primary focus of the caloric increase?",
            "options": [
                "Fats, to provide a dense energy source for the brain",
                "Protein, to maximize muscle protein synthesis",
                "Carbohydrates, as they have the most significant impact on leptin signaling",
                "Alcohol, to provide a temporary metabolic 'shock'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Carbohydrates are the most effective macronutrient for increasing leptin levels and stimulating the conversion of T4 to the active T3 thyroid hormone, making them the ideal focus for a refeed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client has reached their goal weight and is moving into maintenance. According to data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), which behavior is most strongly associated with long-term weight loss maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates permanently",
                "High levels of physical activity (averaging ~60 minutes per day)",
                "Using 'detox' teas once per month",
                "Consuming a 'cheat meal' of over 3,000 calories once per week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NWCR, which tracks individuals who have maintained at least a 30lb weight loss for over a year, found that high levels of physical activity (approx. 2,500-3,000 kcal/week) is one of the most consistent predictors of success."
