            "question": "During Advanced Metabolic Testing (L1), a client's Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) is measured at 0.72 via indirect calorimetry. What does this primarily indicate about their substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates.",
                "The client is in a state of high metabolic flexibility.",
                "The client is almost exclusively oxidizing fatty acids.",
                "The client is experiencing severe anaerobic stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 to 0.72 indicates that fat is the primary fuel source being oxidized, whereas an RER of 1.0 would indicate pure carbohydrate oxidation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and interfere with leptin signaling (specifically the JAK2/STAT3 pathway), leading to leptin resistance and increased hunger."

                "Settling Point suggests weight is fixed by biology; Set Point suggests weight is determined by willpower.",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms in metabolic science."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Settling Point Theory accounts for the interaction between an individual's biology and their environment/habits, explaining why weight can be maintained at different levels over time."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The TRANSFORM Method™ emphasizes using metabolic data to identify the 'Metabolic Gap'—the difference between where a client's metabolism should be vs. where it is currently functioning."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the coach's urge to fix things; Motivational Interviewing teaches coaches to resist this and instead evoke the client's own motivations for change."
