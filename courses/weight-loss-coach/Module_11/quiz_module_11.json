            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "When conducting Advanced Metabolic Testing, which measurement represents the energy required for basic physiological functions (heartbeat, respiration) under strict conditions: post-absorptive state, lying down, and in a thermoneutral environment?",
            "options": [
                "Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)",
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)",
                "Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)",
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BMR is the most restrictive measurement of energy expenditure, requiring the client to be in a post-absorptive state and having slept in the testing facility, whereas RMR is measured under less stringent conditions."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of habit reset, which area of the brain acts as the 'habit center,' where behaviors become automated routines that require little conscious effort?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Basal Ganglia",

                "Anterior Cingulate Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia, specifically the striatum, is responsible for the formation and execution of habits, allowing the Prefrontal Cortex to focus on more complex, conscious tasks."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Anti-Inflammatory Protocols, which serum biomarker is most indicative of low-grade systemic chronic inflammation (LGCI) associated with adipose tissue dysfunction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is the gold standard for measuring systemic inflammation; levels between 1-3 mg/L often indicate moderate systemic inflammation common in metabolic dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Research on 'Maintenance Mastery' indicates that metabolic adaptation (adaptive thermogenesis) can cause a client's TDEE to be significantly lower than predicted. What is the typical percentage range of this 'metabolic gap' found in weight-reduced individuals?",
            "options": [
                "2-5% lower",
                "10-15% lower",
                "25-30% lower",
                "40-50% lower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those on 'The Biggest Loser' contestants and controlled clinical trials, show that metabolic adaptation often results in an energy expenditure 10-15% lower than predicted by body mass alone."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When using the TRANSFORM Method™ for Case Conceptualization, what is the first priority when a client presents with both significant metabolic resistance and high psychological stress?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the TRANSFORM Method™, physiological safety is paramount. High cortisol can mask progress and worsen metabolic resistance, making nervous system regulation the priority."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'weight loss plateau' where the scale hasn't moved for 3 weeks, but their clothes fit better and DEXA shows increased lean mass. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Metabolic Damage",

                "Leptin Resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Body recomposition occurs when a client loses fat and gains muscle simultaneously, which can cause the scale weight to remain stagnant despite improvements in body composition."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In Advanced Motivational Interviewing (MI), which of the following is an example of 'Eliciting Change Talk'?",

                "Telling the client exactly why they need to lose weight",
                "Asking: 'On a scale of 0-10, how important is it for you to make this change?'",
                "Correcting the client when they make a false statement about nutrition",
                "Providing a detailed meal plan without client input"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Importance Ruler' (0-10 scale) is a classic MI tool used to elicit the client's own motivations and 'change talk' rather than the coach imposing their own reasons."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hybrid models allow coaches to deliver core education via digital assets while using group sessions for high-level coaching, significantly increasing the number of clients served without a linear increase in hours worked."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio (common in Western diets) promotes inflammation. Reducing this ratio is a cornerstone of anti-inflammatory fat loss protocols."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "During the 'Maintenance Mastery' phase, what is the recommended 'Stability Buffer' for a client's weight to account for normal glycogen and water fluctuations?",
            "options": [
                "No more than 1 lb",
                "+/- 3 to 5 lbs",
                "+/- 8 to 10 lbs",
                "Weight should never fluctuate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 3-5 lb buffer is considered normal and healthy for weight stability, allowing for fluctuations in hydration, glycogen storage, and inflammation without triggering a 'relapse' mindset."
