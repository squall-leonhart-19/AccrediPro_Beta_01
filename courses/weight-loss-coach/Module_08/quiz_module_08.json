            "question": "According to the 'Identity vs. Action' framework in Lesson 1, what is the primary reason most weight loss efforts fail long-term?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of willpower to maintain a calorie deficit",
                "Focusing on outcome-based goals rather than identity-based habits",
                "Choosing the wrong macronutrient ratio for their body type",
                "Failing to track daily steps and water intake accurately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Outcome-based goals focus on what you want to achieve, whereas identity-based habits focus on who you wish to become. Lasting change occurs when the behavior becomes part of the client's self-identity."

            "question": "When helping a client reframe a limiting belief like 'I have a slow metabolism,' which cognitive technique is most effective for uncovering the core belief?",
            "options": [
                "The Downward Arrow Technique",
                "Positive Affirmations",
                "The Substitution Method",
                "Progressive Muscle Relaxation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Downward Arrow Technique involves asking 'If that were true, what would it mean about you?' to peel back layers of surface-level excuses and reach the core limiting belief."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity (Lesson 3), what does 'Hebb's Law' imply for a client trying to break a late-night snacking habit?",
            "options": [
                "The brain cannot create new pathways after age 25",
                "Neurons that fire together, wire together; repeating the habit strengthens the neural circuit",
                "Habits are stored in the prefrontal cortex and cannot be moved",
                "Weight loss is 100% determined by genetic 'hard-wiring'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hebb's Law states that 'neurons that fire together, wire together.' Every time a client repeats a habit, the synaptic connection strengthens, making the behavior more automatic."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client experiences an 'all-or-nothing' thought after eating a single cookie. Which component of the Cognitive Behavioral 'ABC' Model represents their belief that the whole day is ruined?",

                "B (Belief)",

                "D (Disruption)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the ABC model, 'A' is the event (eating the cookie), 'B' is the belief or interpretation of that event (the day is ruined), and 'C' is the emotional or behavioral consequence (binge eating)."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the 'Mind-Body Link.' How does chronic stress specifically contribute to visceral fat accumulation?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation increases the activity of 11β-HSD1, an enzyme that converts inactive cortisone back into active cortisol within fat cells, specifically promoting visceral (abdominal) fat storage."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "According to Kristin Neff’s research on self-compassion (Lesson 6), what effect does self-kindness have on weight loss motivation compared to self-criticism?",
            "options": [
                "Self-criticism is more effective for long-term discipline",
                "Self-compassion leads to 'laziness' and lower standards",
                "Self-compassion increases 'resilience' and the ability to bounce back from setbacks",
                "There is no measurable difference between the two approaches"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that self-compassion fosters emotional resilience, reducing the 'what the hell' effect and making clients more likely to return to their goals after a lapse."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "A client is frustrated because they lost 10lbs instead of their 15lb goal. If they are in 'The Gap' (Lesson 7), where is their focus directed?",

                "On the new habits they have successfully integrated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Being in 'The Gap' means measuring yourself against an unreachable ideal or future goal, which leads to dissatisfaction. Being in 'The Gain' means measuring backward from where you started."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Which strategy is recommended in Lesson 8 to transition a client from a 'Weight Loss Mindset' to a 'Maintenance Mindset'?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately stopping all tracking and monitoring",
                "Switching focus from 'weight subtraction' to 'capability addition' (e.g., strength goals)",
                "Increasing calorie intake by 1,000 calories per day instantly",
                "Setting a new, even more aggressive weight loss goal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Successful maintenance often requires shifting the focus from what is being lost (weight) to what is being gained (physical capability, energy, or strength) to maintain motivation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "NWCR data shows that high levels of physical activity (averaging 60-90 minutes daily) is one of the most consistent traits of successful long-term weight loss maintainers."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A client uses the 'STOP' technique (Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed) before eating a snack. This is an example of using which cognitive tool?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The STOP technique is a mindfulness-based tool used for 'Mindful Interception,' creating a space between a stimulus (hunger/emotion) and the response (eating) to allow for a conscious choice."
