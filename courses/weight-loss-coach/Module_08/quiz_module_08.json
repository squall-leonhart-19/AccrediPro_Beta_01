            "question": "During the initial health screening (Lesson 1), a client completes the PAR-Q+. If they answer 'Yes' to any of the seven questions, what is the mandatory next step for a Weight Loss Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with a low-intensity workout program immediately",
                "Advise the client to consult their physician before becoming more physically active",
                "Ignore the result if the client looks healthy and fit",
                "Perform a body composition analysis to assess risk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PAR-Q+ is designed to identify individuals for whom certain forms of physical activity may be contraindicated. A 'Yes' response to any question requires medical clearance before proceeding with exercise recommendations."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a common tool for body composition. According to Lesson 2, which factor is most likely to cause a significant 'false' decrease in body fat percentage readings in a single day?",
            "options": [
                "Eating a high-protein meal",
                "Acute dehydration",
                "Hyperhydration (excessive water intake)",
                "Performing heavy resistance training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BIA measures the resistance of electrical flow through the body. Since water conducts electricity well, hyperhydration reduces resistance, which the device often interprets as a higher lean mass and lower body fat percentage."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, we discuss blood biomarkers. A Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) level in which range is clinically defined as 'Prediabetes'?",
            "options": [
                "70 - 99 mg/dL",
                "100 - 125 mg/dL",
                "126 - 150 mg/dL",
                "Over 200 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines define the prediabetic range for fasting glucose as 100 to 125 mg/dL. Values of 126 mg/dL or higher on two separate tests indicate diabetes."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights the impact of sleep on weight loss. Research shows that just 2-3 nights of sleep deprivation (approx. 4 hours/night) can lead to which hormonal profile?",
            "options": [
                "Increased Leptin and decreased Ghrelin",
                "Decreased Cortisol and increased Growth Hormone",
                "Decreased Leptin and increased Ghrelin",
                "No significant change in metabolic hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep restriction significantly disrupts appetite regulation, leading to a decrease in leptin (the satiety hormone) and an increase in ghrelin (the hunger hormone), often resulting in a caloric surplus."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Process-Oriented' goal as defined in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Lose 10 pounds in 30 days",
                "Reduce body fat percentage to 15% by June",

                "Fit into a size 32 pair of jeans"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Process goals focus on the behaviors and actions the client controls (e.g., frequency of exercise), whereas outcome goals focus on the final result (e.g., weight or body fat percentage)."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client presents with rapid, unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, and a 'fruity' breath odor. According to Lesson 6, what is the correct professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Increase their caloric intake and prescribe more rest",
                "Immediate referral to a physician or emergency care due to potential Ketoacidosis",
                "Wait two weeks to see if symptoms resolve with better hydration",
                "Suggest a high-dose multivitamin to combat the fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These are red flags for Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) or undiagnosed Type 1 Diabetes, which are medical emergencies and outside the scope of coaching."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "When using wearable technology (Lesson 7), a consistently low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading compared to the client's baseline most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client is becoming more aerobically fit",
                "The client's Parasympathetic nervous system is dominant",
                "The client is under-recovered or experiencing high systemic stress",
                "The wearable device needs to be recalibrated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is a marker of Autonomic Nervous System balance. A low HRV (low variation between beats) indicates Sympathetic dominance, often caused by overtraining, lack of sleep, or high psychological stress."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, the 'Transformation Roadmap' should include 'Pivot Points.' What is a Pivot Point?",
            "options": [
                "The day the client signs the contract",
                "A scheduled review of data to determine if the current strategy needs adjustment",
                "A mandatory 'cheat day' every 14 days",
                "The point where the client stops losing weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pivot Points are pre-determined milestones where the coach and client analyze progress data to decide whether to continue the current path or modify the intervention (e.g., adjusting calories or volume)."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which body composition assessment method is considered a 'Four-Compartment Model' and has the lowest Standard Error of Estimate (SEE) at approximately ±1-2%?",
            "options": [
                "Skinfold Calipers",
                "Air Displacement Plethysmography (BodPod)",
                "Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)",
                "Visual Estimation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DXA is widely considered a gold standard in clinical settings because it measures bone mineral density, lean mass, and fat mass with high precision and a very low error rate compared to field methods."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A client's blood panel shows a Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio of 4.5. Based on the data analysis guidelines in Lesson 3, what does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Excellent cardiovascular health",
                "Optimal insulin sensitivity",
                "Significant risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome",
                "The client is consuming too much dietary fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio greater than 3.0 is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance and increased cardiovascular risk. An ideal ratio is typically 2.0 or lower."
