            "question": "According to the 'Identity vs. Action' framework, why do many clients experience the 'yo-yo' effect after reaching a weight goal?",
            "options": [
                "They lacked a sufficiently high caloric deficit during the active phase",
                "They changed their behaviors but never updated their underlying self-identity",
                "Metabolic adaptation makes it impossible to maintain weight loss for more than 6 months",
                "They focused too much on intrinsic motivation rather than external rewards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits (James Clear/Atomic Habits) suggest that if a person views themselves as 'a dieter' rather than 'a healthy person,' they will eventually revert to their old identity once the external goal is met."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Hebb's Law ('Neurons that fire together, wire together') explains that neuroplasticity is driven by which primary factor?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity cardiovascular exercise",
                "Consistent repetition of a thought or behavior",
                "Complete avoidance of all previous triggers",
                "Genetic predisposition to dopamine sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself. Hebb's Law states that repeated activation of specific neural pathways strengthens the synaptic connections, making that behavior more automatic over time."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client loses 12 pounds in 2 months but feels like a failure because they are still 30 pounds away from their 'ideal' weight. Which mindset trap are they currently in?",
            "options": [
                "The Gain",
                "The Gap",
                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "The Plateau Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' is the space between where you are and where you want to be. Measuring against an'ideal' (The Gap) leads to frustration, whereas measuring backward from where you started (The Gain) builds confidence and momentum."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the 'ABC Model' is used to deconstruct emotional eating. What does the 'B' stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Behavior (the act of eating)",
                "Biological Drive (hunger hormones)",
                "Beliefs (the interpretation of the event)",
                "Binge-triggering foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the ABC model, A is the Activating Event, B is the Belief (the internal narrative/interpretation), and C is the Consequence (the emotion or behavior that follows)."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course indicates that chronic stress increases visceral adiposity primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing the thermic effect of food (TEF)",
                "Upregulating lipoprotein lipase in abdominal fat cells via cortisol",

                "Inducing a permanent state of ketosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol promotes the storage of visceral (deep abdominal) fat by increasing the activity of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that facilitates fat storage, specifically in the trunk region."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which cognitive distortion is most likely present when a client says, 'I ate one cookie, so my whole week of dieting is ruined; I might as well eat the whole box'?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Reasoning",
                "Overgeneralization",
                "Dichotomous (All-or-Nothing) Thinking",
                "Personalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dichotomous thinking views situations in only two categories: perfect or failure. This distortion is a primary driver of the 'What the Hell' effect in dieting."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Research by Dr. Kristin Neff shows that self-compassion is a stronger predictor of health behavior adherence than self-criticism. Why?",
            "options": [
                "Self-compassion increases cortisol, which improves focus",
                "Self-criticism triggers the 'fight or flight' response, leading to emotional eating for safety",
                "Self-compassion removes the need for any caloric restriction",
                "Self-criticism is only effective for people with a high BMI"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-criticism activates the threat-defense system (cortisol/adrenaline), which often leads to 'comfort seeking' through food. Self-compassion activates the care-giving system, reducing stress and allowing for better executive function."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "To facilitate 'Myelination' of a new healthy habit, such as meal prepping, what is the most effective coaching strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Change the routine every week to keep the brain 'guessing'",
                "Perform the habit sporadically to test the brain's memory",
                "Consistent, daily repetition in a stable context",
                "Focusing only on the negative consequences of not doing the habit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myelin is the fatty sheath that insulates neural pathways. It is thickened through consistent repetition, which increases the speed and efficiency of neural signals, making the habit 'automatic.'"

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "During the maintenance phase, how does a 'Growth Mindset' practitioner view a weight regain of 3 pounds?",
            "options": [
                "As evidence that they were never meant to be thin",
                "As a 'data point' to analyze and adjust current strategies",
                "As a sign that they need to switch to a more restrictive diet immediately",
                "As a moral failure that requires self-punishment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A growth mindset views setbacks as feedback or data points rather than fixed indictments of character or ability, allowing the individual to problem-solve and persist."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a practical 'Cognitive Reframing' technique for a client who says 'I HAVE to go to the gym'?",
            "options": [
                "Changing the language to 'I GET to move my body to feel energized'",
                "Telling the client they are being lazy and need more discipline",
                "Agreeing that the gym is a chore but necessary for health",
                "Suggesting they skip the gym and do more cardio instead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reframing 'have to' (external pressure/burden) to 'get to' (opportunity/gratitude) shifts the brain from a state of resistance to a state of autonomy and intrinsic motivation."
