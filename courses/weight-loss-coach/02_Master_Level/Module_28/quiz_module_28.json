            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These are 'Red Flag' clinical presentations of severe malnutrition and potential Anorexia Nervosa. Coaching is outside the scope of practice; immediate medical intervention is required to manage cardiovascular risk."

                "Only a score of 5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A score of 2 or more on the SCOFF questionnaire (Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food) indicates a high probability of an eating disorder and necessitates a referral to a clinical professional."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In severe metabolic adaptation, the body downregulates T3 (triiodothyronine) and reduces NEAT to conserve energy, leading to the 'plateau' or 'starvation' state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD clients often struggle with executive functions like planning, organizing, and impulse control, which can lead to 'decision paralysis' or dopamine-seeking through binge eating."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark ACE study found that individuals with 4 or more ACEs were twice as likely to struggle with obesity, highlighting the need for trauma-informed care (Lesson 5)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that without high protein intake and resistance training, GLP-1 users can lose significant lean mass, leading to sarcopenic obesity and metabolic slowing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches cannot prescribe fasts or medication. During a flare, the focus must shift to recovery and reducing systemic stress to support the client's medical management."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation or severe mental health crises are outside the scope of weight loss coaching and require immediate professional crisis intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "RED-S (a form of starvation syndrome) causes the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to low LH, estrogen, and testosterone levels."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent clients often have sensory aversions. Forcing 'trigger' textures can lead to meltdowns or food avoidance; working with 'safe' textures ensures nutritional consistency."
