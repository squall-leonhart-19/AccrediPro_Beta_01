            "question": "A client presents with a persistent resting heart rate below 45 bpm and reports frequent dizziness. According to Lesson 1 on High-Risk Clinical Presentations, what is the most appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust their macronutrient ratios to include more sodium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A resting heart rate below 45-50 bpm is a clinical red flag for cardiovascular instability, often seen in severe caloric restriction or eating disorders, requiring immediate medical clearance."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, what is the primary diagnostic differentiator between 'Disordered Eating' and a clinical 'Eating Disorder' like Bulimia Nervosa?",

                "The desire to lose weight for aesthetic reasons",
                "The frequency and severity of compensatory behaviors (e.g., twice weekly for 3 months)",
                "The specific types of food being restricted",
                "The client's age and gender"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While disordered eating involves problematic behaviors, clinical Eating Disorders are defined by specific DSM-5 criteria regarding the frequency, duration, and psychological impact of those behaviors."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Based on the Minnesota Starvation Experiment data (Lesson 3), what percentage of BMR reduction can occur during severe metabolic adaptation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Minnesota Starvation Experiment showed that BMR can drop by approximately 40% due to both the loss of metabolic tissue and 'adaptive thermogenesis' (metabolic slowing beyond what is predicted by weight loss)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains often struggle with delayed gratification. Gamification and frequent rewards help provide the dopamine hits necessary to sustain habit formation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows a strong dose-response relationship between trauma and obesity; an ACE score of 4+ correlates with a 2-fold increase in the risk of severe obesity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
