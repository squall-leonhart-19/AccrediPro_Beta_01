            "question": "In the TRANSFORM Method™ synthesis, which two pillars are primarily addressed when a client exhibits both systemic inflammation and chronic leptin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid (T) and Fuel (F)",
                "Reset (R) and Rewire (R)",
                "Anti-Inflammatory (A) and Nutritional Synergy (N)",
                "Symmetry (S) and Optimization (O)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'A' (Anti-Inflammatory) and 'N' (Nutritional Synergy) pillars specifically target the biochemical pathways of inflammation and the hormonal signaling of satiety (leptin/ghrelin)."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic-Hormonal Cross-Analysis (L2), how does chronic cortisol elevation specifically interfere with the 'F' (Fuel) pillar?",
            "options": [
                "It increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues",
                "It promotes gluconeogenesis and leads to ectopic fat storage despite a caloric deficit",
                "It inhibits the release of ghrelin, causing suppressed appetite",
                "It accelerates the conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol triggers gluconeogenesis (creating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) and promotes visceral fat storage, even if the client is eating at a deficit, complicating fuel utilization."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "The 'Reset & Rewire' (L3) protocol utilizes the concept of 'Neuroplasticity.' Which specific brain region is a Master Practitioner attempting to strengthen to override the limbic system's impulsive eating cues?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The dlPFC is responsible for executive function and cognitive control; strengthening this area helps clients manage cravings generated by the reward-seeking limbic system."

                "It increases postprandial insulin sensitivity by 12%",
                "It causes a 'phase-shift' that reduces glucose tolerance, particularly in the evening",
                "It has no measurable effect on glucose, only on sleep architecture",
                "It improves the thermic effect of food (TEF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian disruption (misalignment of the SCN) significantly impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, often making evening carbohydrate consumption more metabolically taxing."

            "question": "During a Multi-Pillar Diagnostic (L6), a client presents with a 'Weight Loss Plateau' despite 100% dietary compliance. If their basal body temperature is consistently below 97.2°F (36.2°C), which pillar should be investigated first?",

            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Rigid Restraint' and 'Flexible Control' in the Dynamic Maintenance (M) pillar?",
            "options": [
                "Rigid restraint is more effective for long-term health",
                "Flexible control allows for planned deviations, which reduces the 'all-or-nothing' effect",
                "Rigid restraint involves no calorie counting, while flexible control does",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same concept"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flexible control is a psychological strategy that prevents the 'what the hell' effect, where one slip leads to a total binge, a key factor in the Maintain Forever architecture."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A TSH of 8.5 indicates clinical hypothyroidism. Master Practitioners must recognize clinical red flags and refer to medical professionals to ensure client safety and professional integrity."
