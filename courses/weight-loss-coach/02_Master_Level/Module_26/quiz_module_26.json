            "options": [
                "To achieve the highest rate of fat loss through aggressive caloric restriction.",
                "To establish metabolic baselines and assess the client's current physiological starting point.",
                "To focus exclusively on hypertrophy and muscle tissue accrual.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase T is the foundational 'Transition & Testing' phase where coaches gather data on metabolic rate, hormonal status, and current habits to build a customized roadmap."

                "One full month every three months of dieting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that 1-2 week diet breaks at maintenance calories help mitigate adaptive thermogenesis and restore thyroid (T3) and leptin levels."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "Phase A (Anti-Inflammatory) emphasizes the reduction of systemic inflammation. Which biomarker reduction is most closely linked to improved insulin sensitivity during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",

                "To provide a psychological 'cheat' to improve long-term adherence.",
                "To temporarily increase leptin levels and signal metabolic 'safety' to the hypothalamus.",
                "To deplete glycogen stores to induce deeper levels of ketosis.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic refeeds in Phase F are designed to upregulate leptin and thyroid hormones, preventing the metabolic slowdown associated with prolonged deficits."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Strength Programming (Phase S) guidelines, why is resistance training prioritized over steady-state cardio for fat loss?",
            "options": [
                "It burns more calories per minute during the actual session.",
                "It creates a significant EPOC (Afterburn) effect that can elevate metabolic rate for up to 38 hours.",
                "It significantly lowers cortisol levels compared to walking.",
                "It is the only way to induce a caloric deficit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-intensity resistance training creates Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC), keeping the metabolic rate elevated long after the workout is finished."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 introduces 'Behavioral Architecture.' What is the 'Goldilocks Zone' of habit stacking?",

                "Adding 5 new habits simultaneously to create a 'shock' to the system.",
                "Pairing a new habit with an existing, well-established anchor routine.",
                "Only performing habits when the client feels highly motivated.",
                "Focusing on the most difficult habit first to build mental toughness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking (Phase O) works best when a new, small behavior is anchored to an existing routine, making the behavior nearly automatic."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "In Phase R (Cognitive Restructuring), how should a coach address a client's 'Dichotomous Thinking'?",
            "options": [
                "By enforcing stricter rules to ensure the client stays on the 'good' side of the diet.",
                "By reframing 'failures' as data points and moving toward a continuum-based mindset.",
                "By ignoring the behavior and focusing strictly on the physical protocols.",
                "By prescribing extra cardio as a 'penalty' for off-plan eating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase R focuses on shifting away from 'all-or-nothing' (dichotomous) thinking, which is a primary predictor of weight regain and binge cycles."

            "options": [
                "To return to the client's original pre-diet eating habits immediately.",
                "To gradually increase calories to find the highest 'caloric floor' while maintaining weight.",
                "To transition the client into a permanent 500-calorie daily deficit.",
                "To eliminate all forms of tracking and monitoring once the goal weight is reached."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Maintenance Blueprint (Phase M) uses reverse dieting to increase the caloric floor, allowing the client to maintain their weight on the highest possible caloric intake."

                "Phase S: Increasing the intensity of her strength training.",
                "Phase F: Hormonal Optimization and stress management to lower cortisol.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When weight loss stalls despite a deficit and biofeedback (stress/sleep) is poor, Phase F is required to manage cortisol and restore hormonal balance."
