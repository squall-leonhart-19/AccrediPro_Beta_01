            "question": "To mitigate the risk of sarcopenic obesity during the menopausal transition, what is the recommended daily protein intake for active women?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "2.2 - 2.5 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that perimenopausal and postmenopausal women require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.6 g/kg) to maintain muscle protein synthesis and counteract the anabolic resistance caused by declining estrogen levels."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Twin Cycle Hypothesis' regarding Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) reversal, what must occur to restore normal insulin secretion?",
            "options": [
                "Complete elimination of dietary carbohydrates",
                "Reduction of ectopic fat in both the liver and the pancreas",
                "A minimum of 150 minutes of Zone 2 cardio per week",
                "Supplementation with high-dose Chromium Picolinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Twin Cycle Hypothesis, popularized by Prof. Roy Taylor, suggests that removing excess fat from the liver improves insulin response, while removing fat from the pancreas restores the first-phase insulin secretion of beta cells."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Which specific ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol has been clinically validated to improve metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients?",

                "10:1 ratio",
                "40:1 ratio",
                "100:1 ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown in multiple meta-analyses to be the most effective for restoring ovulation and reducing insulin resistance in PCOS."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Following Bariatric Surgery (specifically Roux-en-Y), which micronutrient deficiency is most common due to the bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Potassium",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 deficiency is highly prevalent post-bariatric surgery (affecting up to 50% of patients) because the procedure reduces gastric acid and intrinsic factor, both of which are required for B12 absorption."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In the context of high-performance athletes, what is the defining characteristic of 'Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S)?",
            "options": [
                "An absolute caloric intake below 1,200 kcal per day",

                "Consuming less than 3g of carbohydrates per kg of body weight",
                "Excessive protein intake leading to kidney strain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S occurs when an athlete's Energy Availability (EA) is too low (typically <30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass) to support optimal health, leading to impairments in metabolic rate, bone health, and immunity."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "For a client with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, why is 'aggressive' calorie restriction (e.g., <1,000 kcal/day) often counterproductive for weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of Reverse T3 (rT3), which blocks active T3 receptors",
                "It causes an immediate increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)",
                "It triggers an allergic reaction to dietary iodine",
                "It leads to the overproduction of thyroxine (T4)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Extreme caloric restriction signals the body to conserve energy, leading to increased conversion of T4 into Reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive isomer that competes with active T3, further slowing the basal metabolic rate."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Shift workers are at a 23% higher risk of obesity primarily due to 'Circadian Misalignment.' Which nutritional intervention is most effective for this population?",

                "Increasing caffeine intake to 600mg per shift",
                "Eliminating all fats from the diet during night shifts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aligning food intake with the natural circadian rhythm (eating during daylight/active hours) helps maintain insulin sensitivity, which is naturally lower during the biological night."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In pediatric weight management, the '5-2-1-0' rule is a standard clinical guideline. What does the '1' represent in this framework?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-2-1-0 rule stands for: 5 servings of fruits/veg, 2 hours or less of screen time, 1 hour of physical activity, and 0 sugary drinks."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Which dietary pattern has shown the most significant evidence for reducing systemic inflammation and improving 'leaky gut' symptoms in Hashimoto's patients?",
            "options": [
                "High-Carbohydrate, Low-Fat (HCLF)",

                "The Ketogenic Diet with high dairy intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AIP and Modified Mediterranean diets focus on removing inflammatory triggers (like gluten and processed soy) and increasing phytonutrients, which helps reduce the antibody load in autoimmune thyroiditis."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A client 18 months post-bariatric surgery presents with 'Dumping Syndrome' after eating. What is the most appropriate coaching recommendation?",

                "Consume high-sugar liquids to quickly raise blood glucose",
                "Separate liquid and solid intake by 30 minutes and reduce simple carbohydrate consumption",
                "Switch to a 100% liquid diet for 48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dumping syndrome is caused by rapid gastric emptying. Separating liquids from solids and avoiding high-osmolar (sugary) foods prevents the rapid influx of contents into the small intestine."
