            "question": "During the menopausal transition, what is the primary hormonal driver for the shift from gynoid (pear-shaped) to android (apple-shaped) fat distribution?",
            "options": [
                "The decline in 17β-estradiol levels",
                "A significant increase in progesterone",
                "The suppression of cortisol production",
                "An increase in Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The decline in estradiol during menopause leads to a reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity in gluteofemoral fat and an increase in androgenicity, promoting visceral fat accumulation."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding Type 2 Diabetes management suggests that 'Exercise Snacking' can significantly improve glycemic control. What is the most effective timing for these brief bouts?",
            "options": [
                "60 minutes before the first meal of the day",
                "Post-prandially, typically 15–30 minutes after eating",

                "Only during the fasted state to maximize fat oxidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-prandial movement (exercise snacking) utilizes GLUT4 translocation to clear blood glucose into the muscles, reducing the insulin demand of the meal."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In clients diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), what is the estimated prevalence of underlying insulin resistance, regardless of their BMI?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 70-80% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance, which serves as a primary driver for both metabolic and reproductive symptoms."

                "More than 3.0g per kg of ideal body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher protein intake (1.2-1.5g/kg) is critical post-bariatric surgery to preserve muscle mass during the rapid weight loss phase and support long-term metabolic rate."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) occurs when Energy Availability (EA) drops below a specific threshold. What is the recognized clinical threshold where physiological function begins to impair?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An energy availability of less than 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is associated with disruptions in luteinizing hormone pulsatility and metabolic rate suppression."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Why is extreme caloric restriction (e.g., >25% deficit) often contraindicated for clients with Hashimoto’s or subclinical hypothyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an overproduction of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)",
                "It suppresses the peripheral conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone",
                "It leads to immediate iodine toxicity in the thyroid gland",
                "It prevents the liver from detoxifying thyroid medications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Severe calorie restriction increases 'Reverse T3' (an inactive isomer) and decreases the conversion of T4 to the active T3, further slowing the basal metabolic rate."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Shift workers often experience 'Nighttime Glucose Intolerance.' Which physiological mechanism primarily explains this circadian disruption?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin secretion at night inhibits insulin release from the pancreas",
                "Cortisol levels are naturally at their highest point at 2:00 AM",
                "Leptin levels increase during the night shift, causing hunger suppression",
                "The core body temperature rises significantly during the night shift"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors are present on pancreatic beta cells; when melatonin is high (at night), it inhibits insulin secretion, making the body less capable of handling glucose during night shifts."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "When applying the '5-2-1-0' rule in pediatric weight management, what does the '2' represent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 5-2-1-0 framework stands for: 5 servings of fruit/veg, 2 hours or less of screen time, 1 hour of physical activity, and 0 sugary drinks."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Sarah, a 32-year-old client with PCOS and insulin resistance, is struggling with weight loss. What is the primary benefit of a Low-Glycemic Load (GL) diet for her specifically?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for any aerobic exercise",
                "It reduces postprandial insulin spikes, which helps lower ovarian androgen production",
                "It increases systemic inflammation to stimulate the immune system",
                "It forces the body into a state of permanent ketosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia stimulates the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens; lowering insulin through a low-GL diet directly addresses this hormonal driver."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "In the context of adolescent weight management, which approach is most likely to prevent the development of disordered eating behaviors?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that weight-neutral, behavior-focused approaches in adolescents reduce the risk of eating disorders while still improving metabolic health markers."
