            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "During an Indirect Calorimetry test, a client exhibits a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.71. What does this specifically indicate about their metabolic substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates for fuel.",
                "The client is in a state of nearly 100% lipid (fat) oxidation.",
                "The client is experiencing severe metabolic acidosis.",
                "The client has achieved a perfect balance of protein and glucose metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.70-0.72 indicates that the body is almost exclusively using fatty acids for fuel. An RQ of 1.0 would indicate pure carbohydrate oxidation, while 0.85 represents a mixed fuel source."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the neurological principles of 'Dopamine Loops,' what happens when a client encounters a 'Negative Reward Prediction Error'?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine levels spike, reinforcing the habit further.",
                "Dopamine levels remain stable, but serotonin increases to compensate.",
                "Dopamine levels drop below the previous baseline, leading to feelings of frustration or craving.",
                "The prefrontal cortex immediately overrides the basal ganglia to stop the craving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A negative reward prediction error occurs when an expected reward (e.g., the taste of a specific food) is missing or underwhelming, causing dopamine to drop below baseline, which often triggers intensified cravings or 'seeking' behavior."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In advanced micronutrition, which Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio is considered the 'gold standard' for minimizing systemic inflammation and optimizing metabolic signaling?",
            "options": [
                "20:1",
                "15:1",
                "1:1 to 4:1",
                "10:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet often reaches 15:1 or 20:1, clinical evidence suggests that a ratio of 4:1 or lower (ideally closer to 1:1) is necessary to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "The 'Set-Point Theory' suggests that the hypothalamus adjusts metabolic rate and hunger signals primarily in response to which hormone's concentration in the blood?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin",
                "Glucagon",
                "Melatonin",
                "Adrenaline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Leptin, produced by adipose tissue, acts as a 'thermostat' for the hypothalamus. When fat stores drop, leptin levels fall, signaling the brain to reduce metabolic rate and increase hunger to return to the 'set-point' weight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client has lost 10% of their body weight, but their Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) has dropped by 25%. This discrepancy, which exceeds the predicted drop from weight loss alone, is known as:",
            "options": [
                "The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Adaptive Thermogenesis",
                "Hyperplasia",
                "The Somogyi Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Thermogenesis (or metabolic adaptation) refers to the body's protective mechanism where it reduces energy expenditure beyond what is expected based on the loss of body mass (muscle and fat)."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Metabolic Flexibility is defined as the body's ability to transition efficiently between which two fuel sources?",
            "options": [
                "Protein and Alcohol",
                "Exogenous Glucose and Endogenous Glycogen",
                "Fatty Acids and Glucose",
                "Ketones and Lactate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the capacity to switch substrate oxidation (fat vs. carbs) in response to fuel availability and intensity of activity. Inflexible individuals often struggle to burn fat even in a fasted state."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroendocrinology (PNE), chronic hypercortisolemia (elevated cortisol) is known to specifically impair weight loss by:",

                "Increasing the conversion of T4 to active T3",

                "Enhancing the sensitivity of leptin receptors in the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels interfere with thyroid function by suppressing the conversion of the inactive T4 hormone into the active T3 hormone, effectively slowing down the metabolic rate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "During the 'TRANSFORM' Roadmap, if a client hits a true metabolic plateau for more than 3 weeks despite high adherence, what is the recommended 'Troubleshooting' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A 48-hour water fast to 'shock' the system",
                "Increasing cardiovascular exercise by 60 minutes daily",
                "A 1-2 week 'Diet Break' at calculated maintenance calories",
                "Reducing daily caloric intake by an additional 500 calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A structured 'Diet Break' at maintenance calories helps reverse the hormonal adaptations of dieting (increasing leptin and thyroid hormones), which can 'reset' the metabolism for further weight loss."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Which specific micronutrient is critical for the function of the 'Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase' (CPT) system, which transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Sodium",
                "Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Carnitine is the essential transport molecule that carries long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane so they can be burned for energy (beta-oxidation)."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "According to the module data, what is the 'Maintenance Gap'—the percentage of weight loss maintainers who typically require 10-15% fewer calories than 'never-obese' individuals of the same weight?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "There is no difference in caloric needs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to persistent metabolic adaptation, individuals who have lost significant weight often require 15-20% fewer calories to maintain that new weight compared to someone who was always at that weight."
