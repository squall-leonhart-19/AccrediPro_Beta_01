            "question": "During an Indirect Calorimetry test, a client exhibits a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.72. What does this specifically indicate about their metabolic substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is almost exclusively oxidizing carbohydrates for energy.",
                "The client is in a state of high metabolic flexibility, utilizing a 50/50 mix.",
                "The client is almost exclusively oxidizing fatty acids for energy.",
                "The client is experiencing severe metabolic acidosis and protein catabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 shows a very high reliance on fatty acids, typical of a fasted state or high metabolic efficiency in fat burning."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Habit Loop' and neurological rewiring concepts in Lesson 2, what is the primary role of the Basal Ganglia in weight management?",
            "options": [
                "Conscious decision-making regarding caloric intake.",
                "The storage and execution of automatic behaviors and routines.",
                "Regulating the body's core temperature and metabolic rate.",
                "Processing complex mathematical calculations for macro tracking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The basal ganglia are responsible for habit formation and the execution of 'chunks' of behavior, allowing the prefrontal cortex to focus on other tasks. Effective habit reset involves bypassing these automatic loops."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Anti-Inflammatory Diet (Lesson 3), which biomarker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for measuring systemic low-grade inflammation related to adiposity?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)",
                "ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)",
                "hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)",
                "LDL-P (LDL Particle Number)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is the primary clinical marker used to assess systemic inflammation, which is often elevated in individuals with excess visceral adipose tissue."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Set-Point Theory suggests that the body defends a specific weight range. Which hormone, secreted by adipose tissue, acts on the hypothalamus to signal energy sufficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Ghrelin",
                "Leptin",
                "Cholecystokinin (CCK)",
                "Glucagon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin is the 'satiety hormone' produced by fat cells. In Set-Point Theory, weight loss leads to a drop in leptin, which the hypothalamus interprets as starvation, triggering metabolic slowdown."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client has lost 15% of their body weight but has hit a 4-week plateau despite strict adherence. Research on 'Adaptive Thermogenesis' suggests their TDEE may have dropped by how much more than predicted by weight loss alone?",
            "options": [
                "0-5%",
                "Up to 15-20%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "There is no additional drop beyond weight-proportional changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis can cause a reduction in metabolic rate that is 15-20% greater than what would be predicted by the loss of body mass alone, primarily due to increased mitochondrial efficiency and reduced NEAT."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Metabolic Flexibility is the ability to switch between fuel sources. What mitochondrial co-activator is the primary driver of mitochondrial biogenesis and improved metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "PGC-1alpha",
                "mTOR",
                "Cortisol",
                "Insulin-like Growth Factor 1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PGC-1alpha is known as the 'master regulator' of mitochondrial biogenesis. Increasing its expression through exercise and specific nutritional strategies improves the body's ability to switch between fat and carb oxidation."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroendocrinology (Lesson 7), the HPA axis plays a critical role. Chronic elevation of which hormone is most closely linked to the accumulation of 'visceral' (deep abdominal) fat?",
            "options": [
                "Oxytocin",
                "Melatonin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Thyroxine (T4)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation (stress) promotes the deposition of visceral fat because abdominal fat cells have a higher density of glucocorticoid receptors compared to subcutaneous fat."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "The TRANSFORM Roadmap (Lesson 8) emphasizes 'Maintenance Forever.' What is the recommended frequency for 'Metabolic Priming' (diet breaks) to mitigate hormonal adaptation during a long-term fat loss phase?",
            "options": [
                "Never; diet breaks halt progress.",
                "Every 2 weeks for 2 weeks.",
                "Every 8-12 weeks for 1-2 weeks at maintenance calories.",
                "Only when the client reaches their final goal weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The TRANSFORM roadmap suggests strategic diet breaks every 8-12 weeks to restore leptin levels, reduce cortisol, and provide a psychological reprieve, which helps sustain long-term success."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Brain Fog,' fatigue, and an inability to lose weight despite a 1,200 calorie intake. Based on Lesson 6, which intervention would best support their Mitochondrial Health?",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing calories further to 800 per day.",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 7 days a week.",
                "Implementing Zone 2 cardio and increasing intake of CoQ10 and Alpha-Lipoic Acid rich foods.",
                "Eliminating all dietary fats to force the body to use stored fat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training increases mitochondrial density and efficiency. Combined with micronutrients like CoQ10 (essential for the electron transport chain), this addresses the root cause of metabolic inflexibility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Dopamine Loop' is discussed in relation to hyper-palatable foods. What happens to dopamine D2 receptors in the brain following chronic overconsumption of sugar and processed fats?",
            "options": [
                "They increase in number, making the person more sensitive to healthy foods.",
                "They are down-regulated (decreased), requiring more of the substance to achieve the same 'hit.'",
                "They disappear entirely, making it impossible to feel pleasure.",
                "They convert into serotonin receptors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic overstimulation of the reward system leads to the down-regulation of D2 receptors. This creates a 'tolerance' effect where the client needs more hyper-palatable food to feel satisfied, a key driver of obesity."
