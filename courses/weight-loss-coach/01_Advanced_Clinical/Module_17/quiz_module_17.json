            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client experiencing adaptive thermogenesis during a weight loss plateau typically shows a significant reduction in which component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)?",
            "options": [
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) only",
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)",
                "Exercise Energy Expenditure (EEE) exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that NEAT can drop by up to 500 calories per day during prolonged caloric restriction as the body subconsciously conserves energy, making it a primary driver of metabolic adaptation."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "For a client with PCOS and significant insulin resistance, what is the clinically recommended ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol to improve metabolic parameters and ovulatory function?",
            "options": [
                "10:1",
                "40:1",
                "100:1",
                "1:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown in multiple meta-analyses to be the most effective for improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "During the menopausal transition, why does fat distribution typically shift from subcutaneous (gynoid) to visceral (android) depots?",
            "options": [
                "Increased progesterone levels",
                "Decrease in circulating estrogen leading to reduced lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in the gluteofemoral region",
                "A sudden increase in growth hormone",
                "Decrease in total caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The decline in estrogen reduces the activity of LPL in the hips and thighs while increasing it in the abdominal region, leading to the characteristic shift toward visceral adiposity."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Clients using GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., Semaglutide) are at a higher risk for 'sarcopenic weight loss.' What is the recommended daily protein intake to mitigate lean body mass loss in these clients?",
            "options": [
                "0.8g per kg of body weight",
                "1.0g per kg of body weight",
                "1.5g to 2.0g per kg of body weight",
                "Protein intake should be restricted to prevent kidney strain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the rapid weight loss and suppressed appetite associated with GLP-1s, a higher protein intake (1.5-2.0g/kg) combined with resistance training is essential to preserve muscle tissue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A post-bariatric surgery client (Roux-en-Y) reports shakiness, sweating, and tachycardia 30 minutes after consuming a high-sugar smoothie. This is most likely:",
            "options": [
                "Late Dumping Syndrome",
                "Early Dumping Syndrome",
                "Reactive Hypoglycemia",
                "A panic attack"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early Dumping Syndrome occurs 10-30 minutes post-meal due to the rapid movement of hyperosmolar chyme into the small intestine, causing a fluid shift and vasomotor symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In clients with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, why is extreme caloric restriction (e.g., <1000 kcal) particularly counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of Reverse T3 (rT3), which blocks active T3 receptors",
                "It causes an immediate increase in TSH",
                "It triggers an allergic reaction to iodine",
                "It increases the absorption of levothyroxine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Severe restriction signals the body to conserve energy by converting T4 into the inactive 'Reverse T3' (rT3) instead of the active T3, further slowing the metabolic rate."

            "id": "q17_7",

            "options": [
                "The amount of food consumed during a binge",
                "The presence of a 'loss of control' feeling",
                "The absence of regular compensatory behaviors (purging, excessive exercise, fasting)",
                "The frequency of binge episodes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike Bulimia Nervosa, individuals with BED do not regularly engage in compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or laxative misuse after a binge episode."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a 70-year-old client with sarcopenic obesity, how much Leucine should be present in each bolus of protein?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 grams",
                "1.0 grams",
                "2.5 to 3.0 grams",
                "Leucine is not necessary for older adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Threshold' increases with age; older adults require roughly 2.5-3.0g of Leucine per meal to effectively trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client has lost 10% of their body weight and reached a plateau. Their leptin levels have dropped significantly. Which strategy is scientifically supported to temporarily boost leptin and thyroid output?",
            "options": [
                "A 24-hour water fast",
                "Eliminating all dietary fats for 3 days",
                "A controlled 48-hour 'refeed' involving a caloric surplus from carbohydrates",
                "Increasing cardiovascular exercise to 2 hours daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Controlled carbohydrate refeeds can temporarily increase leptin levels and sympathetic nervous system activity, helping to offset some metabolic adaptations."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Which micronutrient deficiency is most common and potentially dangerous for a client several years after a Gastric Bypass, often manifesting as neurological issues?",

                "Vitamin B12",
                "Vitamin K",
                "Sodium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 deficiency is highly prevalent post-bypass due to the lack of Intrinsic Factor and reduced stomach acid; if left untreated, it can cause irreversible nerve damage."
