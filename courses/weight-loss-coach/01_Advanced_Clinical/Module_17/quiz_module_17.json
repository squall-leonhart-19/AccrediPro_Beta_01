            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "According to research on adaptive thermogenesis, a client who has lost significant weight may experience a reduction in Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) that is how much lower than predicted by their new body mass?",
            "options": [
                "50-100 kcal/day",
                "300-500 kcal/day",
                "800-1000 kcal/day",
                "Exactly 15% of their BMR regardless of weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis, or metabolic adaptation, often results in a 'metabolic gap' of 300-500 kcal/day beyond what is expected from the loss of metabolically active tissue alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In clients with PCOS, what is the clinically recommended ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol used to improve insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance?",
            "options": [
                "1:1",
                "10:1",
                "40:1",
                "100:5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown in multiple studies to be the most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin resistance in PCOS patients."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "During the menopausal transition, the decline in estradiol leads to which physiological change that complicates weight management?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in subcutaneous fat on the lower body",
                "A shift toward visceral fat storage and increased cortisol sensitivity",
                "An automatic 50% reduction in protein requirements",
                "Improvement in insulin sensitivity due to lower estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The drop in estradiol during menopause causes a shift in fat distribution from the hips/thighs to the visceral (abdominal) cavity and increases the adipose tissue's sensitivity to cortisol."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Research on GLP-1 agonists (like Semaglutide) indicates that without intervention, lean body mass can account for what percentage of total weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Up to 40%",
                "Exactly 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that without high protein intake and resistance training, up to 40% of the weight lost on GLP-1 medications can come from lean muscle mass, significantly lowering the client's metabolic rate."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A post-bariatric surgery client experiences 'Late Dumping Syndrome' (Reactive Hypoglycemia). When does this typically occur and why?",
            "options": [
                "15 minutes after eating due to rapid gastric emptying",
                "2-3 hours after a high-carbohydrate meal due to an excessive insulin surge",
                "Only when fasting for more than 16 hours",
                "Immediately upon waking due to low glycogen stores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Late Dumping Syndrome occurs 2-3 hours post-meal when a rapid transit of sugar into the small intestine triggers an exaggerated insulin response, leading to a subsequent blood sugar crash."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is essential for the deiodinase enzymes responsible for converting T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) into T3 (active hormone)?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Selenium",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a mandatory cofactor for deiodinase enzymes; a deficiency can impair the conversion of T4 to the metabolically active T3, slowing the metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary diagnostic differentiator between Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Bulimia Nervosa?",
            "options": [
                "BED involves eating rapidly until uncomfortably full",
                "BED does not involve regular compensatory behaviors like purging or excessive exercise",
                "BED only occurs in individuals with a BMI over 30",
                "Bulimia does not involve feelings of guilt after an episode"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both involve binge episodes, BED is characterized by the absence of regular compensatory behaviors (purging, fasting, or over-exercising) that define Bulimia Nervosa."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a 70-year-old client with sarcopenic obesity, what is the recommended protein intake per meal to reach the 'leucine threshold'?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams",
                "20 grams",
                "35-40 grams (containing 2.5-3g Leucine)",
                "70 grams per meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Older adults require a higher bolus of protein (35-40g) per meal to overcome anabolic resistance and provide enough leucine (2.5-3g) to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "The MATADOR study (Minimizing Adaptive Thermogenesis and Deactivating Overly Radical Adaptation) demonstrated that which protocol was superior for fat loss?",
            "options": [
                "Continuous caloric restriction for 16 weeks",
                "Intermittent restriction (2 weeks of deficit followed by 2 weeks of maintenance)",
                "One day of fasting followed by one day of feasting",
                "Low-fat dieting with no breaks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MATADOR study showed that 2-week 'on' and 2-week 'off' (at maintenance) cycles resulted in significantly greater fat loss and less metabolic slowing than continuous restriction."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client with PCOS presents with Acanthosis Nigricans (darkened, velvety skin patches). This is a clinical 'red flag' for which underlying issue?",
            "options": [
                "Poor hygiene",
                "Severe insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia",
                "Excessive Vitamin A intake",
                "Hypocortisolism (Addison's Disease)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acanthosis Nigricans is a dermatological manifestation of systemic insulin resistance, where high levels of insulin spill over and activate IGF-1 receptors in the skin."
