            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to Herman Pontzer’s Constrained Energy Expenditure model (2016), why does increasing physical activity often fail to produce linear weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "The body increases basal metabolic rate to compensate for exercise",
                "The body adaptively reduces energy spent on other physiological processes to maintain a TDEE ceiling",
                "Exercise increases muscle mass so rapidly that weight remains stagnant",
                "The digestive system becomes 50% more efficient at absorbing calories during exercise blocks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pontzer's research suggests that TDEE is relatively stable; when physical activity increases, the body compensates by reducing energy spent on other functions like immune response and tissue repair."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity, which brain structure is primarily responsible for the transition of a behavior from a conscious effort to an automatic 'habit'?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia is the center for habit formation and automaticity, whereas the Prefrontal Cortex handles executive function and conscious decision-making."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis on the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) found that individuals with the highest DII scores (most pro-inflammatory) had what increased risk of obesity compared to the lowest scores?",
            "options": [
                "15% increased risk",
                "31% increased risk",
                "Over 100% increased risk",
                "No statistically significant difference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a roughly 31% higher risk of obesity for those consuming highly pro-inflammatory diets, as measured by the DII."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "The 'Protein Leverage Hypothesis' suggests that humans will continue to consume total calories until which specific requirement is met?",
            "options": [
                "A specific volume of food in the stomach",
                "A target threshold of dietary protein/amino acids",
                "A specific ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids",
                "The replenishment of hepatic glycogen stores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis posits that the drive for protein is so strong that we will overconsume fats and carbohydrates if the protein density of our diet is too low."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which myokine, released during skeletal muscle contraction, is scientifically recognized for its ability to induce the 'browning' of white adipose tissue?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Irisin is a myokine secreted during exercise that facilitates the conversion of white fat into energy-burning beige fat, improving metabolic health."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "During a state of chronic caloric deficit, what is the typical endocrine response regarding Leptin and Ghrelin?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin increases and Ghrelin decreases",
                "Both Leptin and Ghrelin decrease",
                "Leptin decreases and Ghrelin increases",
                "Both Leptin and Ghrelin increase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As fat cells shrink, Leptin (the satiety hormone) drops, and Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) rises, creating a biological drive to regain weight."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to chronobiology research, why is high-calorie intake late at night (close to melatonin onset) metabolically disruptive?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin enhances insulin sensitivity too much, causing hypoglycemia",
                "Melatonin receptors on the pancreas inhibit insulin secretion, leading to prolonged hyperglycemia",
                "The stomach stops producing hydrochloric acid after 8:00 PM",
                "Late-night calories are automatically diverted to visceral fat storage only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin signals the body to rest; it suppresses insulin secretion. Eating when melatonin is high results in poorer glucose clearance and higher metabolic strain."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a major inflammatory cytokine that links obesity to insulin resistance through the disruption of the insulin receptor substrate."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "In the 'Science of Maintenance,' which psychological shift is most predictive of long-term success according to registry data?",
            "options": [
                "Maintaining a strict 'dieting' mindset indefinitely",
                "A shift from extrinsic motivation to an intrinsic identity-based self-image",

                "Avoiding all social situations involving food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Successful maintainers usually transition from 'doing a diet' (extrinsic/outcome) to 'being a healthy person' (intrinsic/identity), which reduces the cognitive effort required for maintenance."
