            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to Herman Pontzer’s Constrained Total Energy Expenditure model, how does the body typically respond to long-term increases in physical activity levels?",
            "options": [
                "Total energy expenditure increases linearly and indefinitely with activity.",
                "The body compensates by reducing energy spent on other physiological processes, causing TDEE to plateau.",
                "Metabolic rate increases significantly to support the added movement, regardless of duration.",
                "The body increases basal metabolic rate (BMR) to match the higher activity levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pontzer's research suggests that TDEE is 'constrained'; the body compensates for high activity by reducing energy spent on other non-essential functions, meaning exercise alone often results in less weight loss than expected."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity, which structural change in the brain is associated with a behavior moving from a conscious 'goal-directed' action to an automatic habit?",
            "options": [
                "A shift in neural dominance from the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia.",
                "An increase in amygdala volume to enhance emotional response to food.",
                "The complete pruning of the hippocampus to forget old eating patterns.",
                "The thickening of the temporal lobe to improve taste perception."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Habit formation involves a shift from the prefrontal cortex (executive function/effort) to the basal ganglia (automaticity), specifically the sensorimotor striatum."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) found that individuals with the highest pro-inflammatory DII scores had what percentage increase in the risk of obesity?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 12%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 36%",
                "Approximately 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high DII scores (pro-inflammatory diets) are associated with a roughly 36% higher risk of obesity compared to anti-inflammatory diets."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis (PLH) suggests that the obesity epidemic is partly driven by 'protein dilution.' What does this mean for human consumption patterns?",
            "options": [
                "Humans stop eating as soon as they reach a specific calorie limit.",
                "Humans will overconsume fats and carbohydrates until a specific protein target is met.",
                "High protein intake triggers immediate fat storage through insulin spikes.",
                "Protein has no effect on satiety compared to complex carbohydrates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PLH posits that the body prioritizes protein intake; if the diet is low in protein percentage, individuals will eat more total energy to reach their absolute protein requirement."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Resistance training releases myokines like Irisin. What is the primary 'browning' effect of Irisin on adipose tissue?",
            "options": [
                "It converts white adipose tissue (WAT) into beige/brown adipose tissue (BAT), increasing thermogenesis.",
                "It causes white adipose tissue to store more triglycerides for later use.",
                "It hardens fat cells to make them resistant to lipolysis.",
                "It prevents the liver from processing fatty acids."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Irisin is a myokine that promotes the 'browning' of white fat, leading to increased mitochondrial density and higher energy expenditure through heat (thermogenesis)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In individuals with leptin resistance, why does the brain fail to signal the 'stop eating' command despite having high levels of body fat?",
            "options": [
                "The body stops producing leptin entirely.",
                "Inflammation at the hypothalamus disrupts leptin receptor signaling, making the brain think it is starving.",
                "Leptin is converted into ghrelin in the bloodstream.",
                "Insulin blocks the production of leptin in the adipocytes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin resistance occurs when the hypothalamus becomes 'deaf' to leptin signals, often due to inflammation, leading the brain to perceive a state of low energy availability."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to circadian rhythm research, why is 'Early Time-Restricted Feeding' (eTRF) often more effective for insulin sensitivity than late-night eating?",
            "options": [
                "The body is naturally more insulin sensitive in the morning and afternoon.",
                "Melatonin production at night enhances the body's ability to process glucose.",
                "Cortisol is lowest in the morning, preventing fat storage.",
                "Digestion stops completely after 6:00 PM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food (TEF) are higher in the morning/daylight hours, aligning with our biological clocks for optimal nutrient processing."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) shows that 78% of successful weight-loss maintainers perform which specific daily habit?",
            "options": [
                "Eating breakfast every day.",
                "Following a ketogenic diet strictly.",
                "Performing 2 hours of high-intensity interval training (HIIT).",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Registry data shows that 78% of successful maintainers eat breakfast daily, and 90% exercise, on average, about 1 hour per day."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "When adipose tissue becomes 'hypoxic' due to rapid hypertrophy (cell enlargement), what is the immediate immunological consequence?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of adiponectin to burn fat.",
                "Infiltration of M1 macrophages and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha.",
                "The tissue becomes more sensitive to insulin to compensate.",
                "The fat cells shrink instantly to allow for more oxygen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As fat cells grow too large, they outgrow their oxygen supply (hypoxia), triggering an inflammatory response where M1 macrophages infiltrate the tissue and secrete pro-inflammatory markers."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which concept is described as the 'Identity Shift' necessary for permanent weight maintenance according to the Science of Maintenance lessons?",

                "Maintaining a strict 'diet' mindset for life.",
                "Moving from extrinsic motivation (weight loss) to intrinsic identity (being an active, healthy person).",

                "Avoiding all social situations where food might be present."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term success is highly correlated with an identity shift where healthy behaviors become part of 'who the person is' rather than just 'what the person is doing' to lose weight."
