            "question": "In the TRANSFORM Protocol architecture, what is the primary objective of the 'A' (Assessment & Alignment) stage within Phase 1?",
            "options": [
                "To implement a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) regimen",
                "To establish bio-individual baselines and ensure the client's goals align with physiological capacity",
                "To begin aggressive caloric restriction of 50% below TDEE",
                "To prescribe specific pharmaceutical interventions for weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessment & Alignment is critical for establishing the client's starting point (biomarkers, body comp) and ensuring their expectations match the metabolic reality of their current health status."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "Phase 1: Metabolic Initiation (T, R, A) emphasizes a 'Reset' period. According to the protocol, what is the physiological rationale for a 14-21 day anti-inflammatory reset?",
            "options": [
                "To force the body into a state of permanent ketosis",
                "To deplete glycogen stores completely for the duration of the program",
                "To downregulate systemic inflammation and improve insulin receptor sensitivity",
                "To test the client's willpower before moving to Phase 2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Reset period is designed to reduce cellular inflammation and 'quiet' the hormonal noise (like hyperinsulinemia) that prevents lipolysis."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "During Phase 2: Hormonal & Nutrient Optimization (N, F), which micronutrient is specifically highlighted for its role in the peripheral conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a required cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 to the metabolically active T3 hormone, a key focus in nutrient optimization."

            "options": [
                "It increases the thermic effect of food (TEF) by 50%",
                "It increases Lean Body Mass (LBM), thereby raising the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)",
                "It suppresses ghrelin production for 48 hours post-exercise",
                "It eliminates the need for any dietary tracking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic strengthening focuses on hypertrophy and neuromuscular adaptation to increase the body's 'engine' size (BMR), making weight maintenance easier."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Reframing helps clients view setbacks as data points rather than moral failures, which is essential for long-term resilience."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "According to the Clinical Decision Tree for Non-Responders, if a client has lost 0 lbs in 3 weeks but has lost 1.5 inches off their waist, what is the correct classification?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Pseudo-Plateau occurs when weight is stable but body composition (inches/body fat %) is improving, indicating the protocol is working."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In the 'Transitioning to Sustainability' (M - Mastery) phase, what is the recommended approach to caloric intake?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse dieting allows the metabolism to adapt to higher caloric loads slowly, preventing the rapid fat storage often seen after aggressive dieting."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For high-cortisol clients, adding excessive exercise or extreme fasting can further stress the HPA-axis. Managing the stress response is the priority to unlock fat loss."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that 'Metabolic Breaks' (diet breaks) can reduce the drop in resting metabolic rate by what percentage compared to continuous restriction?",

                "5-10%",
                "15-25%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic diet breaks help mitigate 'Adaptive Thermogenesis' (metabolic adaptation) by 15-25%, making the protocol more effective over time."
