            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In Phase 2 (Hormonal & Nutrient Optimization), the 'F' stands for Functional. What does this stage prioritize regarding client interventions?",

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "The 'R' (Rewiring) in the Mindset phase utilizes neuroplasticity principles. Which technique is specifically recommended for 'extinguishing' a maladaptive food-reward pathway?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rewiring (R) focuses on neuroplasticity, using Cognitive Appraisal (changing how one views a stimulus) and Stimulus Control (modifying the environment) to break old neural pathways related to food reward."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In the Clinical Decision Tree for Non-Responders, if a client shows 100% dietary compliance but zero weight loss after 21 days, what is the first 'Hidden Stressor' to investigate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When compliance is high but progress is stalled, the decision tree directs the coach to investigate physiological 'blockers' such as thyroid issues, severe HPA axis dysfunction, or occult inflammation."

                "She requested more time to learn recipes",
                "Her estrogen-to-progesterone ratio required longer stabilization for fat oxidation to occur",
                "She failed to follow the exercise protocol in Phase 1",
                "The coach wanted to maximize the financial contract length"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In perimenopausal cases, hormonal fluctuations can significantly impact metabolic rate; extending the Optimization phase ensures that the hormonal environment is conducive to fat loss before moving to Metabolic Strengthening."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that Adaptive Thermogenesis can reduce TDEE by what percentage beyond what is predicted by weight loss alone?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Thermogenesis (metabolic adaptation) typically accounts for a 5-15% reduction in Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) beyond the loss of body mass, which the TRANSFORM protocol aims to mitigate."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between the 'R' (Rewiring) and the 'R' (Resilience) stages in the Psychological Integration phase?",
            "options": [
                "Rewiring is for weight loss; Resilience is for muscle gain",
                "Rewiring changes existing habits; Resilience builds the capacity to handle future stressors without relapse",
                "There is no difference; they are used interchangeably",
                "Rewiring is done by the coach; Resilience is done by a therapist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rewiring (R1) is about changing current neural patterns and habits, while Resilience (R2) is about 'future-proofing' the client by building the psychological grit and coping mechanisms needed for long-term maintenance."
