            "question": "During the menopausal transition, the shift from a 'pear-shaped' to an 'apple-shaped' fat distribution is primarily driven by which hormonal change?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in progesterone levels",
                "The decline in 17β-estradiol (E2)",
                "A sudden drop in cortisol production",
                "The stabilization of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The decline in estradiol during menopause leads to a redistribution of adipose tissue from subcutaneous (hips/thighs) to visceral (abdominal) depots, increasing metabolic risk."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of metabolic adaptation, what did 'The Biggest Loser' study (Fothergill et al., 2016) reveal about participants 6 years later?",
            "options": [
                "Their metabolisms had fully recovered to baseline levels",
                "Their Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) remained significantly suppressed despite weight regain",
                "They maintained a 50% increase in NEAT compared to baseline",
                "Their leptin levels were permanently elevated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that participants experienced persistent metabolic slowing (adaptive thermogenesis) that did not recover even after regaining most of the weight."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A high-stress corporate executive presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms and abdominal weight gain. Which physiological state is most likely contributing to their visceral adiposity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated evening cortisol disrupts the circadian rhythm and promotes visceral fat storage, particularly when coupled with poor sleep hygiene common in high-stress roles."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Which specific intervention has been shown in meta-analyses to be as effective as Metformin for improving insulin sensitivity and ovulation in PCOS patients?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inositol acts as a second messenger for insulin; the 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is evidence-based for improving metabolic and reproductive markers in PCOS."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "To combat 'anabolic resistance' in a 70-year-old client with sarcopenic obesity, what is the recommended daily protein intake?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging populations require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5g/kg) to trigger muscle protein synthesis due to decreased sensitivity to amino acids (anabolic resistance)."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Why is a 'caloric floor' (minimum intake) critical for clients with Hashimoto’s or Hypothyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "Extreme restriction increases the conversion of T4 to active T3",
                "Extreme restriction suppresses the conversion of T4 to active T3 and increases Reverse T3",
                "Hypothyroid clients need at least 3,000 calories to maintain muscle",
                "Thyroid medications only work when taken with a 1,000-calorie meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Severe caloric deficits signal the body to conserve energy by reducing the conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone, further slowing the metabolism."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In trauma-informed coaching, if a client becomes 'hyper-aroused' (anxious, racing heart) during a session, they have moved:",

                "Into a state of metabolic flexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal (fight/flight) occurs when a client is pushed above their 'Window of Tolerance,' making it difficult to process information or regulate eating behaviors."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "The 'Energy Gap' concept in weight loss maintenance suggests that a person who has lost 10% of their body weight may need to consume how much less than a never-obese person of the same weight?",

                "Approximately 50 kcal/day",
                "Approximately 100 kcal/day",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Energy Gap' refers to the persistent reduction in energy requirements (300-500 kcal) due to metabolic and behavioral adaptations following significant weight loss."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weight loss reduces leptin (satiety hormone) and increases ghrelin (hunger hormone), a state that can persist long-term and drive weight regain."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A client with PCOS and high insulin resistance is struggling with weight loss. Which exercise sequence is most recommended by current clinical guidelines?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance training increases GLUT4 translocation and muscle mass, which are primary sites for glucose disposal, making it essential for managing insulin resistance in PCOS."
