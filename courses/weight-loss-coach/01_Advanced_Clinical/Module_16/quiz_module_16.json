            "question": "In the context of the menopausal transition, what is the primary driver for the shift from gynoid (pear-shaped) to android (apple-shaped) fat distribution?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in the estrogen-to-androgen ratio",
                "An increase in progesterone production",
                "A decrease in total daily cortisol secretion",
                "The natural increase in growth hormone during aging"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As estrogen levels decline more sharply than testosterone during menopause, the resulting decrease in the estrogen-to-androgen ratio promotes visceral fat storage in the abdominal region."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "Research on metabolic adaptation in chronic 'yo-yo' dieters suggests that the 'metabolic gap' (the difference between predicted and actual RMR) can persist for how long after weight loss has ceased?",
            "options": [
                "It resolves within 2 weeks of eating at maintenance",
                "It usually resolves within 3 months",
                "It can persist for years, as seen in long-term follow-ups of 'The Biggest Loser' contestants",
                "It only occurs during the active weight loss phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that metabolic adaptation (adaptive thermogenesis) can persist for years, making long-term maintenance difficult for those with a history of extreme chronic dieting."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "For a high-stress corporate executive, why is 'blue light' exposure late at night specifically detrimental to weight loss efforts?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the thermic effect of food",
                "It suppresses melatonin and causes a phase-shift in the cortisol rhythm, leading to elevated evening insulin resistance",
                "It directly inhibits the thyroid gland from releasing T4",
                "It causes a 50% reduction in protein synthesis during sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light suppresses melatonin, which disrupts the circadian rhythm and can lead to elevated evening cortisol and insulin resistance, promoting fat storage."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "When managing a client with PCOS and Insulin Resistance, which nutritional strategy is emphasized in the 'Multi-Pillar Approach' to improve insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-carbohydrate breakfast to 'kickstart' the metabolism",
                "Eliminating all forms of dietary fat",
                "Carbohydrate partitioning, specifically matching higher carb intake to periods of high physical activity",
                "Eating 6-8 small meals per day to keep insulin levels constant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Carbohydrate partitioning (peri-workout nutrition) allows the body to utilize glucose more effectively through non-insulin dependent glucose uptake in the muscles."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the 'Sarcopenic Obesity' lesson, what is the recommended protein threshold per meal to overcome 'anabolic resistance' in the aging population?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams",
                "15-20 grams",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging individuals require a higher per-meal protein bolus (30-40g) to trigger muscle protein synthesis compared to younger individuals due to anabolic resistance."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "For clients with Hashimoto’s or Hypothyroidism, why are extremely low-calorie diets (e.g., <1000 kcal) contraindicated?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the conversion of T4 to active T3",
                "They can trigger an increase in Reverse T3 (rT3), which acts as a 'brake' on the metabolism",
                "They cause the thyroid gland to grow in size (goiter)",
                "They prevent the absorption of levothyroxine medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extreme caloric restriction signals the body to conserve energy, increasing the conversion of T4 into Reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive isomer that blocks T3 receptors and slows metabolism."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In a trauma-informed approach to emotional eating, what does the 'Window of Tolerance' represent?",
            "options": [
                "The 20-minute window after a meal where satiety signals are highest",
                "The zone where a person is able to process and integrate information without becoming hyper-aroused or hypo-aroused",
                "The maximum amount of calories a client can overeat before fat storage occurs",
                "The period of time a client can go without food before 'hangry' symptoms emerge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a term used in trauma-informed care to describe the optimal zone of arousal where a client can effectively use coping skills and regulate emotions."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Maintenance Forever' strategy, what is the statistical significance of the 1-2 year maintenance milestone?",
            "options": [
                "After 2 years, the body's set point completely resets to the new lower weight",
                "The risk of weight regain drops by nearly 50% if the new weight is maintained for at least one year",
                "Metabolism increases by 20% after one year of maintenance",
                "Ghrelin levels permanently drop to zero after two years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that if a client can maintain weight loss for 1-2 years, the physiological and behavioral patterns stabilize, significantly reducing the statistical probability of regain."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Which specific hormone is often referred to as the 'anti-starvation hormone' that drops significantly during chronic dieting, leading to increased hunger and decreased energy expenditure?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin",
                "Glucagon",
                "Adrenaline",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Leptin, produced by fat cells, signals the brain about energy availability. During dieting, leptin levels drop, which triggers the brain to increase hunger and decrease metabolic rate."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A 55-year-old female client (Post-menopausal) with high stress and a history of yo-yo dieting presents for coaching. What should be the first priority in her intervention plan?",
            "options": [
                "A 25% calorie deficit and 5 days of HIIT training",
                "A 'Metabolic Repair' or maintenance phase focused on stress management and circadian rhythm regulation",
                "A ketogenic diet to quickly address abdominal fat",
                "Intermittent fasting with a 20:4 window to maximize autophagy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given her history of yo-yo dieting (metabolic adaptation), menopause (hormonal shifts), and high stress (cortisol), adding a large deficit or high-intensity exercise would likely worsen her metabolic profile. A maintenance phase to 'reset' is the safest and most effective starting point."
