            "question": "During indirect calorimetry, a client presents with a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.72. What does this value primarily indicate regarding their substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates.",
                "The client is in a state of mixed substrate oxidation.",
                "The client is almost exclusively oxidizing fatty acids.",
                "The client is experiencing high levels of anaerobic glycolysis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 shows the client is utilizing fat as their primary fuel source, typical in a fasted or ketogenic state."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When using DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) for body composition, which metric is considered the most clinically significant for predicting metabolic syndrome risk?",
            "options": [
                "Total Body Fat Percentage",
                "Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) mass/volume",
                "Appendicular Lean Mass Index (ALMI)",
                "Gynoid-to-Android fat ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While total fat matters, VAT (Visceral Adipose Tissue) is the most metabolically active and dangerous fat. A VAT area greater than 100 cm² is strongly associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client’s blood panel shows an hs-CRP level of 4.2 mg/L and a HOMA-IR score of 3.8. How should a coach interpret these biomarkers?",
            "options": [
                "The client is metabolically healthy with low systemic inflammation.",
                "The client has optimal insulin sensitivity but high acute inflammation.",
                "The client exhibits systemic inflammation and significant insulin resistance.",
                "The client has low inflammation but is at risk for reactive hypoglycemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP > 3.0 mg/L indicates high systemic inflammation, and a HOMA-IR > 2.5 is a standard clinical threshold for insulin resistance. Both markers suggest metabolic dysfunction."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which subscale of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) is most predictive of weight regain if scores remain high during the maintenance phase?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Restraint",
                "Disinhibition",

                "Emotional Eating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disinhibition (the tendency to lose control over eating in response to external cues or emotional states) is a primary psychological predictor of weight regain and inability to maintain a deficit."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In a Gut Health Screening, elevated levels of fecal Zonulin are used as a proxy biomarker for which condition?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract wall. Elevated levels indicate 'leaky gut,' which can trigger systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "According to the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) data, 'Social Jetlag'—the discrepancy between sleep timing on work days vs. free days—is linked to obesity. For every hour of social jetlag, the likelihood of being overweight increases by approximately:",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (Roenneberg et al.) has shown that every hour of social jetlag (sleep mid-point shift) is associated with a 33% increase in the likelihood of obesity, regardless of sleep duration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A score of 14 or less on the 21-point FMS scale has been identified in multiple studies as the 'cutoff' where injury risk increases significantly during physical interventions."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A coach uses the 'Maintenance Readiness Index.' Which behavioral metric is cited by the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) as the strongest predictor of long-term (5+ years) weight loss maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to a low-carbohydrate diet",
                "Monthly visits to a clinical dietitian",
                "High levels of physical activity (approx. 60–90 mins/day)",
                "Daily use of meal replacement shakes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The NWCR data consistently shows that the most successful 'maintainers' engage in high levels of physical activity, averaging roughly 1 hour or more of moderate-intensity exercise daily."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (Age 42) has an RMR of 1,450 kcal measured via indirect calorimetry. Her Physical Activity Level (PAL) is 1.4. What is her estimated Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)?",
            "options": [
                "1,450 kcal",
                "1,740 kcal",
                "2,030 kcal",
                "2,320 kcal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TDEE is calculated as RMR × PAL. 1,450 × 1.4 = 2,030 kcal. This provides the baseline for determining her necessary caloric deficit."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which biomarker is the most sensitive early indicator of 'overreaching' or 'metabolic adaptation' in a client who has been in a prolonged caloric deficit?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)",
                "Creatinine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 acts as a 'brake' on metabolism. When the body senses prolonged energy scarcity or stress, it converts T4 into rT3 (inactive) rather than Free T3 (active), signaling metabolic adaptation."
