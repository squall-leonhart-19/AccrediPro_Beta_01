            "question": "When utilizing indirect calorimetry to determine a client's Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), what does a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.70 primarily indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates.",
                "The client is in a state of pure protein catabolism.",
                "The client is primarily oxidizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The client is experiencing metabolic alkalosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.70 indicates that 100% of the fuel source being oxidized is fat. An RQ of 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation, while a mixed diet typically results in an RQ of around 0.85."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "Which advanced body composition metric is most closely associated with cardiometabolic risk and is best measured via DEXA or specialized Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)?",
            "options": [
                "Appendicular Lean Mass Index (ALMI)",
                "Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) is the fat stored within the abdominal cavity around internal organs. High levels are strongly correlated with insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular disease."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While thresholds can vary slightly by lab, a HOMA-IR score > 2.5 is widely accepted as a clinical indicator of insulin resistance, reflecting a suboptimal relationship between fasting glucose and insulin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The TFEQ-R21 is a validated tool for identifying the behavioral drivers of calorie intake: cognitive restraint (conscious restriction), uncontrolled eating (loss of control), and emotional eating (eating in response to negative affect)."

            "question": "A client's blood panel shows a High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) level of 4.2 mg/L. How should a Weight Loss Coach interpret this in the context of Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "This is a normal level and requires no intervention.",
                "This indicates high cardiovascular risk and systemic low-grade inflammation.",
                "This suggests the client is in an acute state of muscle hypertrophy.",
                "This indicates a deficiency in Vitamin D3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP level > 3.0 mg/L is categorized as high risk for cardiovascular disease and indicates systemic inflammation, which can impair leptin sensitivity and fat loss progress."

            "question": "According to Functional Movement and Strength Diagnostics, why is 'Grip Strength' considered a vital assessment tool for weight loss clients?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the client's ability to hold heavy dumbbells.",
                "It is a validated proxy for total body muscular strength and a predictor of all-cause mortality.",
                "It determines the client's neurological speed.",
                "It is used to calculate the client's daily fiber requirements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Handgrip strength is a powerful biomarker of aging and muscle quality. In weight loss, it ensures that weight reduction is not coming at the expense of critical lean tissue (sarcopenia)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A PSQI score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. Clinical data shows that sleep deprivation significantly alters hunger hormones, increasing ghrelin (hunger) and decreasing leptin (satiety)."

                "To determine if a client should start a ketogenic diet.",
                "To assess if a client has the psychological and behavioral stability to transition out of a deficit.",
                "To calculate the exact number of cheat meals allowed.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintenance readiness tools evaluate factors like autonomous motivation, body image flexibility, and stress management to ensure the client can sustain weight loss long-term without rebounding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis is the process where the body downregulates its metabolic rate beyond what is predicted by the loss of body mass, often as a survival response to prolonged caloric restriction."
