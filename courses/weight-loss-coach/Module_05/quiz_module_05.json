            "question": "According to the muscle-metabolism connection, how does the metabolic rate of skeletal muscle compare to adipose tissue (fat) at rest?",
            "options": [
                "Muscle is 10x more metabolically active than fat.",
                "Muscle burns approximately 13 kcal/kg/day, while fat burns approximately 4.5 kcal/kg/day.",
                "Muscle and fat have nearly identical resting metabolic rates; the benefit is only during exercise.",
                "Fat is more metabolically active at rest to maintain body temperature."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that skeletal muscle has a resting metabolic rate of approximately 13 kcal/kg (6 kcal/lb) per day, which is nearly three times higher than the 4.5 kcal/kg (2 kcal/lb) per day burned by adipose tissue."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which myokine, released by skeletal muscle during contraction, is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Irisin",
                "Myostatin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Irisin is a myokine secreted during resistance training that travels through the bloodstream, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and increases BDNF, which supports cognitive health and neuroplasticity."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Skeletal muscle is responsible for approximately what percentage of postprandial (post-meal) glucose disposal?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "45-55%",
                "70-80%",
                "95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle is the primary site for glucose uptake, accounting for 70-80% of glucose disposal following a meal, making it a critical organ for metabolic health and insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the context of hypertrophy, which of the following is considered the primary driver of muscle growth?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolic stress (the 'pump')",
                "Mechanical tension",
                "Muscle damage (soreness)",
                "Cardiovascular endurance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While metabolic stress and muscle damage contribute, mechanical tension—the force applied to muscle fibers during resistance—is the most critical factor for initiating the signaling pathways for hypertrophy."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A client is performing a squat. Which modality would typically provide the highest level of neural drive and stabilization requirement?",
            "options": [
                "Leg Press Machine",
                "Smith Machine Squat",
                "Barbell Back Squat",
                "Resistance Band Squat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Free weights, like the Barbell Back Squat, require significant stabilization from synergistic muscles and have higher neural demands compared to fixed-path machines like the leg press or Smith machine."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When designing an 'L1 Strength' program for a beginner, what is the recommended frequency for full-body resistance training sessions?",
            "options": [
                "1 day per week",
                "2-3 non-consecutive days per week",
                "5-6 consecutive days per week",
                "Every other day regardless of soreness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For beginners, 2-3 non-consecutive days per week allows for the necessary 48-72 hours of recovery between sessions while providing enough frequency to trigger adaptation."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "To maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS), what is the recommended 'leucine threshold' per meal for most adults?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "10 - 15 grams",
                "Protein timing does not require a specific leucine amount."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Trigger' hypothesis suggests that roughly 2.5 to 3 grams of the amino acid leucine are required in a single meal to fully activate the mTOR pathway and initiate muscle protein synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "During a calorie deficit for weight loss, why is high protein intake (1.6 - 2.2g/kg) combined with resistance training essential?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the speed of fat digestion",
                "To prevent the body from entering ketosis",
                "To spare lean body mass and ensure weight loss comes primarily from fat stores",
                "To reduce the need for sleep and recovery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When in a deficit, the body may catabolize muscle for energy. High protein intake and resistance training provide the signal and building blocks to preserve muscle, ensuring the 'quality' of weight loss is high (fat loss, not muscle loss)."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "The 'Supercompensation' model suggests that the best time to apply a new training stimulus is:",
            "options": [
                "During the fatigue phase to build mental toughness",
                "Immediately after the workout finishes",
                "During the peak of the supercompensation phase",
                "After the involution phase when the body has returned to baseline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Applying a new stimulus during the supercompensation peak (when the body has recovered and slightly over-reached its previous baseline) leads to progressive gains in fitness and strength."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A female client expresses fear that lifting heavy weights will make her look 'bulky.' Which coaching response is most evidence-based?",
            "options": [
                "Agree that heavy weights cause bulk and suggest only using 2lb dumbbells.",
                "Explain that women have 10-20x less testosterone than men, making significant hypertrophy difficult without specific high-volume training and a large caloric surplus.",
                "Tell her that 'bulk' is only caused by eating too much protein.",
                "Suggest she only performs cardio, as strength training is not necessary for weight loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the 'bulking' myth requires explaining physiological differences. Women generally lack the testosterone levels required for rapid, massive muscle growth, and 'bulk' is typically a result of muscle gain combined with high body fat, rather than muscle alone."
