            "question": "According to metabolic research, what is the approximate caloric expenditure of one kilogram of skeletal muscle compared to one kilogram of adipose tissue at rest?",
            "options": [
                "Muscle: 13 kcal/kg/day; Fat: 4.5 kcal/kg/day",
                "Muscle: 25 kcal/kg/day; Fat: 2 kcal/kg/day",
                "Muscle: 50 kcal/kg/day; Fat: 10 kcal/kg/day",
                "Muscle and fat burn approximately the same amount of calories at rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While often exaggerated in popular media, skeletal muscle is roughly 3 times more metabolically active than fat tissue at rest, contributing significantly to Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) over time."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In the landmark 2010 study by Nedeltcheva et al., how did limiting sleep to 5.5 hours per night affect fat loss results in subjects on a caloric deficit?",
            "options": [
                "It increased fat loss by 10% due to more time spent awake.",
                "It had no significant impact on the composition of weight lost.",
                "It reduced fat loss by 55% and increased lean mass loss by 60%.",
                "It increased appetite but did not change metabolic substrate utilization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that sleep deprivation shifts the body's substrate utilization, causing the body to preserve fat and break down lean tissue for energy during a deficit."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "To maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS), what is the 'Leucine Threshold' typically required per meal for most healthy adults?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "7.0 - 10.0 grams",
                "Leucine content does not matter as long as total protein is high."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leucine acts as the primary chemical trigger for the mTOR pathway. Most research suggests 2.5 to 3 grams of leucine is necessary to 'flip the switch' for MPS."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Muscle Full Effect' in the context of protein ingestion?",
            "options": [
                "The feeling of satiety after consuming a high-protein steak.",
                "The point at which muscle cells are physically unable to stretch further.",
                "A refractory period where MPS cannot be further stimulated regardless of additional protein intake.",
                "The temporary swelling (pump) experienced immediately after resistance training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Muscle Full Effect describes the phenomenon where MPS returns to baseline levels after 2-3 hours despite continued high amino acid availability in the blood."

            "question": "A 65-year-old client is losing weight but their body fat percentage remains unchanged, and they report increased frailty. What condition are they likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolic Adaptation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarcopenic obesity is the co-occurrence of high adiposity and low muscle mass/strength, often exacerbated by weight loss attempts that do not include resistance training."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When programming resistance training specifically for muscle preservation during an aggressive fat loss phase, which variable should be prioritized to maintain lean mass?",
            "options": [
                "Extremely high repetitions (25+) to 'burn' more fat.",
                "Training Intensity (maintaining heavy loads/RPE).",
                "Increasing rest intervals to 10 minutes between sets.",
                "Reducing protein intake to allow for more carbohydrates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To signal the body that muscle tissue is 'necessary,' one must maintain high intensity (load) and effort (RPE). High reps with low weight are often insufficient to preserve type II muscle fibers during a deficit."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Which biomarker is most commonly used in clinical settings to assess systemic inflammation that might impair recovery and muscle preservation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CRP is a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation. Chronic elevation can indicate poor recovery and is associated with increased muscle catabolism."

            "question": "What is the primary physiological difference between 'Functional Overreaching' and 'Overtraining Syndrome' (OTS)?",
            "options": [
                "Overreaching involves muscle growth, while OTS involves muscle loss.",
                "Overreaching requires a few days to a week of recovery, while OTS can take months to resolve.",
                "Overreaching only happens to elite athletes, while OTS happens to beginners.",
                "There is no difference; they are synonymous terms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional overreaching is a planned phase of hard training followed by a deload. OTS is a serious neuroendocrine condition resulting from long-term imbalance between stress and recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creatine Monohydrate is one of the most researched supplements, proven to help maintain training intensity and cell hydration, which supports muscle preservation during fat loss."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A client has been in a 25% caloric deficit for 8 weeks. Their strength in the squat has dropped by 15%, and they report resting heart rates 10 bpm higher than usual. What is the most appropriate coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the caloric deficit to 35% to finish the phase faster.",
                "Add 30 minutes of daily HIIT to boost endorphins.",
                "Implement a 1-week diet break at maintenance calories and a training deload.",
                "Switch to a carnivore diet to increase protein-induced thermogenesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increased resting heart rate and significant strength loss are signs of accumulated systemic fatigue and potential under-recovery. A diet break and training deload help restore hormonal balance and reduce inflammation."
