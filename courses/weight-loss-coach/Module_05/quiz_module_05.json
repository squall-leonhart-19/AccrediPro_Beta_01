            "question": "In the context of the 'Muscle-Metabolism Connection,' how much does 1kg of skeletal muscle contribute to Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) compared to 1kg of adipose tissue?",
            "options": [
                "13 kcal/day vs 4.5 kcal/day",

                "100 kcal/day vs 2 kcal/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While muscle is more metabolically active than fat, the difference is modest; muscle burns approximately 13 kcal/kg per day at rest, while fat burns about 4.5 kcal/kg."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual exposure and building self-efficacy in a low-threat environment (like home) allows the client to build the competence needed to eventually feel comfortable in a gym setting."

            "id": "q5_10",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher protein intakes (1.6g to 2.2g per kg) are necessary during a deficit to protect muscle tissue from being oxidized for energy and to support recovery from strength training."
