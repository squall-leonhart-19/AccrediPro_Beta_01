            "question": "Which brain structure is primarily responsible for the 'automation' of habits, effectively offloading tasks from the prefrontal cortex to save metabolic energy?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Thalamus",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia, specifically the striatum, is the neurological 'autopilot' where habits are stored once they become routine, allowing the Prefrontal Cortex to focus on more complex decision-making."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the 'Reset Protocol' for hunger, which characteristic is a hallmark of emotional hunger rather than physical hunger?",
            "options": [
                "It builds gradually over several hours",
                "It is felt as a physical sensation in the stomach",
                "It is specific to a particular food or texture (e.g., 'I need chocolate')",
                "It is easily satisfied by any nutrient-dense meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional hunger is typically sudden and characterized by specific cravings for 'comfort foods,' whereas physical hunger is gradual and less discriminating about the type of food consumed."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A landmark study on 'Choice Architecture' in a hospital cafeteria demonstrated that simply rearranging the visibility of beverages (moving water to eye level) increased water sales by 25.8%. This is an example of what concept?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Proximity Effect (or 'Convenience Effect') posits that we are significantly more likely to consume what is most visible and physically accessible in our immediate environment."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Ultra-processed foods are engineered to reach the 'Bliss Point.' What does this term specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The point where a food contains zero calories",
                "The precise ratio of salt, sugar, and fat that maximizes dopamine release and overrides satiety",
                "The temperature at which food tastes best to the average consumer",
                "The moment a client feels 100% full after a meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bliss Point is the optimal concentration of salt, sugar, and fats that maximizes behavioral reinforcement by stimulating the brain's reward system without triggering the 'stop' signals of satiety."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "According to Peter Gollwitzer’s research, 'Implementation Intentions' (If-Then planning) increase the probability of goal attainment by what approximate effect size?",
            "options": [
                "Small (d=0.20)",

                "Negligible (d=0.05)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that 'If-Then' planning has a large effect size (d=0.65) because it automates the response to a specific cue, bypassing the need for active willpower."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Why does a buffet often lead to overeating even when a person is physically full? Which concept from Lesson 6 explains this?",

                "The Abstinence Violation Effect",
                "Hyperpalatability Syndrome",

                "The Dopamine Dip"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory-Specific Satiety (SSS) is the phenomenon where our interest in a specific flavor declines as we eat it, but our appetite for different flavors remains high, leading to increased intake when variety is present."

            "options": [
                "It must be a new, healthy behavior you want to start",
                "It must be a behavior that requires significant effort",
                "It must be an existing, non-negotiable part of your current daily routine",
                "It must be related to exercise or physical activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An anchor must be an established habit (like brushing teeth or pouring morning coffee) to provide a reliable neurological 'hook' for the new habit to attach to."

            "id": "q2_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE) occurs when a 'slip' is perceived as a total failure, leading to guilt, loss of control, and a full-blown relapse ('the what-the-hell effect')."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for 'craving' and the 'anticipation' of a reward, rather than the actual pleasure of the reward itself?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Dopamine",
                "Endorphins",
                "Leptin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the neurotransmitter of 'wanting' and motivation. It spikes during the 'Cue' and 'Craving' phases of the habit loop to drive the behavior toward the reward."

            "id": "q2_10",

                "Storing snacks in clear glass jars on the coffee table",
                "Moving the snacks to an opaque container in a high, hard-to-reach cabinet in a different room",
                "Telling themselves they can only have snacks if they feel 'true' hunger"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increasing 'friction' (making the food harder to reach) and reducing 'visibility' (using opaque containers) are the most effective environmental interventions to break a mindless habit loop."
