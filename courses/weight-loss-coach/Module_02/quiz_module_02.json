            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "An individual's Respiratory Quotient (RQ) is measured at 0.72 during a fasted state. What does this value primarily indicate regarding their substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The individual is burning almost exclusively carbohydrates.",
                "The individual is in a state of high metabolic inflexibility.",
                "The individual is predominantly oxidizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The individual has reached the lactate threshold."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 suggests the individual is highly efficient at utilizing fat stores in a fasted state."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which rate-limiting enzyme is responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, and is often upregulated during fat adaptation?",
            "options": [
                "Hexokinase",
                "Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1)",
                "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase",
                "Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CPT-1 is the gatekeeper for fatty acid entry into the mitochondria. Upregulation of this enzyme is a hallmark of becoming 'fat adapted' and improving metabolic flexibility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In the context of mitochondrial bioenergetics, what is 'Mitochondrial Biogenesis' and why is it critical for weight loss coaching?",
            "options": [
                "The breakdown of damaged mitochondria via autophagy.",
                "The process of turning glucose into ATP without oxygen.",
                "The creation of new mitochondria, increasing the capacity to oxidize fats and sugars.",
                "the storage of triglycerides within the mitochondrial matrix."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mitochondrial biogenesis increases the density and size of mitochondria, effectively increasing the 'engines' available to burn fuel, which enhances metabolic rate and flexibility."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Crossover Effect' in exercise physiology, as exercise intensity increases toward VO2 Max, how does substrate utilization typically shift?",
            "options": [
                "Reliance on lipid oxidation increases.",
                "Reliance on carbohydrate oxidation increases.",
                "Substrate utilization remains 50/50 regardless of intensity.",
                "The body begins utilizing protein as the primary fuel source."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The crossover point is the intensity where the energy derived from carbohydrates exceeds that from lipids. Higher intensities require faster ATP production, which glycolysis provides more readily than beta-oxidation."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 4.2. Based on Lesson 7, which intervention protocol is most scientifically supported to reverse this metabolic inflexibility?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing meal frequency to 6-8 small meals per day to 'stoke the metabolic fire'.",

                "Eliminating all forms of exercise until systemic inflammation decreases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR > 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance. TRF lowers insulin AUC (Area Under the Curve), while resistance training promotes non-insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation, improving glucose clearance."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "For a client utilizing blood ketone testing, which range is defined by researchers (e.g., Volek & Phinney) as 'Nutritional Ketosis'?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 0.4 mmol/L",
                "0.5 - 3.0 mmol/L",

                "Above 15.0 mmol/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutritional ketosis is generally defined as blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels between 0.5 and 3.0 mmol/L. Levels above 15.0 mmol/L are associated with ketoacidosis, a medical emergency."

            "question": "What is the primary physiological rationale behind 'Carb Backloading' for an athlete or active weight loss client?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize fat storage during the day.",
                "To ensure insulin is at its highest level during morning sedentary hours.",
                "To keep insulin low during the day to facilitate fat oxidation, while using evening carbs to replenish glycogen and support recovery.",
                "To prevent the 'dawn phenomenon' from occurring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Carb backloading aims to match carbohydrate intake with the period of highest insulin sensitivity (post-workout) and maintain high fat-burning rates during the earlier, sedentary part of the day."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "During a 24-hour fast, which process becomes the primary contributor to maintaining blood glucose levels after liver glycogen is depleted?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gluconeogenesis is the metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates like lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which of the following describes 'Metabolic Inflexibility' in a clinical setting?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to switch easily between burning fats and carbs.",
                "The inability to increase fat oxidation when fatty acid availability increases (fasting) or increase glucose oxidation during a meal.",
                "A state where the body only burns protein for fuel.",
                "Having a resting metabolic rate that is too high for the client's age."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic inflexibility is characterized by a 'blunted' response to fuel availability; the body remains stuck in one mode (usually carb-burning) regardless of whether it is fed or fasted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, a meta-analysis on Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) suggested that the weight loss observed was primarily due to:",
            "options": [
                "A magical 'metabolic advantage' of fasting 16 hours.",
                "The spontaneous reduction in total caloric intake (ad libitum reduction).",

                "Increased water retention masking fat loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While hormonal benefits exist, most clinical data shows that TRF works for weight loss primarily because narrowing the feeding window leads to a natural, spontaneous reduction in calorie intake."
