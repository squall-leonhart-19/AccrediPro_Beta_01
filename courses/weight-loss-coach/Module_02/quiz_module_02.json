            "question": "Which specific region of the brain is responsible for the 'automation' of habits, effectively shifting control away from the prefrontal cortex once a behavior becomes repetitive?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia, specifically the striatum, is the primary site for habit formation and execution. As a behavior becomes habitual, brain activity shifts from the Prefrontal Cortex (conscious decision-making) to the Basal Ganglia (automaticity)."

                "Hypoglycemic Signaling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional hunger is characterized by sudden onset, a craving for specific 'comfort' foods, and is often triggered by psychological stressors rather than physiological energy needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice Architecture involves structuring the environment (e.g., placing fruit on the counter and hiding treats in a high cabinet) to nudge the individual toward better choices without relying solely on willpower."

                "The temperature at which food tastes most palatable to the average consumer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Bliss Point is a term used in food science to describe the specific optimization of salt, sugar, and fat that triggers the highest level of reward signaling (dopamine) in the brain, often leading to overconsumption."

            "question": "According to the research on Implementation Intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999), why are 'If-Then' plans more effective than general goal intentions?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the client's metabolic rate through anticipation",
                "They delegate control of the behavior to situational cues, bypassing the need for conscious deliberation",
                "They eliminate the possibility of encountering obstacles",
                "They focus exclusively on the long-term rewards of weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions work by creating a mental link between a specific situational cue ('If') and a planned response ('Then'), which allows the behavior to be triggered automatically when the cue is encountered."

            "options": [
                "People eat more when presented with a wide variety of flavors (e.g., a buffet)",
                "People stop eating because they are physically full",
                "Bitter foods suppress appetite more than sweet foods",
                "Drinking water before a meal reduces caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory-Specific Satiety refers to the decline in pleasantness of a specific food as it is consumed. However, when a new flavor profile is introduced, the appetite is 'renewed,' which is why variety often leads to higher caloric intake."

                "The anchor must be a brand-new behavior the client has never done",
                "The anchor must be an existing, high-frequency habit that occurs regardless of motivation",
                "The anchor must be a physical object, like a sticky note",
                "The anchor must be a reward, like a piece of dark chocolate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A successful anchor must be a 'stable' habit that already exists in the client's routine (e.g., brushing teeth or boiling the kettle). This provides a reliable trigger for the new habit to 'stack' onto."

                "A lack of protein in the diet",
                "The perception of having 'broken' a strict dietary rule, leading to a total loss of inhibition",
                "A physiological drop in blood glucose levels",
                "Excessive exercise without adequate recovery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'What the Hell Effect' is a psychological cycle where a perceived lapse in a diet leads to guilt, which then leads to the abandonment of all dietary restraints for the remainder of the day or week."

                "A small effect (d = 0.20)",
                "A medium-to-large effect (d = 0.65)",
                "No significant effect compared to willpower",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis of 94 studies showed a medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.65) for implementation intentions, significantly outperforming mere goal intentions in changing health behaviors."

                "Suggesting the client try a more restrictive 'crash' diet",
                "Reframing the plateau as data/feedback rather than failure, and focusing on process-based wins",
                "Telling the client they simply need more discipline",
                "Ignoring the plateau and hoping it resolves itself"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A growth mindset views challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and refining the process. Reframing a plateau as 'neutral data' helps the client maintain self-efficacy and continue with their habits."
