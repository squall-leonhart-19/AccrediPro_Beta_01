            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how 'obesogens' like Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates contribute to adipogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "By directly increasing the caloric density of the foods they contaminate",
                "By activating the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ), the master regulator of adipogenesis",
                "By increasing the body's core temperature and slowing down the basal metabolic rate",
                "By inhibiting the absorption of dietary fiber in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obesogens are endocrine disruptors that interfere with lipid metabolism and adipogenesis, primarily by activating PPARγ, which triggers the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes (fat cells)."

            "options": [
                "A food desert lacks access to affordable healthy food, while a food swamp has an overabundance of high-calorie, low-nutrient food options",
                "A food desert refers to rural areas, while a food swamp refers strictly to coastal urban areas",
                "A food swamp has no food available, while a food desert has only organic options",
                "There is no distinction; both terms describe areas with high walkability and high fruit intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 'Food Swamps' (areas with a high density of fast food and convenience stores) are often stronger predictors of obesity than 'Food Deserts' (areas lacking fresh produce)."

            "options": [
                "They have a genetic predisposition to store more fat than higher-income individuals",
                "Energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods are often the most affordable and accessible options during periods of food insecurity",
                "They generally require fewer calories due to lower physical activity levels in manual labor jobs",
                "Lower-income housing usually has higher concentrations of atmospheric oxygen which slows metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The paradox highlights that food insecurity leads to the consumption of inexpensive, shelf-stable, high-calorie processed foods, which promotes weight gain despite a lack of total food security."

            "question": "Chronic stress triggers the HPA axis to release cortisol. How does prolonged cortisol elevation specifically influence fat distribution?",

                "It promotes the mobilization of fat from the abdominal region to the extremities",
                "It increases the activity of Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) specifically in visceral adipose tissue",
                "It causes a total body reduction in fat by increasing 'fight or flight' energy expenditure",
                "It inhibits the production of insulin, leading to rapid subcutaneous fat loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol promotes visceral (deep abdominal) fat storage by increasing the activity of Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in the trunk area, which is more sensitive to cortisol than subcutaneous fat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that drinking 500ml of water increased metabolic rate by 30%, with the increase occurring within 10 minutes and reaching a maximum after 30–40 minutes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pre-loading with protein and fiber stabilizes blood sugar and triggers satiety hormones, reducing the likelihood of impulsive overconsumption of hyper-palatable event foods."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Delboeuf Illusion suggests that the same amount of food looks larger on a smaller plate, leading to increased satisfaction with smaller portions through environmental design."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lipolysis is a hydrolysis reaction, meaning water molecules are chemically consumed to break the bonds of triglycerides so they can be used for energy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental control (stimulus control) is more effective than willpower. Creating a physical and temporal boundary (Kitchen Closed) breaks the environmental cue associated with grazing."
