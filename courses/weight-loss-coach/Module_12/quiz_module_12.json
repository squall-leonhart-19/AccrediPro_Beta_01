            "question": "According to the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), what is the average daily duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity reported by individuals who successfully maintain a 30lb+ weight loss for over a year?",
            "options": [
                "30 minutes per day",
                "45 minutes per day",
                "60 minutes per day",
                "90 minutes per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research from the NWCR consistently shows that successful maintainers engage in approximately 60 minutes of physical activity daily, which serves as a 'defense' against weight regain."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "What physiological phenomenon explains why the body's Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) often remains lower than predicted even after weight loss has ceased?",
            "options": [
                "Adaptive Thermogenesis",
                "Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption",
                "The Thermic Effect of Food",
                "Hyperplasia of Adipocytes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Thermogenesis is the metabolic slowing that occurs during weight loss and often persists into maintenance, requiring the individual to consume fewer calories than a weight-matched peer who was never overweight."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When implementing a 'Nutritional Transition' (Reverse Dieting), what is the recommended weekly caloric increment to safely find a client's new maintenance level?",
            "options": [
                "250 - 500 calories per week",
                "50 - 100 calories per week",
                "Maintain the deficit for an additional 4 weeks",
                "Immediately return to the pre-diet caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titrating calories upward by 50-100 kcal per week allows the metabolism to adjust and helps identify the precise maintenance point without triggering rapid fat storage."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In the context of Cognitive Shifts, what is meant by 'Habit Automaticity'?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to track calories without using an app",
                "The point where healthy behaviors require minimal conscious effort or willpower",
                "The use of wearable technology to track movement automatically",
                "The biological drive to return to old eating patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit Automaticity is the 'holy grail' of maintenance, where the cognitive load of making healthy choices is reduced because the behaviors have become ingrained in the client's identity."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A 'Reset Protocol' is an early warning system. At what weight threshold should a client typically trigger their 'Red Zone' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "1 lb above goal weight",
                "3-5 lbs above goal weight",

                "When their BMI moves up by one full point"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 3-5 lb 'buffer' or 'Red Zone' allows for normal water weight fluctuations while providing a clear, objective signal to implement the Reset Protocol before a minor slip becomes a full relapse."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Maintenance Paradox' in coaching?",
            "options": [
                "The client loses more weight while trying to maintain",
                "The biological drive to eat increases as the body gets thinner",
                "Success in maintenance is defined by 'nothing happening,' which provides less dopamine than the 'wins' of active weight loss",
                "Exercise becomes less effective at burning calories over time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Maintenance Paradox refers to the psychological challenge where the lack of visible progress (the scale staying the same) is less rewarding than the constant feedback of weight loss, often leading to boredom or complacency."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Social Engineering, what is the primary goal of 'Choice Architecture'?",
            "options": [
                "To convince family members to diet with the client",
                "To design the environment so that the healthiest choice is the easiest/default choice",
                "To build a home gym that is visually appealing",
                "To calculate the exact macro-nutrient ratios of social meals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice Architecture involves modifying the environment (e.g., using smaller plates, keeping fruit on the counter) to make healthy behaviors the 'path of least resistance.'"

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "A client reaches their goal weight and transitions to maintenance. Within the first week, the scale jumps 2.5 lbs despite them following the titration plan. What is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid fat gain due to metabolic damage",
                "A failure in the self-monitoring equipment",
                "Glycogen replenishment and associated intracellular water retention",
                "Muscle hypertrophy from increased energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When increasing carbohydrates and calories, the body replenishes glycogen stores. Each gram of glycogen holds approximately 3-4 grams of water, leading to a predictable but non-fat increase in scale weight."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Which coaching model focuses on the shift from 'External Regulation' (doing it for the coach or the scale) to 'Integrated Regulation' (doing it because it aligns with one's core values)?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)",
                "Self-Determination Theory (SDT)",
                "The Transtheoretical Model",
                "The Health Belief Model"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-Determination Theory is critical in maintenance, as it moves the client toward autonomous motivation and identity integration, which are essential for long-term adherence."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "What is the 'False Hope Syndrome' in the context of relapse prevention?",
            "options": [
                "Believing that maintenance will be easier than weight loss",
                "Setting unrealistic expectations for how life will change once the weight is lost, leading to disappointment and relapse",
                "The belief that one can return to old eating habits once the goal is reached",
                "Trusting the scale over body composition measurements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "False Hope Syndrome occurs when clients expect weight loss to solve all personal or social problems. When these problems persist, they may lose the motivation to maintain their new weight."
