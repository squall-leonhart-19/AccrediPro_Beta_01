            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "According to the physiology of weight maintenance, what is the primary reason 'metabolic adaptation' persists even after weight loss has ceased?",
            "options": [
                "A permanent reduction in thyroid hormone production",
                "A persistent decrease in leptin levels and an increase in ghrelin, driving increased hunger",
                "The irreversible loss of brown adipose tissue during the deficit phase",
                "The body's inability to utilize glycogen efficiently after a long-term deficit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic adaptation involves hormonal shifts, specifically lower leptin (satiety) and higher ghrelin (hunger), which often persist long-term, making maintenance a physiological challenge."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "When transitioning a client from a deficit to maintenance (Lesson 2), what is the recommended 'Reverse Dieting' increment to minimize fat overshoot?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing daily intake by 500-700 calories immediately",
                "Increasing daily intake by 50-100 calories every 2 weeks",
                "Increasing daily intake by 100-200 calories per week while monitoring weight stability",
                "Remaining at the deficit calories but doubling protein intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A controlled transition of 100-200 calories per week allows the metabolism to stabilize and helps identify the new maintenance caloric 'sweet spot' without rapid fat regain."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Data from the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) indicates that successful maintainers (those who keep off 30+ lbs for 1+ years) typically engage in how much physical activity?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 150 minutes of moderate activity per week",
                "Approximately 60-90 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity daily",
                "Only 20 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) twice a week",
                "Physical activity was found to be less important than calorie restriction for maintenance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NWCR shows that high levels of physical activity (roughly 60-90 minutes daily) are one of the strongest predictors of long-term weight maintenance success."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 3-5 Pound Rule is a self-monitoring strategy where a specific 'red zone' weight is identified. If the client hits this number, they immediately revert to their weight-loss phase habits to prevent further regain."

            "options": [
                "The coach should become more authoritative to prevent the client from slipping",
                "The coach should transition to a 'Consultant' role, focusing on autonomy and identity integration",
                "The coach should stop meeting with the client to test their independence",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintenance coaching requires a shift toward supporting the client's autonomy and helping them integrate their new behaviors into their permanent identity."

            "question": "A 2020 meta-analysis mentioned in the module found that individuals who weigh themselves daily or weekly are how much more likely to maintain their weight loss compared to those who don't?",
            "options": [
                "No difference was found in maintenance rates",
                "10% more likely",
                "2-3 times more likely",
                "They were actually less likely due to increased anxiety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent self-monitoring via weighing is consistently correlated with significantly higher (2-3x) maintenance success rates in clinical literature."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah has reached her goal weight of 150 lbs. During her first month of maintenance, she hits 154 lbs after a vacation. What is the most 'AccrediPro' aligned intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Tell her it's just water weight and to ignore the scale for a month",
                "Immediately place her on a 3-day juice fast to detox",
                "Initiate the 'Reset Protocol': a 2-week return to her previous deficit calories and increased monitoring",
                "Suggest she switch to a different diet entirely, as this one is clearly failing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Reset Protocol' is a proactive, non-emotional response to hitting a pre-defined threshold, ensuring that minor gains are corrected before they become major regains."
