            "question": "In the context of 'Strategic Positioning & Niche Mastery', why is being a 'generalist' weight loss coach considered a high-risk business strategy?",
            "options": [
                "It requires too much specialized equipment to maintain.",
                "It leads to 'commodity pricing' where you are forced to compete on price rather than unique value.",
                "Generalists are legally prohibited from working with more than three demographics.",
                "The marketing costs for generalists are 90% lower, leading to poor visibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generalists compete in a 'red ocean' where they are seen as a commodity. Specialists can charge premium prices because they solve a specific problem for a specific person, increasing perceived value."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prescribing medication or supplements to treat a medical condition (like edema) is practicing medicine without a license. Coaches must refer medical issues to licensed professionals."

            "explanation": "Challenging the status quo helps the client see that their current trajectory is not serving them, creating the 'tension' necessary for them to commit to a real change."
