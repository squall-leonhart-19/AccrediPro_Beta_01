            "question": "When transitioning from 1-on-1 coaching to a 'Group Coaching Architecture' (L1), what is the most critical structural requirement to maintain high client success rates?",
            "options": [
                "Reducing the amount of educational content provided to simplify the process.",
                "Moving from bespoke plans to a standardized core curriculum with individualized 'Office Hour' support.",
                "Increasing the number of 1-on-1 calls included in the group package.",
                "Charging a lower price point to account for the lack of individual attention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To scale effectively, a coach must move from 'trading time for money' to a leveraged model. This involves a standardized curriculum that addresses 80% of client needs, while using group sessions (Office Hours) to handle the 20% of individual nuances."

            "question": "According to the lesson on Leveraging Technology (L2), how does a 'Centralized Metabolic Dashboard' assist a coach in managing 50+ clients simultaneously?",
            "options": [
                "It automatically sends marketing emails to potential leads.",
                "It replaces the need for any human interaction or coaching calls.",
                "It aggregates real-time data (CGM, HRV, weight) to flag 'outlier' clients who need urgent intervention.",
                "It generates AI-written meal plans without coach supervision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "At scale, 'management by exception' is key. Dashboards allow coaches to see which clients are off-track (e.g., blood glucose spikes or low compliance) so they can intervene precisely where needed rather than checking in on everyone equally."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "In a Multi-Coach Practice (L3), what is the primary purpose of 'Clinical Decision-Making SOPs'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure every coach under the brand provides consistent, evidence-based recommendations regardless of their personal bias.",
                "To prevent coaches from talking to clients without the lead coach present.",
                "To track the number of hours each employee works per week.",
                "To automate the billing process for high-ticket clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for clinical decisions ensure brand consistency and safety. Without them, client outcomes vary wildly depending on which coach they are assigned, which devalues the overall practice."

            "id": "q35_4",
            "question": "Which factor most significantly differentiates a 'High-Ticket' ($5,000+) program from a 'Low-Ticket' membership ($50/mo)?",

                "The speed and certainty of the specific metabolic transformation promised.",
                "The amount of 'unlimited' access the client has to the coach's private phone number."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket pricing is based on the value of the outcome (e.g., reversing Type 2 Diabetes markers or losing 50lbs) and the speed/certainty of that result, rather than the volume of content or the coach's time."

                "A marketing strategy that involves placing flyers in doctor's waiting rooms.",
                "A method for coaches to prescribe medication under a doctor's supervision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic partnerships thrive on mutual value. By sending professional progress reports to a client's physician, the coach demonstrates clinical utility, which leads to more high-quality medical referrals."

            "id": "q35_6",
            "question": "If your business has a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $400 and a Lifetime Value (LTV) of $2,400, what is your LTV:CAC ratio, and what does it indicate about your scaling potential (L6)?",

                "2:1; the business is breaking even but cannot afford to hire new staff.",
                "10:1; the business is overcharging clients and will likely see high churn."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 is considered the industry standard for health businesses. A 6:1 ratio ($2,400 / $400) indicates a very healthy margin, suggesting the coach can aggressively reinvest in growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authority building (whitepapers, case studies, speaking) establishes the coach as an expert before the prospect even hops on a call, which significantly reduces the time and effort needed to close a high-ticket sale."

                "When the founder sells the business for less than 2x EBITDA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A business is only an 'asset' if it can run without the owner. If the clients only want to work with the 'name on the door,' the business has little value to an outside buyer or for long-term longevity."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "A case study in L1 showed a coach scaling from 20 to 100 clients. What was the 'Key Performance Indicator' (KPI) that most accurately predicted client churn?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In group settings, community engagement is the leading indicator of retention. Clients who stop logging in or interacting are statistically much more likely to drop out before reaching their goals."

                "Pricing based on the total number of hours the coach spends on the client.",
                "Pricing based on the financial, emotional, and physical ROI the client receives from the transformation.",
                "Offering the lowest price in the market to attract the most customers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing looks at the 'cost of the problem' (e.g., medical bills, lost productivity, low confidence) versus the 'value of the solution.' This allows for premium pricing that supports better client support and outcomes."
