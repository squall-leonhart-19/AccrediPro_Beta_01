            "question": "According to the biology of weight regain discussed in Lesson 1, how do the peripheral hunger hormones leptin and ghrelin typically respond following a 10% reduction in body weight?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin decreases and ghrelin increases, creating a persistent 'hunger gap'.",
                "Leptin increases and ghrelin decreases to protect the new lower weight.",
                "Both hormones decrease to stabilize the metabolic rate.",
                "Both hormones increase, leading to improved metabolic flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Weight loss leads to a decrease in leptin (satiety hormone) and an increase in ghrelin (hunger hormone), a hormonal 'double whammy' that promotes weight regain."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Adaptive Thermogenesis (AT) can result in a Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) lower than predicted by body mass. Research cited in Lesson 2 indicates this suppression can persist for years and often ranges between:",
            "options": [
                "25-50 kcal/day",
                "150-500 kcal/day",

                "1000-1200 kcal/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those on 'The Biggest Loser' contestants, show that metabolic adaptation can suppress RMR by 150-500 kcal beyond what is expected from loss of tissue."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In the 'Advanced Habit Architecture' framework (Lesson 3), what is the primary goal of the 'Solidify' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the rate of fat loss through aggressive restriction.",
                "To transition from outcome-based goals to identity-based habits.",
                "To introduce complex supplement protocols to boost metabolism.",
                "To test the client's willpower by reintroducing trigger foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Solidify phase focuses on shifting the client's self-perception so that healthy behaviors become part of 'who they are' rather than just things they do to lose weight."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "When troubleshooting a plateau using the TRANSFORM Diagnostics (Lesson 4), what is the first 'Level 1' variable a coach should investigate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before assuming metabolic adaptation or medical issues, coaches must first rule out 'caloric creep'—the gradual decrease in tracking accuracy or increase in incidental eating."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AVE occurs when a person views a single lapse as a total failure, leading to a loss of control and a full relapse."

                "Immediately jump to the calculated TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).",
                "Add 500-1000 kcal per day in the first week.",
                "Increase daily intake by 2-5% or roughly 50-100 kcal per week while monitoring weight.",
                "Maintain the deficit but reduce protein while increasing fats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A slow, controlled increase (50-100 kcal/week) allows the metabolism to 'catch up' and minimizes fat regain during the transition."

                "Relying on sheer willpower to avoid unhealthy foods.",

                "Avoiding all social situations involving food for the first 6 months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice architecture involves designing the environment to make the healthy choice the easy or default choice, such as using smaller plates."

            "question": "In the Fothergill et al. (2016) study on 'The Biggest Loser' contestants, what happened to the participants' metabolic rates 6 years after the competition?",
            "options": [
                "Their RMR returned to normal levels once they regained the weight.",
                "Their RMR remained suppressed by an average of 499 kcal/day despite weight regain.",
                "Their RMR increased significantly due to permanent muscle gain.",
                "There was no measurable change in their metabolic rate compared to the start."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found 'persistent metabolic adaptation,' where RMR remained significantly lower than expected even 6 years later, contributing to weight regain."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah has hit a 4-week plateau. She is eating 1,300 calories, her sleep is poor (5 hours), and her stress is '10/10'. What is the most appropriate TRANSFORM diagnostic intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Reduce calories to 1,100 to break the plateau.",
                "Increase cardio from 3 days to 6 days per week.",
                "Implement a 1-2 week 'Diet Break' at maintenance calories to lower cortisol and restore bio-feedback.",
                "Tell her to 'try harder' with her tracking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When bio-feedback (sleep/stress) is poor and a plateau occurs, further restriction often backfires. A diet break helps normalize hormones and reduce stress-induced water retention."
