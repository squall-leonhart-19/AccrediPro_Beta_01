            "question": "Which biological mechanism primarily explains why appetite increases significantly after a weight loss of 10% or more?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in Ghrelin and an increase in PYY",
                "A decrease in Leptin and an increase in Ghrelin",
                "The suppression of the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "An increase in Insulin sensitivity within the adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight loss triggers a 'starvation response' where Leptin (the satiety hormone) decreases due to reduced fat mass, while Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) increases to drive energy intake back to the previous set point."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Metabolic flexibility is defined as the body's ability to switch efficiently between which two fuel sources?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility refers to the capacity to switch between oxidizing carbohydrates (glucose) and fats (fatty acids) based on availability and demand, a trait often impaired in those with metabolic syndrome."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In the 'Solidify' phase of Advanced Habit Architecture, what is the primary objective for the client?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the intensity of new behaviors to ensure rapid results",
                "To identify and 'Reset' maladaptive cues in the environment",
                "To achieve behavioral automaticity where the habit requires minimal cognitive load",
                "To implement a strict 21-day challenge to lock in the new identity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Solidify' phase focuses on moving behaviors from the prefrontal cortex (conscious effort) to the basal ganglia (automaticity), ensuring the habit persists during times of high stress."

            "id": "q13_4",

            "options": [

                "A potential underlying thyroid pathology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Thermogenesis often manifests first as a subconscious reduction in NEAT. Before assuming tracking errors or cutting calories further, coaches should assess if the client has become more sedentary outside of the gym."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "The 'Abstinence Violation Effect' (AVE) is a psychological phenomenon that often leads to relapse. How is it best described?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AVE occurs when a client perceives a minor lapse as a total failure, leading to feelings of guilt and a subsequent 'blowout' or binge because they feel the 'diet is already ruined.'"

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Research on 'Social Contagion' suggests that a person’s risk of becoming obese increases by what percentage if they have a close friend who becomes obese?",
            "options": [
                "15%",

                "To test the client's psychological limit for high-calorie intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse dieting involves slowly adding 50-100 calories per week to 'walk' the metabolism back up, allowing the body to adapt to higher intake without the rapid fat storage associated with immediate surplus."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data from the NWCR indicates that 78% of people who successfully maintain a 30lb+ weight loss for over a year eat breakfast daily, which is thought to help regulate appetite throughout the day."

                "Completing a 48-hour fast without significant distress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Graduation focuses on 'Off-boarding,' where the client moves away from external tools like apps and scales toward internal 'Interoceptive Awareness' to maintain their weight intuitively."

            "id": "q13_10",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Thermogenesis is the process where the body becomes more efficient, lowering the metabolic rate beyond what is predicted by the loss of body mass alone to defend the 'set point.'"
