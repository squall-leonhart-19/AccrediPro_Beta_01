            "question": "According to meta-analyses on thermogenic stimulants, caffeine has been shown to increase Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) by what percentage range?",
            "options": ["1-2%", "3-11%", "15-20%", "25-30%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that caffeine can acutely increase RMR by 3-11%, though this effect often diminishes with chronic use due to tolerance."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client is taking a GLP-1 agonist (e.g., Semaglutide). What is the primary nutritional priority a coach should address to prevent the loss of Lean Body Mass (LBM)?",
            "options": ["Increasing simple carbohydrate intake for energy", "Intermittent fasting to enhance drug efficacy", "Prioritizing protein intake (1.2-1.5g/kg) and resistance training", "Eliminating all dietary fats to prevent nausea"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 medications can lead to significant muscle loss alongside fat loss; maintaining high protein intake and resistance training is critical to preserve metabolic health."

            "question": "The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recognizes which natural fiber as having a substantiated claim for contributing to weight loss in the context of an energy-restricted diet?",
            "options": ["Psyllium Husk", "Inulin", "Glucomannan", "Apple Pectin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucomannan is one of the few supplements with an EFSA-approved health claim for weight loss, provided it is taken in doses of 3g/day with plenty of water."

            "options": ["Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055", "Bifidobacterium longum", "Lactobacillus acidophilus", "Saccharomyces boulardii"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 has specific clinical evidence showing significant reductions in visceral fat and BMI compared to placebo groups."

            "question": "Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), how does the FDA regulate supplements compared to pharmaceutical drugs?",
            "options": ["Supplements must be proven safe and effective before reaching the market", "The FDA treats supplements as food, meaning they are not 'approved' for safety or efficacy before sale", "Supplements are regulated more strictly than over-the-counter medications", "Manufacturers must submit clinical trial data to the FDA 2 years prior to launch"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DSHEA classifies supplements as food, placing the burden of proof on the FDA to show a product is 'unsafe' rather than the manufacturer proving it is safe/effective before sale."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term Metformin use is clinically associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency due to interference with absorption in the distal ileum."

            "question": "What is the primary mechanism of action for GLP-1 receptor agonists in facilitating weight loss?",
            "options": ["Increasing body temperature through thermogenesis", "Blocking the absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine", "Slowing gastric emptying and increasing satiety signals in the brain", "Directly dissolving adipose tissue through lipolysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 agonists mimic incretin hormones that slow gastric emptying and act on the hypothalamus to decrease appetite and increase the feeling of fullness."

            "question": "When a coach identifies a potential 'red flag' interaction between a client's supplement and a prescribed medication, what is the appropriate professional action?",
            "options": ["Tell the client to stop taking the medication immediately", "Suggest a different supplement that doesn't interact", "Provide a written summary of the concern and refer the client to their prescribing physician or pharmacist", "Ignore it, as supplements are natural and cannot interfere with drugs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within their scope of practice by identifying risks but deferring all medical/medication decisions to licensed healthcare professionals."
