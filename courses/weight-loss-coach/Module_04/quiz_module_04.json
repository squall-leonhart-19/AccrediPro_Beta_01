            "question": "Which satiety hormone is primarily secreted by the L-cells of the ileum and colon in response to food intake, specifically acting to inhibit gastric emptying via the 'ileal brake'?",
            "options": [
                "Ghrelin",
                "Peptide YY (PYY)",
                "Leptin",
                "Adiponectin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peptide YY (PYY) is released postprandially from the distal GI tract and is a key mediator of the ileal brake, which slows down digestion to increase nutrient absorption and promote satiety."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the Protein Leverage Hypothesis (Simpson & Raubenheimer), what occurs when the percentage of protein in the diet decreases?",
            "options": [
                "Total energy intake decreases as the body enters a protein-sparing state.",
                "Total energy intake remains stable while metabolic rate increases.",
                "Total energy intake increases as the body drives the consumption of fats and carbs to reach a protein target.",
                "The body begins to break down muscle tissue immediately to maintain blood amino acid levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis suggests that humans have a strong biological drive to consume a fixed amount of protein; if the diet is protein-dilute, we over-consume fats and carbohydrates to meet that protein requirement."

            "question": "A client is struggling with hunger despite hitting their calorie goals. You observe they eat 100g of dried dates (280 kcal) as a snack. Replacing this with 500g of fresh strawberries (approx. 160 kcal) is an application of which principle?",
            "options": [
                "The Micronutrient Spark Plug Theory",
                "Sensory-Specific Satiety",
                "Caloric Density vs. Nutrient Density",
                "The Cephalic Phase Response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a 'Volumetrics' approach, swapping a high-caloric-density food (dried fruit) for a low-caloric-density food (fresh fruit) to increase gastric distension and satiety with fewer calories."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which specific micronutrient is highlighted as a 'Metabolic Spark Plug' due to its role as a cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions, including the activation of ATP?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is essential for the stability and activation of ATP (adenosine triphosphate); without it, the 'energy currency' of the cell cannot be used effectively for metabolic processes."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "What is the primary psychological mechanism behind the 'buffet effect,' where individuals consume significantly more calories when presented with a wide variety of flavors?",
            "options": [
                "Sensory-Specific Satiety",
                "The Anabolic Window",

                "Hyperpalatability Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory-Specific Satiety refers to the decline in pleasure derived from a specific food as it is consumed. A wide variety of flavors 'resets' this pleasure, delaying the signal to stop eating."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "On the 1–10 Hunger-Satiety Scale, which range is considered the 'Optimal Performance Zone' for stopping a meal to ensure the client is satisfied but not lethargic?",
            "options": [
                "Level 3–4 (Strong hunger)",
                "Level 5 (Neutral)",
                "Level 6–7 (Comfortably full/Satisfied)",
                "Level 9–10 (Stuffed/Painfully full)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stopping at level 6 or 7 allows the brain to catch up with the stomach's signals (which can take 20 minutes) and prevents the metabolic 'slump' associated with overeating."

            "options": [
                "Insoluble fiber (e.g., wheat bran)",
                "Soluble, viscous fiber (e.g., beta-glucan in oats)",
                "Resistant starch (e.g., cold potatoes)",
                "Lignin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soluble, viscous fibers form a gel-like substance in the gut, which slows gastric emptying and the rate of nutrient absorption, leading to more stable blood sugar and prolonged satiety."

                "25% of the plate",
                "50% of the plate",
                "75% of the plate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AccrediPro 'Nourished Plate' recommends 50% non-starchy vegetables to provide high volume (satiety) and high micronutrient density with very low caloric load."

            "question": "Research on the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) shows that protein requires significantly more energy to process than other macros. What is the typical TEF range for protein?",
            "options": [
                "0–3%",
                "5–10%",
                "20–30%",
                "40–50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has the highest TEF (20-30%), meaning that for every 100 calories of protein consumed, the body uses 20-30 calories just to digest, absorb, and process the amino acids."

                "Hypoglycemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is often referred to as the 'dessert stomach.' While the body is physiologically satiated by savory flavors, the reward centers of the brain remain 'hungry' for a new sensory experience (sweetness)."
