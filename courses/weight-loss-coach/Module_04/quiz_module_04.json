            "question": "In a typical sedentary individual, which component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) accounts for the largest percentage (approximately 60-75%) of total calories burned?",
            "options": [
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)",
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)",
                "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) represents the energy required to maintain vital organ function at rest and constitutes the majority of TDEE for most people."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which macronutrient has the highest Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), requiring approximately 20-30% of its caloric value to be processed?",

                "Alcohol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has the highest thermic effect (20-30%), compared to carbohydrates (5-10%) and fats (0-3%), due to the complex metabolic process of deamination and urea synthesis."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Research by Dr. James Levine suggests that the variance in Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) between two people of similar size can account for a difference of up to how many calories per day?",
            "options": [
                "200 kcal",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "NEAT is highly variable; differences in daily movement (pacing, standing, fidgeting) can lead to a variance of up to 2,000 kcal per day between individuals."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In the landmark 2012 overfeeding study by Bray et al., what was the primary finding regarding the high-protein group (25% protein) compared to the low-protein group (5% protein)?",
            "options": [
                "The high-protein group gained more body fat.",
                "The high-protein group saw a significant increase in resting energy expenditure and lean body mass.",
                "Both groups gained the exact same amount of body fat because calories were equal.",
                "The low-protein group burned more calories through NEAT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Despite equal calorie surpluses, the high-protein group stored less of the excess as fat and saw an increase in resting metabolic rate and lean mass compared to the low-protein group."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "UCP1 (also known as thermogenin) allows protons to leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, bypassing ATP synthesis and dissipating energy as heat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium-dependent enzymes (deiodinases) are responsible for converting T4 into the active T3 hormone, which regulates metabolic rate."

                "Only observed in individuals with a BMI over 35.",
                "Permanent and cannot be reversed by diet breaks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis represents a 'metabolic efficiency' where the body burns fewer calories than expected based on its new, lower body mass to defend against further weight loss."
        },

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "The 'Active Couch Potato' phenomenon refers to individuals who exercise for 30-60 minutes daily but remain sedentary for the rest of the day. Research indicates this lifestyle can lead to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged sitting suppresses LPL activity, which is necessary for clearing fats from the bloodstream, an effect that an hour of exercise may not fully offset."

            "question": "According to the study by Barr and Wright (2010), how did the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) compare between a whole-food meal (multi-grain bread and cheddar cheese) and a processed-food meal (white bread and processed cheese) of identical macronutrients?",
            "options": [
                "There was no measurable difference.",
                "The processed meal had a 10% higher TEF.",
                "The whole-food meal resulted in a nearly 50% higher energy expenditure post-consumption.",
                "The whole-food meal only increased TEF in athletes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The whole-food meal required significantly more energy to digest, resulting in a nearly 50% higher thermic response compared to the highly processed meal."

            "options": [
                "Reducing protein intake to 0.5g per kg of body weight.",
                "Increasing the caloric deficit to 40% or more.",
                "Implementing periodic 'Refeeds' or diet breaks at maintenance calories.",
                "Eliminating all forms of resistance training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Periodic increases in calories (specifically carbohydrates) can temporarily boost leptin and T3 levels, helping to signal to the brain that the 'famine' is over and reducing adaptive thermogenesis."
