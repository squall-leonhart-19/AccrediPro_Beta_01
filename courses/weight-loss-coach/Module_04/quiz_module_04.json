            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which hormone, primarily secreted by the oxyntic cells of the stomach, acts as a potent orexigenic signal that peaks immediately before meals?",
            "options": [
                "Ghrelin",
                "Leptin",
                "Peptide YY (PYY)",
                "Cholecystokinin (CCK)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ghrelin is known as the 'hunger hormone' and is the only known peripherally active orexigenic peptide. Its levels rise sharply before meals and drop after eating."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of Caloric Density, which of the following food categories typically falls within the 'High Satiety/Low Density' range of 0.0 to 0.6 kcal/gram?",
            "options": [
                "Whole grains and legumes",
                "Lean meats and poultry",
                "Non-starchy vegetables and most fruits",
                "Nuts, seeds, and oils"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-starchy vegetables and fruits have high water and fiber content, resulting in very low caloric density (usually 0.1 to 0.5 kcal/g), allowing for high volume consumption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis (Simpson & Raubenheimer) suggests that the body will continue to drive hunger until which of the following occurs?",
            "options": [
                "The stomach reaches a specific physical stretch volume",
                "A specific absolute target of protein mass is consumed",
                "Blood glucose levels reach a state of hyperglycemia",
                "Total caloric requirements for the day are exceeded by 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hypothesis posits that the drive for protein is so strong that humans will overconsume fats and carbohydrates (energy) in order to reach a specific protein intake target."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism of the 'Ileal Brake' in the context of the gastric brake system?",
            "options": [
                "The physical stretching of the stomach walls during mastication",
                "The rapid release of insulin in response to cephalic phase signals",
                "The slowing of gastric emptying when undigested nutrients reach the distal small intestine",
                "The inhibition of salivary amylase by acidic gastric juices"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ileal Brake is a feedback mechanism where the presence of undigested nutrients (especially fats and fiber) in the ileum triggers hormones like GLP-1 and PYY to slow gastric emptying, increasing satiety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which micronutrient, often referred to as a 'Metabolic Spark Plug,' is a mandatory cofactor for over 300 biochemical reactions, including the activation of ATP and insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is essential for energy metabolism; without it, ATP cannot be biologically active, and insulin receptors cannot function optimally, leading to metabolic inefficiency."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "How does 'Sensory-Specific Satiety' explain why individuals often find room for dessert even after a large, savory meal?",
            "options": [
                "Dessert contains higher caloric density which overrides the vagus nerve",
                "The body requires sugar to process the proteins from the main meal",
                "Satiety is specific to a flavor profile; the appetite for a new taste remains high even when full of another",
                "The 'dessert stomach' is a physiological expansion of the fundus caused by glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory-Specific Satiety is the decline in pleasantness of a specific food as it is consumed, while the palatability of foods with different sensory profiles (e.g., sweet after salty) remains high."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When using the 1-10 Hunger-Satiety Scale, which number represents the 'Optimal Exit Point' where a client feels satisfied but not physically stuffed?",
            "options": [
                "Level 3",
                "Level 5",
                "Level 7",
                "Level 10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Level 7 is the goal: 'Satisfied and comfortable.' Stopping here prevents the discomfort and metabolic 'slump' associated with Level 8-10 (Full/Stuffed/Sick)."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the 'Nourished Plate' design, what is the recommended ratio for non-starchy vegetables to optimize both micronutrient intake and gastric volume?",
            "options": [
                "10% of the plate",
                "25% of the plate",
                "50% of the plate",
                "75% of the plate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Filling 50% of the plate with non-starchy vegetables ensures high nutrient density and high volume (gastric stretch) with very low caloric impact."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis on fiber intake suggested that for every 10g increase in daily fiber, the risk of all-cause mortality decreased by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "2%",
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "25%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Large-scale meta-analyses consistently show that a 10g increase in fiber correlates with a roughly 10% reduction in the risk of several chronic diseases and all-cause mortality."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'constant hunger' despite eating 2,500 calories a day. Their diet is high in ultra-processed fats and refined sugars, but low in fiber (12g/day) and protein (10% of calories). Which intervention addresses the physiological root of their hunger?",
            "options": [
                "Reducing total calories to 1,500 immediately",
                "Increasing protein to 25-30% and fiber to 30g+ to trigger the protein leverage and gastric brake mechanisms",
                "Adding a high-intensity cardio session to blunt appetite through adrenaline",
                "Switching to an all-liquid diet to bypass the need for mastication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This client is suffering from 'hidden hunger' and low satiety signaling. Increasing protein (Protein Leverage) and fiber (Gastric/Ileal Brake) will physiologically suppress hunger at the hormonal level."
