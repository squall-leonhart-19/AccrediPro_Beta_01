        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the METRIC Method™, what is the primary physiological objective of 'Metabolic Flexibility'?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the amount of glucose stored in muscle tissue.",
                "To train the mitochondria to efficiently switch between oxidizing glucose and fatty acids.",
                "To ensure the client remains in a state of ketosis indefinitely.",
                "To increase the speed of gastric emptying."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Flexibility (the 'M' in METRIC) focuses on mitochondrial health, allowing the body to transition seamlessly between fuel sources based on availability and demand, preventing energy crashes and facilitating fat oxidation."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client experiences intense 'hedonic hunger' triggered by work stress. According to the 'Emotional Regulation' pillar, which hormonal axis is the primary target for intervention?",
            "options": [
                "The HPT (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid) axis.",
                "The HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) axis and cortisol regulation.",

                "The GH-IGF1 axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional Regulation ('E') focuses on managing the stress-response system (HPA axis). Chronic cortisol elevation triggers the reward centers of the brain, leading to hedonic hunger (eating for pleasure rather than energy)."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "Under 'Thermic Optimization' (T), which macronutrient has the highest Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and what percentage of its energy is typically used for digestion?",
            "options": [
                "Fats; 0-3%",
                "Carbohydrates; 5-10%",

                "Fiber; 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has the highest TEF, requiring 20-30% of its caloric value to be processed. This is a key lever in the METRIC Method to maintain a higher metabolic rate during weight loss."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "Why does the 'Resistance & Recovery' (R) pillar prioritize lean muscle preservation during a caloric deficit?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the body's requirement for dietary fat.",
                "To prevent 'metabolic adaptation' and maintain a higher Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR).",

                "To reduce the need for micronutrient supplementation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Preserving muscle mass via resistance training prevents the significant drop in RMR often seen in 'starvation responses,' ensuring long-term weight maintenance and metabolic health."

                "Focusing exclusively on liquid nutrition for better absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intake Precision uses data-driven partitioning to ensure the client is fueled for their specific activity level while prioritizing high-satiety, nutrient-dense foods."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human physiology is evolved to process nutrients more efficiently during daylight. Insulin sensitivity peaks earlier in the day and declines as melatonin rises in the evening."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High waist-to-hip ratios are clinical indicators of visceral fat, which is metabolically active and inflammatory, necessitating the implementation of the METRIC Method's metabolic pillars."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational Interviewing is a client-centered coaching style that helps clients explore and resolve their own resistance to change, fostering autonomy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic adaptation is the body's survival mechanism where it slows down metabolic processes more than expected based on the new, smaller body size to defend against further weight loss."

            "options": [
                "It has no effect as long as calories are the same.",
                "It increases fat loss by keeping the body in a stressed state.",
                "It can reduce the proportion of weight lost as fat by up to 55%.",
