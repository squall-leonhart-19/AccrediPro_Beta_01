            "question": "According to the Circadian Biology lesson, which specific region of the hypothalamus acts as the 'Master Clock' by receiving light signals via the retinohypothalamic tract?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Nucleus",
                "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)",

                "The Anterior Pituitary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) is the master pacemaker that synchronizes peripheral clocks in the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue based on light-dark cycles."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A 2004 study by Spiegel et al. demonstrated that restricting sleep to 4 hours for just two nights resulted in which specific hormonal shift?",
            "options": [
                "A 10% increase in leptin and 10% decrease in ghrelin",
                "An 18% decrease in leptin and a 24% increase in ghrelin",

                "No significant change in appetite-regulating hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows short sleep duration leads to an 18% reduction in leptin (the satiety hormone) and a 24% increase in ghrelin (the hunger hormone), significantly increasing caloric cravings."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Chronic elevation of cortisol promotes visceral adiposity primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "By inhibiting the enzyme Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL)",
                "By increasing the density of glucocorticoid receptors in abdominal fat compared to subcutaneous fat",
                "By decreasing the production of insulin in the pancreas",
                "By stimulating the thyroid to increase metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visceral fat has a higher density of glucocorticoid receptors; cortisol activates Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) in these cells, leading to preferential fat storage in the midsection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obesogens are chemical agents that disrupt metabolic signaling, often by activating PPAR-gamma, which stimulates the development of new fat cells (adipogenesis)."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Research on Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) indicates that the variance in energy expenditure between two people of similar size can be as high as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NEAT is the most variable component of TDEE. Differences in daily movement (standing, pacing, fidgeting) can account for a variance of up to 2,000 kcal per day."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In the context of Chrononutrition, why is a high-calorie meal consumed in the evening (20:00) more 'obesogenic' than the same meal consumed in the morning (08:00)?",
            "options": [
                "Digestive enzymes are only produced in the morning",
                "Dietary Induced Thermogenesis (DIT) is significantly lower in the evening, and insulin sensitivity decreases as the day progresses",
                "The body cannot absorb protein after sunset",
                "Calories have higher energy density at night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to circadian rhythms, insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food (DIT) are highest in the morning and lowest in the evening, leading to higher glucose excursions at night."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "A client presents with high perceived stress, 5 hours of sleep per night, and a plateau in weight loss despite a 500-calorie deficit. What is the most likely physiological 'blocker'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol from stress and sleep deprivation can cause 'leaky' insulin signaling and promote fat storage even in a theoretical caloric deficit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning sunlight exposure is the primary zeitgeber (time-giver) that anchors the SCN, regulates the evening melatonin release, and stabilizes metabolic rate."
