            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), known as the 'Master Clock,' is primarily synchronized by which environmental cue?",
            "options": [
                "Ambient temperature changes",
                "Food intake and macronutrient ratios",
                "Blue light wavelengths (approx. 460-480nm) hitting melanopsin cells",
                "Physical activity and muscle contraction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While peripheral clocks respond to food and exercise, the SCN is primarily entrained by light-dark cycles, specifically blue light detected by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) containing melanopsin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to research on evening blue light exposure (e.g., Cheung et al., 2016), how does blue light exposure during the evening hours affect metabolic function?",
            "options": [
                "It increases insulin sensitivity by 10%",
                "It significantly increases insulin resistance and elevates peak glucose levels",
                "It has no measurable effect on glucose metabolism if sleep duration is 8 hours",
                "It enhances the thermic effect of food (TEF) for the subsequent meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exposure to blue-enriched light in the evening has been shown to increase insulin resistance and result in higher peak glucose levels compared to dim light exposure, even when sleep duration is controlled."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A client is practicing Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) with a window of 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM. What is a primary metabolic advantage of this specific timing over a later window (e.g., 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM)?",
            "options": [
                "Higher muscle protein synthesis at night",
                "Greater alignment with the natural circadian peak of insulin sensitivity",
                "Complete suppression of cortisol throughout the day",
                "Elimination of the need for caloric tracking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are naturally higher in the morning. eTRF aligns food intake with this metabolic peak, leading to better glucose control and lipid metabolism."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Night shift workers face a 40% higher risk of metabolic syndrome. What is the primary hormonal driver for the increased caloric intake observed in this population?",
            "options": [
                "Suppressed ghrelin and elevated leptin",
                "Elevated ghrelin and suppressed leptin levels",
                "Decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) only",
                "Excessive melatonin production during the shift"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian misalignment from night shifts leads to an increase in the hunger hormone ghrelin and a decrease in the satiety hormone leptin, often resulting in an average surplus of 200-300 calories per day."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Why is it metabolically risky to consume a high-carbohydrate meal late at night when melatonin levels are rising?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin binds to MT1 receptors in the pancreas, inhibiting insulin secretion",
                "Melatonin causes immediate fat storage regardless of calorie intake",
                "Melatonin increases the glycemic index of all foods by 50%",
                "Melatonin prevents the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors (MTNR1B) are present in the pancreatic beta cells. When melatonin is high, it inhibits insulin secretion to prevent hypoglycemia during sleep, making the body less equipped to handle glucose at night."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 regarding seasonal variations, which phenomenon is most likely to contribute to 'winter weight gain' in northern latitudes?",
            "options": [
                "A natural increase in Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) during cold months",
                "Decreased insulin sensitivity due to reduced Vitamin D and shorter photoperiods",
                "Hyper-hydration leading to water weight retention",
                "A decrease in the hormone ghrelin during winter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reduced sun exposure leads to lower Vitamin D levels and shorter photoperiods, which can negatively impact insulin sensitivity and mood, often leading to increased 'hibernation' behaviors and carbohydrate cravings."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "To optimize the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) for metabolic priming, what is the recommended morning protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Staying in a dark room for 2 hours after waking",

                "Performing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 4:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bright light exposure shortly after waking strengthens the CAR, which helps regulate the circadian rhythm for the rest of the day, improves alertness, and sets the stage for evening melatonin production."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "The 'Forbidden Zone' for sleep refers to which circadian period?",
            "options": [
                "The 2-3 hours after eating a large meal",
                "The 1-2 hours of maximum circadian alertness just before biological sunset",
                "The period between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM",
                "The time spent in REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Forbidden Zone' or 'Wake Maintenance Zone' is a period of high alertness driven by the circadian system to keep us awake just before the homeostatic sleep pressure and melatonin take over."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client reports significant 'midnight snacking.' Based on Lesson 8, which intervention would best manage the nocturnal cortisol spikes causing this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing caffeine intake in the afternoon to stay alert",
                "A 10-minute evening wind-down protocol involving box breathing or NSDR",

                "Using a high-wattage blue light bulb in the kitchen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Managing evening stress through Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NSDR) or breathing exercises lowers cortisol, which reduces the likelihood of stress-induced nocturnal eating and improves sleep architecture."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Growth Hormone (GH) is essential for fat mobilization. When does the largest pulse of GH secretion typically occur in a healthy individual?",
            "options": [
                "During the first 90 minutes of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS)",
                "Immediately after a high-carbohydrate breakfast",
                "During the final REM cycle before waking",
                "At 12:00 PM (noon) regardless of sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The largest daily pulse of Growth Hormone occurs during the first half of the night during deep, slow-wave sleep. Disrupting this phase through late-night blue light or alcohol significantly impairs fat loss potential."
