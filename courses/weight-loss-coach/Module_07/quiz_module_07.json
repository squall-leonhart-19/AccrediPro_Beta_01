            "question": "Which structure in the hypothalamus serves as the master 'pacemaker' for circadian rhythms, coordinating peripheral clocks in the liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue?",
            "options": [
                "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)",
                "The Pineal Gland",
                "The Anterior Pituitary",
                "The Ventromedial Nucleus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The SCN is the master circadian clock that synchronizes all peripheral tissues to the 24-hour light/dark cycle via hormonal and neural signals."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In a landmark study by Spiegel et al. (2004), restricting sleep to 4 hours for just two nights resulted in which specific hormonal shift?",
            "options": [
                "A 10% increase in leptin and 10% decrease in ghrelin",
                "An 18% decrease in leptin and a 28% increase in ghrelin",
                "A 50% increase in insulin sensitivity",
                "No significant change in hunger hormones, only an increase in cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short sleep duration significantly suppresses leptin (satiety) and elevates ghrelin (hunger), creating a biological drive for overconsumption, particularly of calorie-dense foods."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Chronic elevation of cortisol promotes visceral adiposity (belly fat) primarily through which physiological mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Why does 'Early Time-Restricted Feeding' (eTRF), where the eating window ends by 3:00 PM or 4:00 PM, typically result in better metabolic outcomes than late-window feeding?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human metabolic processes, including insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, are naturally higher in the morning and decline as the biological night approaches."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA and Phthalates are endocrine disruptors that can activate PPAR-gamma, the master regulator of fat cell formation, leading to increased fat storage capacity."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a glucose-mobilizing hormone; chronic elevation keeps blood sugar and insulin higher than normal, which inhibits lipolysis (fat burning)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low-angle sunlight (morning sun) provides the specific light frequency (lux and color) required to signal the SCN to start the biological day and set the timer for evening melatonin production."
