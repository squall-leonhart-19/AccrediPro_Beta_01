            "question": "The transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5-TR represented a paradigm shift in diagnosis. Which of the following best describes this change?",
            "options": [
                "The separation of Asperger’s Syndrome into a distinct genetic category.",
                "The merging of Autistic Disorder, Asperger’s Disorder, and PDD-NOS into a single 'Autism Spectrum Disorder' (ASD) diagnosis.",
                "The removal of sensory processing issues as a diagnostic criterion.",
                "The requirement that symptoms must be fully manifest before the age of 2 years."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5 replaced the previous distinct subcategories (Asperger's, PDD-NOS, etc.) with a single umbrella diagnosis of ASD, recognizing that these conditions represent a spectrum of the same underlying neurodevelopmental profile."

            "question": "Current neurobiological research into 'Brain Connectivity' in autistic individuals frequently identifies which specific pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Global over-connectivity across all brain regions.",
                "Increased long-range connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum.",
                "A pattern of local over-connectivity (short-range) and long-range under-connectivity.",
                "A complete absence of activity in the amygdala during social processing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroimaging studies often show 'local over-connectivity,' which may explain specialized skills or sensory hypersensitivity, and 'long-range under-connectivity,' which can impact the integration of complex information across different brain regions."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In the context of Sensory Processing (Lesson 3), what is the primary role of 'Sensory Gating'?",
            "options": [
                "The physical ability to close one's eyes or ears to avoid stimuli.",
                "A neurological process where the brain filters out redundant or unnecessary stimuli to prevent cognitive overload.",
                "The voluntary decision to focus on a specific task despite background noise.",
                "A method used by practitioners to limit the amount of equipment in a therapy room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory gating is an automatic neurological mechanism (often involving the thalamus) that filters out 'background noise.' In many autistic individuals, this gating is less efficient, leading to sensory flooding."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which cognitive theory explains the tendency of some autistic individuals to focus on minor details while struggling to grasp the 'big picture' or overall context?",

                "Weak Central Coherence (WCC)",

                "The Intense World Theory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weak Central Coherence theory suggests that autistic individuals have a detail-focused cognitive style, which provides advantages in local processing but can make global integration (the 'big picture') more challenging."

            "id": "q1_5",

                "Non-autistic people have superior empathy that autistic people must learn to mimic.",
                "Empathy is a fixed trait that cannot be improved through support."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication issues are not just an 'autistic deficit' but a result of a mismatch in social reality and communication styles between autistic and non-autistic individuals."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Autism Plus' framework (Lesson 6), what percentage of autistic individuals are estimated to have at least one co-occurring mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that a high majority (70-80%) of autistic individuals meet the criteria for at least one co-occurring mental health condition, necessitating the 'Autism Plus' holistic approach."

                "The M-CHAT is a gold-standard diagnostic tool, while the ADOS-2 is a short screening questionnaire.",
                "The M-CHAT is a screening tool used to identify risk in toddlers, while the ADOS-2 is a semi-structured clinical observation used for diagnosis.",
                "The ADOS-2 is only used for adults, while the M-CHAT is used for all ages.",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable tools."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The M-CHAT (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers) is a brief screening tool to identify those who need further evaluation. The ADOS-2 is a comprehensive, observational diagnostic instrument."

            "options": [
                "A medical pathology that requires a cure.",
                "A behavioral disorder caused by environmental toxins.",

                "A temporary developmental delay that resolves with intensive therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The neurodiversity paradigm shifts the focus from 'pathology' to 'diversity,' viewing autism as a different way of being that is a natural part of human variation."

                "Prioritizing the goals of the parents or caregivers over the client's preferences.",

                "Ensuring the client has 'Assent' and is an active participant in their own support plan.",
                "Using the same intervention for every client regardless of their sensory profile."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical, person-centered support requires obtaining assent (the client's agreement to participate) and ensuring the individual is the central agent in their own life and support goals."
