            "question": "According to the 'Double Empathy Problem' theory proposed by Damian Milton, social communication breakdowns between L1 autistic individuals and neurotypical peers are primarily caused by:",
            "options": [
                "A deficit in the autistic individual's Theory of Mind",
                "A mutual mismatch in communication styles and experiences between both parties",
                "The autistic individual's inability to process subtext and sarcasm",
                "Neurological delays in the prefrontal cortex during social interaction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication issues are a two-way street where both neurotypical and autistic individuals struggle to understand each other's perspectives, rather than a one-sided deficit."

            "question": "In the context of Executive Functioning (L2), 'Autistic Inertia' is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A physical lack of movement due to motor planning issues",
                "A refusal to participate in non-preferred tasks",
                "Significant difficulty in initiating a task or transitioning/stopping a task once started",
                "The tendency to repeat the same movement or phrase (perseveration)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autistic inertia involves a 'friction' in starting tasks (initiation) or stopping them once the individual has entered a state of flow or hyperfocus."

            "id": "q10_3",

            "options": [
                "The shift from IDEA (entitlement) to ADA/Section 504 (eligibility), where the student must self-disclose",
                "The removal of all academic accommodations once a student turns 18",
                "The requirement that parents must sign off on all curriculum changes",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unlike K-12 (IDEA), where schools are responsible for identifying needs, in Higher Ed (ADA), the burden shifts to the student to self-disclose and request specific accommodations."

            "question": "Research on workplace disclosure (L4) suggests that 'Selective Disclosure' is often the most effective strategy. This involves:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selective disclosure focuses on the 'workplace adjustments' or 'working style' (e.g., 'I work best with written instructions') rather than leading with a clinical diagnosis, which can reduce initial stigma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing means the individual processes every detail individually before forming a whole picture, which can lead to missing the 'big picture' or emotional subtext of a social exchange."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Raymaker et al. (2020) identified 'Autistic Burnout' as a distinct clinical phenomenon. What is a primary differentiator between Autistic Burnout and Clinical Depression?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout does not involve feelings of sadness",
                "Depression is caused by light sensitivity, while burnout is not",

                "Burnout only lasts for 24-48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While they share symptoms, Autistic Burnout specifically involves a 'regression' in skills (like executive function or speech) and a heightened sensitivity to sensory input due to chronic masking."

                "It is illegal in professional environments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While scripting provides a safety net, it can lead to 'social brittleness' where the individual becomes stuck or anxious if the peer responds in an unexpected way."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interdependence recognizes that no one is truly 'independent' and encourages building a network where the autistic adult contributes their strengths while receiving support for their challenges."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body doubling is a common EF strategy for L1 adults/ADHDers where the presence of another person helps ground the individual and maintain focus on the task at hand."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The loss of activities of daily living (cooking/emails) combined with increased sensory sensitivity (itchy clothes) are hallmark signs of the nervous system being overwhelmed by burnout."
