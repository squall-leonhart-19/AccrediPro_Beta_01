            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Why is the term 'High-Functioning' increasingly rejected by the autistic community and clinical experts in Level 1 ASD support?",
            "options": [
                "It implies that the individual does not require any support services.",
                "It focuses on cognitive ability while ignoring the high internal cost of adaptation and support needs in other areas.",
                "It suggests the individual has no sensory processing challenges.",
                "It is a diagnostic term that was removed from the DSM-5 in 2013."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'High-Functioning' label is problematic because it prioritizes IQ over functional support needs. Many Level 1 individuals experience significant challenges in executive functioning and sensory processing that are 'hidden' by their cognitive abilities."
        },

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A client is struggling to understand 'office politics' and the unwritten expectations of their new job. This is a failure to navigate which concept?",
            "options": [
                "The Sensory Profile",
                "The Hidden Curriculum",
                "Cognitive Flexibility",
                "The Theory of Mind Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hidden Curriculum refers to the set of unwritten, unspoken social rules and expectations that neurotypical individuals often pick up intuitively but must be explicitly taught to those with ASD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "The 'Inconsistent Performer' phenomenon in Level 1 ASD is most frequently attributed to deficits in which area?",
            "options": [
                "General Intelligence (IQ)",
                "Social Motivation",
                "Executive Functioning",
                "Long-term Memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inconsistency—such as being able to solve complex calculus but struggling to remember to brush teeth or organize a desk—is a hallmark of Executive Functioning (EF) challenges, not a lack of intelligence or effort."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "According to research on 'Camouflaging' (Masking), what is the primary long-term risk for Level 1 individuals who consistently mask their traits?",

                "Improved social standing and career longevity",
                "A permanent increase in social IQ",

                "Development of Narcissistic Personality Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those using the CAT-Q (Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire), show a strong correlation between high levels of masking and severe mental health outcomes, including exhaustion and suicidal ideation."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Damian Milton’s 'Double Empathy Problem' suggests that social communication breakdowns in ASD are caused by:",
            "options": [
                "A biological inability of autistic people to feel empathy.",
                "A mutual misunderstanding between two different neurotypes (autistic and neurotypical).",

                "Sensory overload during social interactions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication issues are a 'two-way street.' Autistic people understand other autistic people well, but there is a reciprocal lack of understanding between autistic and neurotypical individuals."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Statistics regarding vocational outcomes for Level 1 autistic adults show that approximately what percentage are underemployed or unemployed despite having college degrees?",

                "15-20%",
                "35-40%",

            "options": [
                "Burnout is caused by sensory and social overload and is characterized by a loss of previously mastered skills.",
                "Burnout does not involve feelings of sadness or hopelessness.",
                "Depression requires medication, whereas burnout only requires a vacation.",
                "There is no clinical difference; they are the same condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Autistic Burnout is distinct because it often involves 'skill regression' (losing the ability to perform tasks one could previously do) and is specifically triggered by the cumulative load of masking and sensory environment."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the context of self-advocacy, what is the 'Disclosure Dilemma' faced by Level 1 adults in the workplace?",
            "options": [
                "Whether to tell their parents about their diagnosis.",
                "The choice between seeking accommodations (risking stigma) or masking (risking burnout).",
                "Deciding which doctor to visit for a formal diagnosis.",
                "Choosing between a remote or in-person work environment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Disclosure Dilemma involves weighing the benefits of workplace accommodations against the potential risks of being stereotyped, passed over for promotions, or socially excluded once the diagnosis is known."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which Executive Functioning strategy involves a person working alongside the client to help them stay on task without necessarily providing direct instruction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body Doubling is a common EF support where the presence of another person helps the autistic individual maintain focus and initiate tasks that they might otherwise avoid."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client with Level 1 ASD experiences 'Monotropism.' How might this manifest in a vocational setting?",
            "options": [
                "The client is unable to speak to more than one person at a time.",
                "The client has an intense, hyper-focused interest that makes switching tasks difficult.",
                "The client requires a single, monochromatic workspace to avoid sensory overload.",
                "The client can only process information through one sensory modality (e.g., only visual)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monotropism is a theory of autism that suggests an 'atypical distribution of attention.' It manifests as an intense focus on a single interest or task, making transitions or multi-tasking significantly more difficult."
