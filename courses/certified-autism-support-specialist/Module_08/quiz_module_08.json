            "options": [
                "The student is no longer eligible for any accommodations under federal law.",
                "The responsibility shifts from the school district (IDEA) to the student (ADA/Section 504) to self-disclose and request accommodations.",
                "The college is required to follow the exact Individualized Education Program (IEP) developed in high school.",
                "The student's parents retain the legal right to negotiate accommodations with professors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In post-secondary settings, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) no longer applies. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504, the 'burden of proof' shifts to the student, who must proactively disclose their diagnosis and provide documentation to receive accommodations."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently indicates that approximately 85% of autistic college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, highlighting the 'employment gap' and the need for specialized career development and neurodiverse hiring initiatives."

            "question": "In the context of professional networking, what is the primary social function of 'small talk' that many Level 1 autistic individuals may find counter-intuitive?",
            "options": [
                "To exchange high-level technical data efficiently.",
                "To establish social safety and rapport before moving to deeper topics.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While often viewed as 'illogical' by neurodivergent individuals, small talk serves as a social 'handshake' to establish rapport, calibrate communication styles, and signal that one is a safe and cooperative social partner."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proposed by Damian Milton (2012), the Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns occur because both parties have different lived experiences and ways of processing the world, rather than the 'deficit' residing solely within the autistic person."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Burnout only occurs in children, while depression occurs in adults.",
                "Burnout is primarily characterized by the loss of previously mastered skills and reduced tolerance for sensory stimuli.",
                "Depression is treated with medication, while burnout has no known interventions.",
                "Burnout involves increased social seeking, whereas depression involves social withdrawal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While they can co-occur, Autistic Burnout is distinct from depression in its etiology (chronic masking and over-exertion) and its hallmark symptom: a significant, sometimes permanent, loss of functional skills and increased sensory sensitivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disclosure of Need focuses on the functional requirements of the individual (e.g., 'I work best in quiet environments') rather than the diagnostic label, which can sometimes be a safer or more effective strategy in professional settings."

                "Reframing 'rigidity' as 'consistency and high attention to detail.'",
                "Reframing 'lack of eye contact' as 'being too busy to look at people.'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Strength-based reframing involves identifying the functional benefit of a trait. Rigidity or a preference for routine translates professionally into reliability, consistency, and a high degree of accuracy in repetitive or complex tasks."

            "explanation": "The 'Service Cliff' refers to the dramatic drop-off in available supports (therapy, social work, educational assistance) that occurs when an individual turns 18 or 21 and leaves the K-12 education system, often leading to a crisis in independent living."
