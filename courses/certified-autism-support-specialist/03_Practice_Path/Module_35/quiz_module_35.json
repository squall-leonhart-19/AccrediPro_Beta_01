            "options": [
                "Growth implies adding revenue at the same rate as costs; Scaling implies adding revenue at a much faster rate than costs.",
                "Scaling refers only to physical expansion, while growth refers to digital expansion.",
                "Growth is for non-profits, while scaling is for-profit only.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are interchangeable in autism services."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Scaling is characterized by the ability to increase revenue without a proportional increase in resources or operational costs, whereas linear growth often requires a 1:1 increase in staff/costs for every new client."
