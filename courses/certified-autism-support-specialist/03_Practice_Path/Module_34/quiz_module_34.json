            "question": "According to Damian Milton’s (2012) 'Double Empathy Problem' discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary cause of social breakdown in neurodiverse groups?",
            "options": [
                "A biological deficit in the 'Theory of Mind' of the autistic participants.",
                "A mutual breakdown in understanding caused by differing dispositional outlooks and communication styles.",
                "The inability of neurotypical facilitators to use formal Social Stories.",
                "Sensory processing sensitivities that prevent group cohesion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that social difficulties are a two-way street; both neurotypical and autistic individuals may struggle to empathize with one another due to different lived experiences and communication styles."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'The Pause' is introduced as a facilitation technique. What is its primary purpose during a group conflict?",
            "options": [
                "To penalize the participant who is speaking too loudly.",
                "To allow the facilitator time to check their notes for the curriculum.",
                "To provide neurodivergent participants with the necessary processing time to regulate their nervous systems before responding.",
                "To signal the end of the workshop session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because many neurodivergent individuals require longer processing times or may experience delayed emotional responses, 'The Pause' prevents escalation by allowing the nervous system to return to a baseline state."

        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "When designing an Advanced Social Skills Training (SST) group (Lesson 3), research indicates that the 'Generalization Gap' is a major hurdle. What percentage of skills often fail to transfer to real-world settings without community-based practice?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Up to 30%",

                "Up to 70%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies on SST show that without ecological validity and practice in 'natural' settings, up to 70% of skills learned in a clinical group setting fail to generalize to the participant's daily life."

            "id": "q34_4",

            "options": [
                "Moving from a 'Compliance-Based' model to an 'Affirming-Advocacy' model.",
                "Increasing the number of hours the child spends in behavioral therapy.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Empowered advocacy focuses on understanding the child's neurobiology and advocating for their needs and rights, rather than forcing them to comply with neurotypical social norms."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "0 (represented as a T-score of 50)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In GAS, the 'expected outcome' is scored as 0. When converted to a standardized T-score, 50 represents the mean (expected) result."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "Strategic Leadership (Lesson 8) emphasizes 'Program Fidelity.' Why is this critical when scaling a workshop to multiple locations?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the program remains profitable.",
                "To ensure the intervention is delivered as designed so that outcomes remain consistent and evidence-based.",
                "To prevent the facilitators from adding their own personality to the sessions.",
                "To meet the requirements of the venue's insurance policy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fidelity ensures that the core components of the evidence-based practice are maintained, which is essential for achieving the same positive outcomes across different sites."

            "options": [
                "Gently encourage the participant to speak up so they don't lose the lesson.",
                "Increase the sensory input (brighter lights) to 'wake up' the participant's nervous system.",
                "Reduce environmental demands, offer a 'low-demand' exit, and provide a quiet space without requiring verbal communication.",
                "Direct the group to ignore the participant until they choose to rejoin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A shutdown is a physiological response to overwhelm. The facilitator should reduce demands and sensory input to allow the participant's nervous system to recover."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the PEERS® framework for social skills. What distinguishes this evidence-based program from traditional social skills groups?",

                "It is only for children under the age of 5.",
                "It requires a mandatory concurrent parent/caregiver training component to assist with 'social coaching' at home.",
                "It uses a reward system based on tokens and candy.",
                "It focuses on teaching autistic individuals how to 'mask' their traits more effectively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PEERS® model is highly effective because it trains parents/caregivers to act as social coaches, ensuring the skills are reinforced and generalized outside the group sessions."
