            "question": "According to Damian Milton’s 'Double Empathy Problem' (2012), where does the primary breakdown in communication occur?",
            "options": [
                "In the inherent social-cognitive deficits of the autistic individual",
                "In the lack of motivation for social interaction in neurodivergent populations",
                "In the bidirectional mismatch of experiences and expectations between neurotypes",
                "In the inability of autistic individuals to process non-verbal cues accurately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are a two-way street caused by a mismatch in communication styles and life experiences between autistic and allistic people, rather than a one-sided deficit."

            "question": "Research into 'Autistic Inertia' suggests that executive functioning challenges are often linked to which specific cognitive style?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-systemizing",
                "Monotropism (tunnels of attention)",
                "Weak Central Coherence",
                "Implicit Bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monotropism, or the tendency to focus intensely on a single interest or task, makes shifting attention (task switching) extremely difficult, leading to what is commonly described as inertia."

            "question": "A 2018 study by Cassidy et al. found that high levels of 'camouflaging' or masking were a significant independent risk factor for which of the following?",

                "Higher IQ scores in adulthood",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study highlighted that the chronic stress and exhaustion of masking are strongly correlated with higher rates of depression and suicidality among autistic adults."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alexithymia is a sub-clinical trait involving difficulty in identifying and describing one's own emotions, which often complicates traditional 'talk therapy' interventions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Cliff Edge' refers to the transition where individuals lose the legal protections and structured supports of the education system, often leading to high rates of unemployment."

            "id": "q4_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory gating is the brain's ability to filter out redundant or unnecessary stimuli. Many autistic individuals have reduced gating, meaning background noise is processed with the same intensity as a primary conversation."

                "Burnout is primarily characterized by a loss of skills and reduced sensory tolerance, whereas depression is primarily a mood disorder",
                "Depression requires medication, while burnout only requires a vacation",
                "Burnout only occurs in children, while depression only occurs in adults",
                "There is no difference; they are the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While they can co-occur, Autistic Burnout is specifically characterized by the loss of previously mastered functional skills and an acute increase in sensory sensitivities due to chronic over-exertion."

                "The refusal to interact with a partner unless a third party is present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel play allows for 'low-demand' connection, where individuals enjoy each other's presence without the exhausting requirements of continuous direct social interaction."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "When supporting a client in burnout recovery, which intervention is considered a 'Tier 1' priority according to recent neuro-affirming protocols?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovery from Autistic Burnout requires the reduction of demands (spoon theory management) and the removal of sensory triggers to allow the nervous system to regulate."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a specific example of 'Bottom-Up' processing common in many autistic individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Ignoring small details to understand the general 'gist' of a story",
                "Processing every individual sensory detail before forming a holistic concept of an environment",
                "Using social hierarchy to determine how to speak to someone",
                "Relying on past generalizations to predict future outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing involves taking in all the individual data points first. This leads to great attention to detail but can cause 'information overload' because the brain doesn't filter out 'unimportant' details automatically."
