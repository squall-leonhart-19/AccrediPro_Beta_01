            "question": "In the context of Multidisciplinary Synthesis (L1), what is the primary differentiator of a 'Transdisciplinary' approach compared to a 'Multidisciplinary' approach?",
            "options": [
                "Professionals work in parallel but do not share data.",
                "Team members blur professional boundaries to develop a shared conceptual framework and unified intervention plan.",
                "The medical doctor retains sole decision-making authority over all other therapists.",
                "Each therapist sets independent goals based strictly on their specific clinical domain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transdisciplinary synthesis involves transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries to create a holistic, unified support plan, whereas multidisciplinary work often involves professionals working in 'silos'."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, how does chronic sensory over-stimulation directly impact Executive Functioning (EF)?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the capacity of working memory by forcing the brain to process more data.",
                "It has no measurable effect on cognitive processes.",
                "It depletes the 'cognitive budget,' leading to reduced inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory over-stimulation acts as a 'drain' on cognitive resources. When a client is in a state of sensory distress, their prefrontal cortex has fewer resources available for executive tasks like emotional regulation and impulse control."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's discussion on Internal State Monitoring, what role does 'Interoceptive Awareness' play in behavioral synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to ignore external behaviors.",
                "It provides the client with the ability to sense internal physiological signals (e.g., heart rate) before a behavioral meltdown occurs.",
                "It is a diagnostic tool used only for identifying gastrointestinal issues.",
                "It is a cognitive strategy used to memorize social scripts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Improving interoceptive awareness helps clients identify the physiological precursors to dysregulation, allowing for proactive rather than reactive support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Services Cliff' describes the transition period into adulthood where many individuals lose access to the mandated supports provided by the education system, requiring a synthesized longitudinal plan to mitigate."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses and clinical data suggest that ADHD is the most common co-morbidity in ASD, with prevalence rates frequently cited between 30% and 80% depending on the diagnostic criteria used."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Low-Arousal Approach focuses on de-escalation and prevention by modifying the environment and staff behavior to reduce the 'arousal' levels of the Autistic individual."

                "A purely behavioral plan that rewards the client for staying at their desk.",
