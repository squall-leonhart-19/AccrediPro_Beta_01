            "question": "In the context of Advanced Individualized Treatment Planning (ITP), what is the primary distinction of a 'Neuro-Affirming' approach compared to traditional behavioral models?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on eliminating repetitive behaviors (stimming).",
                "It prioritizes the client's internal experience and autonomy over external compliance.",
                "It utilizes high-intensity aversive consequences to speed up skill acquisition.",
                "It ignores data collection in favor of qualitative anecdotes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming ITPs shift the focus from 'fixing' the individual to supporting their unique neurology, prioritizing autonomy, sensory safety, and authentic communication over mere social compliance."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "According to the Transdisciplinary Integration model discussed in L2, what does the term 'Role Release' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Firing a staff member who does not follow the treatment plan.",
                "The process of a specialist teaching their specific skills to other team members to ensure consistent implementation.",
                "Allowing the client to choose which therapist they want to work with each day.",
                "The termination of services once a client reaches age 18."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Role release is a hallmark of transdisciplinary care where specialists (like OTs or SLPs) train other team members to implement specific strategies across all environments, ensuring the plan is truly integrated."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When applying the SMART+ framework to goal setting, what does the '+' specifically represent in neuro-affirming practice?",
            "options": [
                "Plus-sized data sets (at least 100 trials).",
                "Positive reinforcement only.",
                "Strength-based and Autistic-led/aligned.",
                "The inclusion of at least one pharmacological intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The '+' in SMART+ ensures that goals are not just technically sound (Specific, Measurable, etc.) but are also rooted in the individual's strengths and aligned with the Autistic community's values and the client's personal preferences."

            "options": [
                "Academic skills such as reading and math.",
                "Social skills such as initiating play with peers.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is the foundation of the clinical hierarchy. Behaviors that involve self-injury or aggression (High Impact/High Urgency) must be prioritized to create a stable environment for further learning."

            "id": "q21_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental management is a high-leverage strategy. Specific data shows that reducing sensory load (like noise) directly correlates with improved focus and reduced behavioral distress."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In L6, the 'Percentage of Non-Overlapping Data' (PND) is used to determine treatment efficacy. A PND score of 90% or higher is interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "An ineffective intervention.",
                "A questionably effective intervention.",

                "A failed data collection process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PND is a rigorous metric for evaluating single-subject research and clinical progress. A score above 90% indicates that the intervention is highly effective and the change is likely due to the treatment."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (Age 9) has met her goal of 'using a visual schedule' in the clinic with 95% accuracy but fails to use it at home. What is the most appropriate ITP adjustment based on L7?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the difficulty of the clinic goal.",
                "Discontinue the goal as she has mastered it.",

                "Refer Sarah for a new diagnostic evaluation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery in a clinical setting without generalization is a common pitfall. Family-centered planning requires integrating caregivers into the training process to ensure skills transfer to real-world settings."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "According to the 2023 Meta-analysis (n=4,234) mentioned in L8, transition plans that include specific 'Self-Determination Training' increase the likelihood of post-secondary employment by:",

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Which 'Stability Criterion' is recommended in L6 before making a significant change to a treatment intervention?",
            "options": [
                "At least 3 consecutive data points showing a consistent trend or level.",
                "A single data point that looks different from the others.",

                "Only changing the plan if the caregiver requests it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To avoid 'chasing noise' in data, practitioners should look for a stable trend (usually 3-5 data points) to confirm that the observed change is consistent before modifying the intervention."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "In L4, the 'Rule of Three' in prioritization suggests that an ITP should focus on no more than 3 high-priority domains simultaneously. Why?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the cost of the treatment plan.",
                "To prevent cognitive overload for the client and implementation fatigue for the caregivers.",
                "Because insurance companies only pay for three goals.",
                "To make the paperwork easier for the clinician."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on too many goals simultaneously dilutes the intensity of the intervention and leads to burnout for both the client and the family. Narrowing the focus ensures high-quality implementation and better outcomes."
