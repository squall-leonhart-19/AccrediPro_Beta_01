            "options": [
                "It refers to the physical discomfort of working in a non-ergonomic environment.",
                "It describes the blurring of professional and personal roles that occurs when practitioners are treated like 'part of the family.'",
                "It is a specific data-collection error that occurs during mealtime observations.",
                "It refers to the legal liability of accidental property damage in a client's home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Kitchen Table Trap' is a term used to describe the erosion of professional boundaries in home settings where the practitioner may inadvertently slip into a friend/family role, compromising objective clinical judgment."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, what is the primary ethical distinction between 'Informed Consent' and 'Assent' for non-vocal clients?",
            "options": [
                "Informed consent is required for adults, while assent is only for children under age 5.",
                "Consent is a legal authorization provided by a guardian, while assent is the client's ongoing voluntary agreement expressed through behavior.",
                "Assent is a legally binding document signed by the client's speech-language pathologist.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms refer to the same legal requirement for medical procedures."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consent is the legal permission (usually from a guardian), whereas assent is the client's active, behavioral participation and lack of protest, which must be monitored continuously, especially with non-vocal individuals."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A 2022 survey on Neurodiversity-Affirming practice (referenced in L3) suggested that 'compliance-based' interventions may lead to what long-term outcome in autistic adults?",
            "options": [
                "Increased vocational success and higher income levels.",
                "Improved social integration and reduced anxiety.",
                "Increased vulnerability to abuse due to a lack of self-advocacy skills and 'fawn' responses.",
                "Complete remediation of core autistic traits by age 25."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that training autistic individuals to comply strictly with adult demands without the right to say 'no' can lead to prompt dependency and an inability to set boundaries, increasing the risk of being victimized later in life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that Black and Latino children are often diagnosed later than White children and are more likely to receive 'behavioral' labels like ODD or Conduct Disorder before their neurodivergence is recognized."

                "Only unethical if the practitioner fails to report the income to the IRS."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Referral fees (kickbacks) are considered unethical because they create a financial incentive that may bias the practitioner’s recommendations, potentially leading them to suggest services that are not in the client’s best interest."

                "The treatment results are published in peer-reviewed journals with large sample sizes.",

                "The practitioner encourages the client to continue evidence-based therapies alongside the new approach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pseudoscience often relies on testimonials and 'miracle' claims rather than empirical, peer-reviewed data and controlled clinical trials."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The duty of competence requires practitioners to recognize their limits and only provide services for which they are qualified. Working outside one's scope of practice is an ethical violation."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A non-vocal client repeatedly pushes the practitioner's hand away during a PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) session. What is the most ethical immediate response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Respecting behavioral assent means acknowledging that pushing away is a form of communication. The ethical response is to pause and assess the client's motivation and comfort rather than forcing compliance."
