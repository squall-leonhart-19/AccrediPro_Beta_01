            "question": "In Precision Teaching (L1), the concept of 'Fluency' is mathematically defined as which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Accuracy multiplied by the duration of the task",
                "Accuracy plus speed (Rate of response per minute)",
                "The number of correct responses minus the number of errors",
                "The ability to generalize a skill to three different settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluency is defined as the combination of accuracy and speed (Rate). Precision Teaching emphasizes that a student must not only perform a task correctly but also do it quickly enough to ensure long-term retention and application (RESA: Retention, Endurance, Stability, Application)."

            "options": [
                "Massed trial instruction in a controlled environment",
                "Arbitrary reinforcers like tokens or stickers for all tasks",
                "Shared affect and natural contingencies within social interactions",
                "Strict adherence to a pre-determined manual without flexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NDBIs (L2) integrate behavioral principles with developmental science, focusing on natural reinforcers, shared engagement, and child-led interactions to promote social-communication development."

            "question": "When adapting Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for neurodivergent clients, which modification is most effective for addressing 'alexithymia'?",
            "options": [
                "Using abstract metaphors to describe complex emotions",
                "Implementing visual emotion scales (e.g., 1-10) and physiological monitoring",
                "Focusing exclusively on cognitive restructuring without behavioral activation",
                "Lengthening the sessions to allow for more verbal processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients with alexithymia (difficulty identifying emotions), L3 teaches that using visual scales and linking emotions to physical sensations (physiological monitoring) provides the concrete data needed for CBT to be effective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metacognition involves Plan, Monitor, and Evaluate. Asking if a current strategy is working is a direct prompt for 'Monitoring'—the real-time assessment of one's cognitive performance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mutual Entailment (L5) is the simplest form of derived relational responding. If a child learns that the word 'Apple' refers to the fruit, they should derive that the fruit is referred to by the word 'Apple' without explicit training."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming care recognizes that sensory processing differences can lead to traumatic experiences. Validating these as real physiological stressors is a cornerstone of the TIC approach in Module 23."

                "Social cognition is entirely dependent on IQ scores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication issues are a 'two-way street'—both autistic and neurotypical individuals struggle to understand the perspectives and social cues of the other neurotype."

            "id": "q23_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AI integration (L8) is used for executive function support, such as breaking down complex tasks or drafting social communications (scripts) that reduce the cognitive load of 'masking' or social anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VR provides a 'safe-to-fail' environment. Lesson 8 notes its effectiveness in social cognition training, allowing clients to practice job interviews or public transit navigation without real-world consequences."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "When using the Standard Celeration Chart in Precision Teaching, a 'steepening' line of correct responses indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The student is losing the skill and needs more help",
                "The intervention is ineffective and should be stopped",
                "The rate of learning is accelerating (Celeration)",
                "The task is too difficult and the student is guessing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On a Standard Celeration Chart (L1), 'Celeration' refers to the change in rate over time. A steepening line indicates that the student is learning faster as time progresses, which is the goal of fluency-based instruction."
