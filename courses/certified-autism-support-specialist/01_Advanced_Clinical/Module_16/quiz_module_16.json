            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a high comorbidity rate, with 50-70% of autistic individuals also presenting with ADHD symptoms, requiring integrated treatment plans that address both neurodivergent profiles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a behavior continues in the absence of a demand or social trigger, it often serves a sensory or 'automatic' function, helping the individual regulate their nervous system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
