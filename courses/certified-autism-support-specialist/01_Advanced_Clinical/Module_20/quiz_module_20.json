            "question": "When administering the ADOS-2, which module is specifically designed for children and adolescents who have fluent speech but are not yet adults?",
            "options": ["Module 1", "Module 2", "Module 3", "Module 4"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Module 3 is designed for children and adolescents with fluent speech, whereas Module 4 is intended for fluently speaking adolescents and adults. Modules 1 and 2 are for pre-verbal or single-word users."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "According to Winnie Dunn's Model of Sensory Processing (used in the SP-2), a client who has a high neurological threshold but uses an active self-regulation strategy is categorized as:",
            "options": ["Sensory Sensitive", "Sensation Seeking", "Low Registration", "Sensation Avoiding"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensation Seekers have a high threshold (needing more input to react) and use active strategies to find that input. Low Registration also has a high threshold but uses a passive strategy."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "The BRIEF-2 (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) provides a 'Global Executive Composite.' Which of the following is NOT one of the primary indexes measured by this tool?",
            "options": ["Behavior Regulation Index", "Cognitive Regulation Index", "Emotion Regulation Index", "Social Communication Index"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The BRIEF-2 measures Behavior, Emotion, and Cognitive Regulation. Social Communication is typically measured by tools like the SRS-2 or CCC-2, not executive function scales."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In the Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Scales, what is the primary difference between the 'v-scale' scores and the 'Domain Standard Scores'?",
            "options": ["v-scales measure potential, while Domains measure actual performance", "v-scales have a mean of 15 and SD of 3, while Domains have a mean of 100 and SD of 15", "v-scales are only used for adults", "Domains are used for clinical diagnosis, v-scales are for research only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vineland-3 uses v-scale scores (Mean=15, SD=3) for subdomains and Standard Scores (Mean=100, SD=15) for the broader Domains and the Adaptive Behavior Composite."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A practitioner is using the Children's Communication Checklist (CCC-2). Which score profile is most indicative of a Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder rather than a structural language impairment?",
            "options": ["High scores in Syntax and Morphology", "Low scores in Speech and Impairment with high Pragmatic scores", "Weaknesses specifically in the 'Pragmatic Composite' despite average structural language scores", "Uniformly low scores across all 10 subscales"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CCC-2 is specifically designed to identify pragmatic language impairment in individuals who may have relatively intact structural language (grammar/syntax) but struggle with social use."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "What is the defining characteristic of a 'Functional Analysis' (FA) as part of an Advanced FBA, compared to descriptive assessments?",
            "options": ["It relies solely on parent interviews", "It involves the systematic manipulation of antecedents and consequences to observe effects on behavior", "It is a paper-and-pencil test only", "It focuses on the topography of the behavior rather than the function"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Functional Analysis (FA) is experimental; it involves deliberately changing environmental variables to confirm the function of a behavior, whereas descriptive FBAs only observe behavior in natural settings."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Research indicates that approximately what percentage of autistic individuals meet the criteria for at least one co-occurring psychiatric condition, necessitating the use of screening tools like the CASI-5?",
            "options": ["15-20%", "30-40%", "Over 70%", "Exactly 100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including meta-analyses, consistently show that over 70% of autistic individuals have at least one co-occurring psychiatric condition, such as anxiety or ADHD."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which progress monitoring method uses a 5-point scale (-2 to +2) to quantify progress toward highly individualized goals that may not be captured by standardized tests?",
            "options": ["Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM)", "Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)", "Standard Celeration Charting", "Direct Behavior Rating (DBR)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a specialized method used in autism intervention to track progress on specific, individualized goals using a standardized -2 to +2 numerical scale."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "To meet the 'Gold Standard' for autism diagnosis, the ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised) focuses on which three developmental domains?",
            "options": ["Motor skills, Visual perception, and Self-care", "IQ, Academic achievement, and Sensory processing", "Social interaction, Communication, and Restricted/Repetitive behaviors", "Anxiety, Depression, and Executive Function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ADI-R focuses on the three core areas defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 (which still form the basis of the interview): Reciprocal Social Interaction, Communication/Language, and Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Patterns of Behavior."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When assessing a 12-year-old client with a suspected 'Sensation Avoiding' profile on the SPM-2, which behavior would you most likely expect to see in the classroom?",
            "options": ["The student constantly hums and taps their desk", "The student covers their ears and hides under the desk during the school bell", "The student fails to notice when their name is called", "The student frequently bumps into furniture and other students"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensation Avoiding involves a low neurological threshold and an active strategy to move away from input. Covering ears and hiding are active behaviors to reduce overwhelming sensory stimuli (the bell)."
