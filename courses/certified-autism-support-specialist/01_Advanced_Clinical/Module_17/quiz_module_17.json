                "25-30%",
                "45-50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows high rates of dual diagnosis, with approximately 70-80% of autistic adults experiencing co-occurring conditions such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD."

            "options": [
                "A behavioral disorder characterized by intentional defiance and lack of empathy.",
                "An anxiety-driven need for control where perceived demands trigger a 'fight-flight-freeze' response.",
                "A cognitive deficit that prevents the understanding of social hierarchies.",
                "A sensory processing disorder specifically related to auditory triggers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDA is increasingly understood as a profile where the nervous system perceives a loss of autonomy as a threat, triggering intense anxiety and a biological drive to regain control."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When advocating for non-speaking or minimally verbal adults, what does the principle of 'Presuming Competence' entail?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presuming competence is the 'least dangerous assumption,' ensuring that individuals are provided with age-appropriate information and robust communication tools based on the belief in their inherent intelligence."

            "options": [
                "The officer and the autistic individual fail to understand each other's communication styles, leading to misinterpretations of guilt.",
                "The autistic individual feels too much empathy for the officer and confesses to crimes they didn't commit.",
                "The officer uses too much empathy, which confuses the autistic individual's sensory processing.",
                "Both parties are unable to feel any emotion during the interaction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns occur because of a bidirectional mismatch in social expectations and communication styles, often leading officers to view autistic traits (like lack of eye contact) as signs of deception."

            "id": "q17_5",

                "Autistic individuals are biologically immune to neurodegenerative diseases.",
                "Diagnostic overshadowing, where new cognitive declines are incorrectly attributed to pre-existing autistic traits.",
                "Autistic individuals lose their autism diagnosis as they age, making it easier to see dementia.",
                "There are no validated cognitive screening tools for adults over the age of 65."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians attribute new symptoms of dementia to the person's autism, potentially delaying necessary medical intervention or support."

                "Burnout does not involve feelings of sadness or low mood.",
                "Depression is always caused by sensory overload, while burnout is not.",
                "Autistic Burnout is characterized by a significant loss of previously mastered skills (regression) and increased sensory sensitivity.",
                "Depression only occurs in verbal autistic individuals, whereas burnout occurs in non-verbal individuals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While they can co-occur, Autistic Burnout is specifically defined by the exhaustion of 'masking' and results in a loss of functional skills and heightened sensory reactivity that is not typical of standard depression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Large-scale studies indicate a significant intersection between neurodiversity and gender diversity, with autistic individuals being 3 to 6 times more likely to be transgender or non-binary."

                "Using clear, firm, imperative commands to establish authority.",
                "Implementing a strict 'First/Then' reward system to ensure compliance.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Declarative language reduces the 'threat' response in PDA individuals by phrasing needs as observations or collaborations rather than direct demands that strip away autonomy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a crisis, the priority is de-escalation through sensory reduction and removing demands, as the individual is in a state of neurological overwhelm and cannot process complex verbal information."
