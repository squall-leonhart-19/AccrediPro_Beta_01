            "question": "According to Damian Milton’s 'Double Empathy Problem,' social communication breakdowns between autistic and allistic individuals are primarily caused by:",
            "options": [
                "A core neurological deficit in the autistic person's theory of mind",
                "A bidirectional lack of understanding due to differing dispositional orientations",
                "The autistic individual's inability to process non-verbal cues in real-time",
                "A lack of motivation on the part of the neurotypical person to engage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication issues are a 'two-way street' where both parties struggle to empathize with the other's lived experience, rather than a one-sided deficit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Academic settings provide high levels of structure (syllabi, deadlines, clear rubrics) that are often absent in professional settings, requiring a significant increase in internal self-regulation and task initiation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "explanation": "Partial disclosure (e.g., 'I work best with written instructions' rather than 'I am autistic') allows a client to secure environmental supports while avoiding the biases some employers hold toward the autism label."
