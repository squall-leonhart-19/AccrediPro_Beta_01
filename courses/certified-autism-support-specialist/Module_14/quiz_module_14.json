            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which aspect of pragmatic language involves the ability to adjust communication styles based on the listener's needs or the specific social context (e.g., speaking differently to a supervisor versus a peer)?",
            "options": ["Code-switching", "Prosody", "Echolalia", "Central Coherence"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Code-switching in a social-pragmatic sense refers to the ability to adapt communication style, tone, and complexity based on the environment and the person being addressed."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'High-Stakes Scaffolding' for executive functioning, what is the primary objective when supporting an autistic student in higher education?",
            "options": ["To provide permanent 1-on-1 assistance for all tasks", "To gradually fade external supports while building internal self-regulation strategies", "To eliminate all deadlines to reduce stress", "To focus exclusively on academic content rather than organizational skills"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-stakes scaffolding aims to provide the necessary support to prevent failure in critical environments while systematically fading that support to foster independence and self-management."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that approximately what percentage of autistic individuals experience alexithymia?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "20-25%", "45-55%", "85-90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that roughly 50% (ranges often cited between 45-55%) of the autistic population experiences alexithymia, compared to approximately 10% of the general population."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Interoception, the 'internal sense,' is critical for emotional regulation because it allows an individual to:",
            "options": ["Identify external sounds more accurately", "Recognize internal physiological signals that precede emotional states", "Improve their gross motor coordination", "Navigate physical spaces without bumping into objects"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Recognizing signals like a racing heart or muscle tension is often the first step in identifying and regulating an emotional response."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "When transitioning from high school to a vocational or university setting, how does the legal framework for disability support change in the United States?",
            "options": ["The school is legally required to identify and seek out students with disabilities", "The burden of disclosure and requesting accommodations shifts entirely to the student", "IEPs remain legally binding documents that colleges must follow exactly", "Parents retain the legal right to make all academic decisions for the student"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under the ADA and Section 504, the student must self-disclose their disability and provide documentation to receive accommodations, a significant shift from the proactive identification required by IDEA in K-12."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "The 'Double Empathy Problem,' proposed by Damian Milton (2012), suggests that social communication breakdowns occur because:",
            "options": ["Autistic individuals lack the neurological capacity for empathy", "Non-autistic individuals are more skilled at reading body language", "There is a mutual disconnect in understanding between two different groups with different lived experiences", "Social communication is an innate skill that cannot be learned"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication issues are a 'two-way street' caused by a mismatch in communication styles and experiences between neurodivergent and neurotypical people, rather than a deficit solely in the autistic person."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Liam,' an autistic college student, demonstrates high cognitive ability but consistently fails to submit assignments on time despite knowing the material. This is most likely a deficit in which executive function domain?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Difficulty starting a task and organizing the steps required to complete and submit it is a hallmark of task initiation and organizational deficits, common in autistic individuals with high academic potential."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'Neuro-Inclusive' workplace modification based on Universal Design principles?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universal Design benefits everyone. Providing written summaries helps autistic employees process information while also serving as a helpful reference for neurotypical employees, reducing ambiguity for everyone."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "In the context of intimate relationships, 'social connectivity' for an autistic adult is best supported by:",
            "options": ["Forcing the individual to attend as many social events as possible", "Focusing on 'masking' skills to appear more neurotypical", "Identifying shared interests and 'parallel play' opportunities to build rapport", "Avoiding all discussions of boundaries or consent"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Building connections through shared interests (monotropism) and accepting 'parallel play' (being in the same space doing different things) are authentic ways autistic individuals build intimacy and rapport."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which outcome is most strongly associated with the development of strong self-advocacy skills and a positive neurodivergent identity?",
            "options": ["Higher rates of 'masking' and social exhaustion", "Increased reliance on parental decision-making", "Improved Quality of Life (QoL) and psychological well-being", "The eventual 'curing' of autistic traits"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Developing self-advocacy and a positive identity allows individuals to request what they need, reduce harmful masking, and lead a self-determined life, which significantly correlates with higher Quality of Life scores."
