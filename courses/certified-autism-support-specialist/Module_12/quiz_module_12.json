            "question": "The 'Transition Cliff' refers to the shift from the IDEA framework to the ADA/Section 504 framework. What is the primary legal distinction between these two?",
            "options": [
                "IDEA is based on entitlement to services, while ADA is based on eligibility and the provision of reasonable accommodations.",
                "IDEA requires the individual to self-disclose, while ADA requires the state to identify the individual.",
                "IDEA only applies to physical disabilities, while ADA applies to neurodevelopmental conditions.",
                "There is no legal distinction; both frameworks provide the same level of mandated support services."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Under IDEA, students are entitled to a free and appropriate public education (FAPE). Once they transition to adulthood, the ADA and Section 504 require individuals to prove eligibility and request specific accommodations; the 'entitlement' to a success-based outcome ends."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic burnout is distinct because it involves a 'regression' or loss of skills (e.g., losing the ability to speak or manage self-care) and a dramatic decrease in sensory tolerance due to chronic over-exertion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In ASD, repetitive behaviors (stimming) are often ego-syntonic, meaning they provide comfort or pleasure. In OCD, rituals are ego-dystonic, meaning the individual finds them distressing and wishes they didn't have to perform them."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reasonable accommodations under the ADA are meant to remove barriers while allowing the employee to perform essential job functions. Noise-canceling headphones and workspace adjustments are standard, effective modifications."
