            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During a crisis peak, the Amygdala overrides the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), which is responsible for executive function and language processing, making verbal reasoning ineffective."

                "They should be scheduled regularly for clients with a history of aggression",
                "They are preferred over verbal de-escalation for non-verbal clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethically and legally, restrictive interventions must be a last resort, used only in cases of imminent danger to life or limb when all other strategies are exhausted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic individuals often exhibit high suggestibility and 'compliance bias' in high-pressure social situations, such as interrogations, increasing the risk of false confessions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic debriefing focuses on learning, identifying environmental or protocol triggers, and providing psychological support to the team to prevent burnout and future crises."

                "They have stopped screaming for at least 5 minutes",
                "Their physiological markers (heart rate, respiration) have returned to their personal baseline",
                "They have apologized for their behavior",
                "They have been administered sedative medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization is marked by a return to physiological baseline; entering a routine too early (while cortisol is still high) significantly increases the risk of a 'secondary spike' or relapse into crisis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic camouflaging (masking) leads to intense psychological exhaustion and a sense of 'thwarted belongingness,' which are significant predictors of suicidality in the ASD population."
