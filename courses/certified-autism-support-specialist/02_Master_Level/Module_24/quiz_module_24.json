            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While both ASD and SCD involve social communication deficits, the presence of RRBs (past or present) is the mandatory 'Tier 2' requirement that distinguishes ASD from SCD."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Social Engagement System is mediated by the Ventral Vagal Complex, which facilitates heart rate variability and the ability to connect with others in a state of safety."
