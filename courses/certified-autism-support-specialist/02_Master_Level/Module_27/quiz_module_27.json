            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with an autistic adult exhibiting new self-injurious behavior. The clinical team attributes this solely to 'autistic outbursts' without investigating a potential underlying depressive disorder. This is an example of which clinical phenomenon?",
            "options": ["Symptom substitution", "Diagnostic overshadowing", "Cognitive dissonance", "Comorbid masking"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians erroneously attribute psychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes to the patient's developmental disability (Autism) rather than a co-occurring mental or physical health condition."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that autistic individuals are significantly more likely to interact with the justice system. According to forensic advocacy data, what is a primary risk factor for false confessions during police interrogations?",
            "options": ["Hyper-fixation on legal jargon", "High levels of suggestibility and desire to please authority figures", "Lack of verbal communication skills", "Aggressive resistance to questioning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic individuals often exhibit high levels of suggestibility and 'compliance,' a desire to end a stressful social interaction by agreeing with the interrogator, which increases the risk of false confessions."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In the context of Geriatric Autism, the 'Service Cliff' refers to which specific challenge facing the aging neurodivergent population?",
            "options": ["The sudden loss of cognitive function at age 65", "The lack of specialized residential and medical support as primary caregivers (parents) age or pass away", "The physical inability to navigate public transportation", "The biological decrease in sensory sensitivities over time"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Service Cliff' in geriatrics describes the crisis that occurs when lifelong family caregivers age or die, leaving the autistic adult without a support system in a world where few geriatric facilities are trained in neurodiversity."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "An Autism Support Specialist is implementing 'Job Carving' for a client in a corporate setting. Which of the following best describes this strategy?",
            "options": ["Requiring the client to work in a separate room from others", "Standardizing all job descriptions to ensure equality", "Modifying a job description to match a client's specific strengths while reassigning tasks they struggle with", "Firing neurotypical employees to make room for neurodivergent hires"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Job carving is a vocational strategy where a role is customized by analyzing tasks and tailoring the position to the specific skills of the autistic individual, often benefiting the employer's efficiency."

            "options": ["The shift from IDEA (entitlement-based) to ADA/Section 504 (eligibility-based)", "The shift from HIPAA to FERPA protections", "The mandatory requirement for a full-time 1:1 aide in college", "The elimination of all testing accommodations"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In K-12, the IDEA mandates that schools find and serve students (entitlement). In higher education, the ADA and Section 504 require the student to self-disclose and provide documentation to prove eligibility for accommodations."

            "options": ["Using loud, firm commands to establish dominance", "Reducing the practitioner's physical presence, eye contact, and verbal demands", "Immediate physical restraint to prevent any movement", "Using bright lights to 'reset' the visual system"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Low Arousal Approach focuses on de-escalation by reducing environmental and interpersonal triggers, such as avoiding direct eye contact and lowering voice volume, to decrease the individual's physiological arousal."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wearables that monitor EDA (sweat gland activity) can detect rising physiological stress levels, allowing for proactive intervention before a behavioral crisis or meltdown occurs."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "When working with diverse global populations, a specialist must recognize that 'Stigma' regarding an Autism diagnosis can vary. In some collectivist cultures, an ASD diagnosis may be viewed as:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In many collectivist cultures, disability is often viewed through a lens of family honor, where a diagnosis may be seen as a reflection on the entire family's lineage or 'karma,' impacting social standing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
