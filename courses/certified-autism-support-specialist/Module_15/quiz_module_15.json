            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are a two-way street; neurotypical people often have as much trouble understanding autistic people as vice versa."

            "explanation": "Standard CBT relies on the client noticing internal states (interoception). If a client has Alexithymia, they may not realize they are anxious until they are in a full meltdown, requiring a 'bottom-up' approach instead."
