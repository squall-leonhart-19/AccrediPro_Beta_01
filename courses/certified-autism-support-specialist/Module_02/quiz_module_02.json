            "question": "Research into the neurobiological architecture of Level 1 ASD suggests a specific connectivity pattern. Which of the following best describes this 'connectivity paradox'?",
            "options": [
                "Global hyper-connectivity across all brain regions",
                "Increased local connectivity in sensory regions with decreased long-range connectivity between the frontal and posterior lobes",
                "Decreased local connectivity in the amygdala with increased long-range connectivity to the prefrontal cortex",
                "Total absence of synaptic pruning in the cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Level 1 ASD is characterized by 'local hyper-connectivity' (explaining sensory sensitivity and detail-focus) and 'long-range hypo-connectivity' (explaining challenges in integrating complex information across different brain regions)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to Murray’s Theory of Monotropism, why do individuals with Level 1 ASD often struggle with task-switching?",
            "options": [
                "They lack the intellectual capacity to understand new instructions",
                "They are intentionally being oppositional to maintain control",
                "Their 'attention tunnel' is so high-intensity that pulling resources away to a new stimulus causes significant neurological distress",
                "They have a deficit in short-term memory that prevents them from remembering the next task"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Monotropism suggests that autistic attention is distributed into few 'tunnels' of high intensity. Switching tasks requires an immense amount of cognitive energy to break the current flow state and re-allocate resources."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client frequently forgets to eat until they are lightheaded or fails to realize their bladder is full until it is an emergency. Which sensory system is likely impaired?",
            "options": [
                "Proprioception",
                "Vestibular processing",
                "Tactile discrimination",
                "Interoception"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the 'eighth sense' responsible for sensing internal bodily states, including hunger, thirst, heart rate, and the need to use the bathroom."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Social Communication, what is the primary purpose of 'phatic communication' that individuals with ASD often find difficult or illogical?",
            "options": [
                "To establish social rapport and signal 'friendliness' rather than to exchange factual information",
                "To debate complex philosophical ideas using metaphors",
                "To provide detailed instructions on how to complete a technical task",
                "To use sarcasm to point out social inconsistencies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phatic communication (small talk) serves a social-grooming function. Because many Level 1 individuals prioritize the 'exchange of information,' they may view phatic speech as inefficient or confusing."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "The 'Double Empathy Problem,' proposed by Dr. Damian Milton, challenges the traditional view of Theory of Mind by suggesting that:",
            "options": [
                "Autistic people have twice the empathy of non-autistic people",
                "Non-autistic people lack empathy entirely",
                "Communication breakdowns occur because of a mutual mismatch in disposition and experience between autistic and allistic people",
                "Empathy is a purely biological reflex that cannot be learned"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that the 'social deficit' is bidirectional; allistic people are often just as bad at understanding autistic perspectives as vice versa."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which brain region is most specifically associated with the 'mentalizing' network and perspective-taking, often showing atypical activation in Level 1 ASD?",
            "options": [
                "Right Temporoparietal Junction (rTPJ)",
                "Primary Visual Cortex",
                "Medulla Oblongata",
                "Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The rTPJ is a critical hub for Theory of Mind and processing the thoughts and intentions of others. Studies show reduced activation or atypical connectivity in this area in autistic populations."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A 2013 study (Bird & Cook) suggests that approximately what percentage of the autistic population also meets the criteria for Alexithymia?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "25%",
                "50%",
                "95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 50% of autistic individuals experience alexithymia (difficulty identifying and describing emotions), compared to roughly 10% in the general population."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When performing a differential diagnosis, how is Level 1 ASD distinguished from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)?",
            "options": [
                "People with SAD have the underlying social-pragmatic skills but are too afraid to use them; people with ASD often lack the underlying 'know-how'",
                "ASD is only diagnosed if the person also has a low IQ",
                "SAD involves repetitive hand flapping, while ASD does not",
                "There is no difference; they are the same condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The core of SAD is the fear of negative evaluation despite having the social skills. In ASD, the primary challenge is the neurological difficulty in processing social cues and pragmatics, regardless of anxiety levels."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the 'Anatomy of a Meltdown,' what is the physiological state of the individual during the 'Explosion' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex is in full control and making rational choices",
                "The Amygdala has triggered a 'sympathetic hijack,' effectively bypassing the rational brain",
                "The person is consciously calculating how to get a specific reward",
                "The parasympathetic nervous system is dominant, causing a state of deep relaxation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A meltdown is an involuntary physiological response. The 'amygdala hijack' means the brain's threat-detection system has taken over, making rational thought and 'behavioral choices' impossible until the system resets."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs) in Level 1 ASD, such as intense 'Special Interests,' are often clinically reconsidered as:",
            "options": [
                "A waste of cognitive resources that must be extinguished",
                "A symptom of OCD that requires high-dose medication",
                "A 'bottom-up' processing strength and a vital tool for emotional regulation and energy restoration",
                "A sign of regression in social development"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern neuro-affirming practice views special interests as essential for regulation. They allow the individual to enter 'flow states' which reduce cortisol and help manage the sensory/social exhaustion of daily life."
