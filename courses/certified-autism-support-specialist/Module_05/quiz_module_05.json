            "question": "Research indicates that Executive Functioning (EF) deficits are often more predictive of adaptive functioning than IQ in Level 1 ASD. Which specific EF domain involves the ability to switch between mental sets or tasks?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibitory Control",
                "Working Memory",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive flexibility, or set-shifting, is the ability to transition between different concepts or tasks and is a core challenge in Level 1 ASD, often manifesting as 'rigidity' or difficulty with changes in routine."

            "options": [
                "Autistic individuals lack the biological capacity for empathy.",
                "There is a bidirectional mismatch in communication styles and experiences between autistic and non-autistic people.",
                "Neurotypical individuals are inherently better at reading the body language of all neurotypes.",
                "Level 1 ASD individuals over-empathize, leading to social withdrawal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are not just 'deficits' in the autistic person, but a result of two different neurotypes failing to understand each other's unique social cues and perspectives."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client with Level 1 ASD reports that they can hear the hum of the refrigerator as loudly as a person speaking to them. This is an example of a failure in which neurological process?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory gating is the neurological process of filtering out redundant or unnecessary stimuli. Many individuals with ASD have reduced gating, leading to sensory overload from background noises or lights."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weak Central Coherence refers to a processing style that prioritizes local details over global synthesis, making it difficult to understand the overall context or 'gist' of a situation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 50% of the autistic population experiences alexithymia, which significantly impacts emotional regulation and the ability to communicate internal states to others."

            "question": "While many Level 1 adults pass basic (first-order) Theory of Mind tests, they may still struggle with 'Second-Order False Belief' tasks. What does a second-order task require?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Second-order Theory of Mind involves recursive thinking (e.g., 'I think that Mary thinks that John knows...'), which is often where nuanced social misunderstandings occur in Level 1 ASD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Hidden Curriculum' consists of the unstated social norms and expectations that neurotypical individuals often pick up intuitively but which must be explicitly taught to many autistic individuals."

            "options": [
                "The individual has no desire for social connection.",
                "Social difficulties are present even when the individual is not feeling anxious.",
                "Anxiety only occurs in large crowds, not one-on-one.",
                "There are no repetitive behaviors or restricted interests."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While SAD is characterized by a fear of social judgment, ASD involves a fundamental difference in processing social information and pragmatic communication that persists regardless of the individual's anxiety level."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Difficulty adapting to unexpected changes in schedule is a hallmark of impaired cognitive flexibility, common in Level 1 ASD, where routines provide necessary predictability and safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up strategies involve modifying the environment to reduce sensory input at the source, rather than requiring the individual to use cognitive effort (top-down) to manage the resulting distress."
