            "question": "In the context of Neurobiology, 'Cool' Executive Functioning (EF) deficits in Level 1 ASD primarily impact which of the following processes?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional regulation and reward-seeking behavior",
                "Working memory, planning, and task initiation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cool EF refers to logic-based, non-emotional cognitive processes such as working memory and planning, which are typically associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."

            "question": "While many Level 1 individuals pass first-order Theory of Mind tests, they often struggle with 'Second-Order' beliefs. What does this concept entail?",
            "options": [
                "Understanding that another person has a different physical perspective",
                "Recognizing one's own internal emotional state",

                "The ability to mimic social cues in a group setting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Second-order Theory of Mind involves recursive thinking (e.g., 'I think that John thinks that Mary knows...'), which is a common area of difficulty in advanced social cognition for L1 ASD."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding cognitive flexibility found that L1 Autistic individuals often show increased activation in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) during task-switching. What does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Task-switching is an effortless, automated process for them",
                "The brain is working harder and requiring more cognitive load to perform set-shifting",
                "There is a complete lack of connectivity between the ACC and the motor cortex",
                "The individual is experiencing a sensory meltdown"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased activation in the ACC during set-shifting indicates that the brain must exert significantly more compensatory effort to transition between tasks compared to neurotypical peers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Conversational repair is a critical pragmatic skill involving the detection of communication breakdowns and the subsequent adjustment of the message to ensure understanding."

            "question": "Research suggests that approximately 50% of Autistic adults experience 'Alexithymia.' How does this condition impact the Internalizing Profile?",
            "options": [
                "It makes them more likely to externalize anger through physical outbursts",
                "It results in an inability to feel any emotions at all",
                "It creates difficulty in identifying and describing one's own emotions, leading to increased anxiety",
                "It improves their ability to mask in social situations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alexithymia is the difficulty in identifying and labeling emotions, which often contributes to internalizing symptoms like generalized anxiety because the individual cannot process their physiological arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory masking involves suppressing responses to uncomfortable stimuli to fit in, which requires immense energy and frequently leads to exhaustion or burnout in high-functioning profiles."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Despite having the necessary academic credentials, approximately 85% of Autistic college graduates face unemployment or underemployment, often due to social pragmatic barriers in the hiring process."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L1 individuals often experience 'Affective Empathy' (feeling the emotions of others) quite intensely, while the struggle lies in 'Cognitive Empathy' (the intellectual process of identifying what another is thinking)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
