            "question": "Why is the term 'High Functioning' increasingly rejected in clinical practice for Level 1 Autistic individuals?",
            "options": [
                "It implies that the individual does not require any support or accommodations.",
                "It focuses on external compliance while ignoring the internal cost of masking and support needs.",
                "It suggests that the individual's IQ is significantly higher than the general population.",
                "It is a diagnostic term that has been removed from the DSM-5-TR."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The term 'High Functioning' is problematic because it often overlooks the significant internal effort, sensory processing challenges, and mental health costs (like burnout) that Level 1 individuals face despite appearing 'normal' to others."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "An L1 individual struggles with 'Task Initiation' even when they are motivated to complete a project. Which executive functioning concept best explains this?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Flexibility",
                "Working Memory Overflow",
                "Autistic Inertia",
                "Central Coherence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autistic Inertia refers to the difficulty in starting a task (or stopping one). It is a specific executive functioning challenge where the 'friction' of transitioning from a state of rest to action is significantly higher for Autistic brains."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the 'Hidden Curriculum' was discussed. What does this term specifically refer to in social communication?",
            "options": [
                "The literal rules of grammar and syntax used in professional writing.",
                "The unwritten, unspoken social rules and expectations that neurotypicals usually pick up intuitively.",
                "A secret set of instructions provided to teachers in special education classrooms.",
                "The specific academic requirements needed for a student to graduate from high school."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hidden Curriculum involves the nuanced social 'rules'—such as knowing when a joke has gone too far or understanding sarcasm—that are not explicitly taught but are expected in social interactions."

                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by Bird & Cook (2013), suggest that roughly 50% of the Autistic population experiences Alexithymia, which is the difficulty in identifying and describing one's own emotions."

            "question": "How does 'Monotropism' differ from 'Polytropism' in the context of cognitive processing?",
            "options": [
                "Monotropism refers to the ability to multitask effectively, while Polytropism focuses on a single interest.",
                "Monotropism is a state of hyper-focus where attention is funneled into a few interests, while Polytropism spreads attention across many channels.",
                "Monotropism is a sensory disorder, while Polytropism is a social communication disorder.",
                "There is no difference; they are both terms for 'special interests' in the DSM-5."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monotropism theory suggests the Autistic mind tends to focus intensely on a narrow range of interests (an 'attention tunnel'), whereas neurotypical (polytropic) minds tend to spread attention more broadly across multiple stimuli."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is engaged in social masking/camouflaging. While it allows her to navigate the workplace, the high cognitive load required to consciously perform social behaviors leads to extreme fatigue and eventual burnout."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Individuals with hypersensitivity (sensory avoiders) have a 'sensory cup' that fills up quickly. Small, repetitive stimuli (like a humming fridge or bright lights) can accumulate until the individual reaches a breaking point or meltdown."

                "Surprising the learner with the change to build 'resilience' through exposure.",
                "Providing a visual schedule and a 'transition bridge' (5-minute warning) to allow for cognitive shifting.",
                "Ignoring the rigidity and proceeding with the new task to avoid reinforcing the behavior.",
                "Asking the learner to explain why they are being rigid to encourage self-reflection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based strategies for cognitive rigidity involve predictability and preparation. Visual schedules and transition warnings help the individual 'shift' their attention tunnel to the new task."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "According to the CAT-Q (Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire), which of these is NOT one of the three main factors of masking?",
            "options": [
                "Compensation (strategies used to overcome social difficulties)",
                "Assimilation (trying to fit in with others in social situations)",
                "Masking (hiding autistic characteristics)",
                "Aggression (externalizing frustration with social norms)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The CAT-Q measures three factors: Compensation, Assimilation, and Masking. Aggression is not a component of the social camouflaging construct measured by this validated tool."

            "options": [
                "Vague, open-ended project descriptions to encourage creativity.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processors focus on details before the 'big picture.' Clear, explicit instructions and defined outcomes help bridge the gap between detailed tasks and the overall project goal, reducing cognitive load."
