    <h2>Module 35 Quiz: Master Practitioner Capstone</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p>1. A 52-year-old female presents with persistent fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Her TSH is elevated, and free T4 is low. She is already on levothyroxine 100mcg daily, but her symptoms persist. What is the MOST appropriate next step in managing her hypothyroidism, considering advanced functional medicine principles?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a">A) Increase her levothyroxine dosage by 25mcg.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b">B) Add a T3 medication (liothyronine) to her treatment regimen.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c">C) Order a full thyroid panel, including TPO and TgAb antibodies, reverse T3, and assess for nutrient deficiencies (selenium, zinc, iron).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d">D) Refer her to an endocrinologist for further evaluation.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: C</b>. While increasing levothyroxine or adding T3 might be considered, the MOST appropriate next step is a comprehensive thyroid panel to investigate potential underlying causes of her persistent symptoms despite medication. This includes autoimmune thyroiditis (TPO/TgAb), impaired T4 to T3 conversion (reverse T3), and nutrient deficiencies crucial for thyroid hormone synthesis and function. Referral might be necessary later if the underlying cause remains unclear.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. A 40-year-old male reports experiencing anxiety, insomnia, and palpitations. He also mentions frequent headaches and muscle tension. He works a high-stress job and consumes several cups of coffee daily. Which of the following would be the MOST comprehensive functional medicine approach to address his symptoms?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a">A) Prescribe an anxiolytic medication to manage his anxiety.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b">B) Recommend a magnesium supplement and advise him to reduce his caffeine intake.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c">C) Implement a comprehensive stress management program, including mindfulness techniques, adaptogenic herbs (e.g., Ashwagandha, Rhodiola), dietary modifications (reducing caffeine and processed foods), and gut health assessment.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d">D) Advise him to get more sleep and exercise regularly.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: C</b>. A comprehensive approach addresses the root causes of his symptoms. While magnesium and lifestyle changes are helpful, a holistic program encompassing stress management, adaptogens, dietary changes, and gut health assessment provides the most comprehensive and sustainable solution.  His caffeine intake is likely exacerbating his symptoms, and gut health plays a significant role in neurotransmitter production and anxiety.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>3. A 60-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is looking to improve his metabolic health. He is currently on metformin and a statin.  Beyond medication, what is the MOST important functional medicine intervention to recommend?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a">A) A strict ketogenic diet to rapidly lower blood sugar.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b">B) A personalized dietary plan focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, emphasizing fiber, lean protein, and healthy fats, combined with regular exercise (both aerobic and resistance training) and stress management techniques.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c">C) A high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program three times per week.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d">D) A daily dose of omega-3 fatty acids to improve cardiovascular health.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: B</b>. While other options have benefits, a personalized dietary plan combined with exercise and stress management provides the most comprehensive and sustainable approach to improve metabolic health. A ketogenic diet might be too restrictive and difficult to maintain long-term. HIIT is beneficial but should be part of a broader exercise plan. Omega-3s are helpful but not the most crucial intervention.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>4. A 35-year-old female presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues (bloating, gas). She has been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and has tried various medications without significant relief.  What is the MOST appropriate initial functional medicine investigation?</p>

        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: A</b>. While the other options might be considered later, a comprehensive stool analysis is the MOST appropriate initial investigation. It can identify dysbiosis, inflammation, and digestive enzyme deficiencies, providing valuable insights into the root causes of her IBS and guiding targeted interventions. A low-FODMAP diet is often helpful but doesn't address underlying imbalances.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>5. A 48-year-old male presents with declining cognitive function, including memory loss and difficulty concentrating. He has a family history of Alzheimer's disease. Which of the following is the MOST comprehensive functional medicine approach to assess and manage his cognitive decline?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a">A) Prescribe a cholinesterase inhibitor medication.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b">B) Recommend a brain-training app to improve cognitive function.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c">C) Conduct a comprehensive assessment including cognitive testing, blood work (inflammation markers, homocysteine, vitamin D, APOE genotype), evaluate for insulin resistance, assess gut health, and implement a personalized plan addressing modifiable risk factors such as diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d">D) Advise him to take a Ginkgo biloba supplement.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: C</b>. A comprehensive assessment is crucial to identify underlying causes and modifiable risk factors. While medication and supplements might have a role, a personalized plan addressing diet, exercise, sleep, stress, and other modifiable factors offers the most comprehensive approach to managing cognitive decline and potentially slowing disease progression. APOE genotype gives insight into genetic predisposition.
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6. A 28-year-old female is struggling with infertility. She has regular menstrual cycles but has been unable to conceive after 18 months of trying.  What is the MOST comprehensive initial functional medicine workup?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a">A) Refer her directly for IVF.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b">B) Assess her hormone levels (FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, AMH), thyroid function, vitamin D, and screen for underlying conditions like PCOS or endometriosis. Also assess the partner's sperm analysis.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c">C) Recommend she start taking prenatal vitamins.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d">D) Advise her to track her ovulation cycle more closely.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: B</b>. A comprehensive hormonal assessment, thyroid evaluation, vitamin D level, and screening for underlying conditions are crucial to identify potential causes of infertility.  Partner sperm analysis is equally important.  Referral for IVF might be necessary later, but a thorough initial workup is essential.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>7. A patient undergoing chemotherapy for cancer is experiencing significant side effects, including nausea, fatigue, and mucositis. What is the MOST appropriate functional medicine approach to support them?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a">A) Prescribe anti-nausea medication and advise them to rest.</label>

Gut health and food sensitivities can contribute to inflammation.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>9. You have a patient with a known MTHFR gene mutation. They are experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and fatigue. How would you BEST manage this patient using functional medicine principles?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a">A) Immediately start them on high doses of folic acid.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b">B) Prescribe an antidepressant medication.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c">C) Assess their homocysteine levels, consider supplementing with methylfolate and other B vitamins, address gut health, and optimize their diet to support methylation. Also, evaluate for other potential contributing factors to their symptoms.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d">D) Tell them the MTHFR mutation is insignificant and their symptoms are unrelated.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: C</b>. While MTHFR mutations don't always cause problems, in symptomatic individuals, supporting methylation is key. Methylfolate is the active form of folate and bypasses the need for the MTHFR enzyme. Addressing gut health is crucial as it impacts nutrient absorption. High doses of folic acid are generally avoided, as they can interfere with methylfolate metabolism.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
