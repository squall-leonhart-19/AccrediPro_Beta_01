    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #666;">Expert Case Analysis</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>1. A 45-year-old female presents with persistent fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Initial labs show elevated TSH and normal T4. She reports significant stress due to caring for her elderly mother. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in her functional medicine evaluation?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> A) Prescribe a standard dose of levothyroxine.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> B) Order a complete thyroid panel including T3, reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies (TPO and TgAb).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> C) Recommend a low-calorie diet and increased exercise.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> D) Immediately refer her to an endocrinologist.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> While elevated TSH suggests hypothyroidism, normal T4 doesn't rule out subclinical hypothyroidism or conversion issues. A complete thyroid panel (T3, reverse T3, antibodies) is crucial to understand the full picture, especially considering the patient's stress levels, which can impact thyroid hormone conversion. Ruling out Hashimoto's is critical. Option A is premature without a full understanding of the thyroid axis. Option C addresses symptoms but not the root cause. Option D might be necessary later, but further investigation is warranted first.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. A 60-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presents with new-onset erectile dysfunction. He is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Beyond standard medical management, which functional medicine approach is MOST likely to improve his erectile function?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> A) Prescribing a high-dose vitamin D supplement.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> B) Focusing on gut microbiome optimization and reducing inflammation through diet and targeted supplementation.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> C) Recommending testosterone replacement therapy without further investigation.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> D) Suggesting he try over-the-counter herbal remedies.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Erectile dysfunction in this context is likely multifactorial, related to endothelial dysfunction from diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammation contribute significantly to endothelial dysfunction. Addressing the root cause through gut microbiome optimization (prebiotics, probiotics, dietary changes) and inflammation reduction is the most comprehensive approach. Vitamin D (A) can be helpful, but less directly impactful. Testosterone (C) should only be considered after thorough evaluation. Herbal remedies (D) lack consistent evidence and quality control.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>3. A 32-year-old female presents with complaints of brain fog, fatigue, and digestive issues (bloating, gas) after a recent course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for a sinus infection. Which functional medicine test would provide the MOST actionable information in guiding her treatment plan?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> A) A comprehensive stool analysis with dysbiosis markers and pathogen identification.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> B) A food sensitivity test (IgG antibodies).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> C) A heavy metal toxicity test.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> D) A hormone panel (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone).</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: A</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> The antibiotic course strongly suggests gut dysbiosis as the primary driver of her symptoms. A comprehensive stool analysis will identify specific imbalances, opportunistic pathogens, and markers of inflammation, guiding targeted interventions like probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary changes. Food sensitivity tests (B) are often misinterpreted and less reliable. Heavy metal toxicity (C) is less likely in this scenario. Hormones (D) might be relevant long-term, but addressing the gut should be the initial focus.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>4. A 50-year-old male reports difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. He works a high-stress job and drinks 2-3 cups of coffee daily. He has tried melatonin with minimal benefit. What is the MOST comprehensive functional medicine approach to address his insomnia?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> A) Prescribing a stronger sleep aid.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> B) Recommending a sleep hygiene checklist and continuing melatonin.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> C) Assessing adrenal function (cortisol awakening response, diurnal cortisol curve), evaluating neurotransmitter levels (serotonin, GABA), and addressing lifestyle factors (caffeine, stress management).</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> D) Suggesting he try meditation before bed.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: C</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Insomnia is often multifactorial. Assessing adrenal function and neurotransmitter levels can identify underlying imbalances contributing to sleep disruption. Addressing lifestyle factors (caffeine, stress) is crucial. A stronger sleep aid (A) is a band-aid solution. Sleep hygiene (B) is important but may not be sufficient. Meditation (D) is helpful but needs to be part of a broader strategy.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>5. A 28-year-old female presents with acne, hirsutism, and irregular menstrual cycles. She is diagnosed with PCOS. Beyond conventional medical treatment, which of the following functional medicine interventions should be prioritized?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> A) Focus solely on topical acne treatments.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> B) Implement a low-glycemic diet, address insulin resistance with targeted supplements (e.g., inositol, berberine), and support liver detoxification.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> C) Prescribe a high-dose biotin supplement.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d"> D) Recommend cosmetic procedures for hair removal.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> PCOS is primarily driven by insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances. Addressing insulin resistance through diet and supplementation is fundamental. Supporting liver detoxification helps with hormone metabolism. Topical acne treatments (A) address symptoms but not the root cause. Biotin (C) is not specifically indicated for PCOS. Cosmetic procedures (D) are symptomatic treatments.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6. A 70-year-old male presents with progressive memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and decreased cognitive function. He has a family history of Alzheimer's disease. Which functional medicine assessment would be MOST valuable in identifying potentially modifiable risk factors?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> A) A comprehensive neurological examination.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> B) Assessment of homocysteine levels, vitamin B12 status, inflammatory markers (hs-CRP), and APOE genotype.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c"> C) A standard blood panel including CBC and CMP.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d"> D) A brain MRI to rule out structural abnormalities.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> While a neurological exam (A) and brain MRI (D) are important, assessing homocysteine, B12, inflammatory markers, and APOE genotype identifies modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. Elevated homocysteine and low B12 can impair brain function. Inflammation contributes to neurodegeneration. APOE genotype provides information about genetic predisposition. Standard blood panel (C) provides limited information in this context.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

   <div class="question">
        <p>7. A 35-year-old patient presents with chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. She has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Which of the following functional medicine approaches is MOST likely to provide long-term relief?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> A) Prescribing opioid pain medication.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> B) Focusing on gut health, addressing mitochondrial dysfunction, and managing stress through mindfulness and exercise.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> C) Recommending over-the-counter pain relievers as needed.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="d"> D) Suggesting she simply learn to live with the pain.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Fibromyalgia is often associated with gut dysbiosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and heightened stress response. Addressing these underlying factors through gut health optimization, mitochondrial support, and stress management is crucial for long-term relief. Opioids (A) are not recommended due to their addictive potential and limited efficacy. Over-the-counter pain relievers (C) provide only temporary relief. Telling the patient to "live with the pain" (D) is dismissive and unhelpful.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>8. A 40-year-old male reports persistent heartburn, bloating, and indigestion after meals. He has been taking PPIs for several years with minimal improvement. What is the MOST appropriate functional medicine investigation to determine the root cause of his symptoms?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> A) An upper endoscopy to rule out structural abnormalities.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> B) A SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) breath test and a comprehensive stool analysis to assess gut microbiome and digestive function.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="c"> C) Continuing the PPIs and adding an H2 blocker.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="d"> D) Recommending a gluten-free diet.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Persistent heartburn despite PPI use suggests underlying issues like SIBO or impaired digestive function. A SIBO breath test and comprehensive stool analysis are essential to identify these factors. Endoscopy (A) is important for ruling out structural issues but doesn't address functional problems. Continuing PPIs (C) without addressing the root cause is not a sustainable solution. A gluten-free diet (D) may be helpful for some, but targeted testing is necessary first.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>9. A 55-year-old woman is experiencing hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. She is hesitant to use hormone replacement therapy. Which of the following functional medicine approaches would be MOST appropriate for managing her menopausal symptoms?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> A) Prescribing a high dose of black cohosh.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> B) Assessing hormone levels (estradiol, FSH, LH), evaluating adrenal function, and recommending dietary and lifestyle modifications, including phytoestrogens and stress management techniques.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c"> C) Telling her to simply deal with the symptoms as they are a natural part of aging.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d"> D) Suggesting over-the-counter lubricants for vaginal dryness.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> A comprehensive approach is needed. Assessing hormone levels and adrenal function helps identify imbalances contributing to symptoms. Dietary and lifestyle modifications, including phytoestrogens (e.g., soy, flaxseed) and stress management, can provide significant relief. Black cohosh (A) can be helpful but may not be sufficient. Dismissing the symptoms (C) is inappropriate. Lubricants (D) address only one symptom.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>10. A 48-year-old male presents with chronic fatigue, muscle aches, and cognitive difficulties following a confirmed case of Lyme disease treated with antibiotics. He continues to test negative for Lyme on standard testing. Which functional medicine strategy would be MOST appropriate to address his persistent symptoms?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="a"> A) Prescribing another course of antibiotics.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="b"> B) Focusing on immune modulation, mitochondrial support, and detoxification pathways to address post-Lyme syndrome.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="c"> C) Recommending a very restrictive diet to eliminate potential food sensitivities.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="d"> D) Ignoring his symptoms since he tested negative for Lyme.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Post-Lyme syndrome (also known as chronic Lyme disease or Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome) often involves persistent immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired detoxification. Addressing these factors through immune modulation (e.g., adaptogens, botanical medicines), mitochondrial support (e.g., CoQ10, PQQ), and detoxification support is crucial. Further antibiotics (A) are not indicated. Restrictive diets (C) can be detrimental without proper guidance. Ignoring the symptoms (D) is inappropriate.</p>
