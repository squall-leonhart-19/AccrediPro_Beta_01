    <div class="question">
        <p>1. A 68-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation is stabilized on warfarin. He starts taking a St. John's Wort supplement for mild depression.  Which of the following is the MOST likely clinical consequence and what is the BEST immediate course of action?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> a) Increased risk of bleeding; immediately discontinue St. John's Wort and monitor INR daily.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> b) Decreased efficacy of warfarin, increasing risk of thromboembolic events; immediately discontinue St. John's Wort and increase warfarin dosage while monitoring INR closely.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> c) No significant interaction; continue both medications as prescribed.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> d) Increased risk of digoxin toxicity; immediately reduce digoxin dosage and monitor digoxin levels.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> St. John's Wort is a potent CYP3A4 inducer, which can significantly decrease warfarin levels, leading to subtherapeutic anticoagulation and increased risk of thromboembolic events.  The BEST course of action is to discontinue the St. John's Wort, increase the warfarin dosage (under close INR monitoring), and educate the patient on alternative treatments for depression that do not interact with warfarin.  Option A is incorrect because St. John’s Wort decreases warfarin effectiveness, not increases bleeding.  Option C is incorrect because there is a significant interaction.  Option D is incorrect because St. John's Wort primarily interacts with CYP enzymes, not digoxin.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. A 55-year-old female with type 2 diabetes managed with metformin complains of increasing gastrointestinal distress, including bloating and diarrhea. She recently started taking a chromium supplement to improve insulin sensitivity. How should you advise her regarding the chromium supplement?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> a) Continue the chromium supplement as prescribed; the GI distress is likely unrelated.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> b) Discontinue the chromium supplement immediately, as it can exacerbate metformin-induced GI side effects.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> c) Reduce the dose of metformin; chromium does not interact with metformin.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> d) Reduce the dose of chromium and monitor blood glucose levels closely, as chromium can potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of metformin.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: d)</b> Chromium can enhance insulin sensitivity, potentially leading to hypoglycemia when combined with metformin.  While GI distress can be a side effect of metformin, chromium can potentiate its hypoglycemic effect, requiring careful monitoring of blood glucose and potential dose adjustments of either metformin or chromium. Reducing chromium dosage is the safest initial approach. Option B is too drastic without further investigation. Option A is incorrect as there is a potential interaction. Option C is incorrect because chromium *can* interact with metformin, potentiating its effects.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>3. A 70-year-old male with osteoporosis is prescribed alendronate (a bisphosphonate). He also takes a calcium supplement and a multivitamin containing iron. What specific instructions should you provide to maximize the absorption of alendronate?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> a) Take alendronate, calcium, and the multivitamin all together in the morning to improve compliance.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> b) Take alendronate at bedtime to minimize GI upset, separating it from other medications.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> c) Take alendronate first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with water, waiting at least 30 minutes before taking calcium or the multivitamin.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> d) Alendronate absorption is not affected by other medications or supplements; timing is not important.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: c)</b> Alendronate absorption is significantly reduced by calcium, iron, and other divalent cations. It should be taken on an empty stomach with water, and patients should wait at least 30 minutes (preferably longer) before consuming calcium supplements, multivitamins containing iron, or other medications. Options A and B are incorrect because they do not address the absorption interference. Option D is incorrect because alendronate absorption *is* affected.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>4. A patient taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism starts a high-fiber diet and a psyllium husk supplement for constipation. What potential impact could this have on their thyroid hormone levels, and how should you monitor this?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> a) The high-fiber diet and psyllium will increase levothyroxine absorption, potentially leading to hyperthyroidism; monitor TSH levels and adjust levothyroxine dose accordingly.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> b) The high-fiber diet and psyllium will decrease levothyroxine absorption, potentially leading to hypothyroidism; monitor TSH levels and adjust levothyroxine dose accordingly.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> c) The high-fiber diet and psyllium will have no significant impact on levothyroxine absorption.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> d) The high-fiber diet will increase T3 production, while psyllium will have no effect; monitor T3 levels.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> Fiber, including psyllium husk, can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially leading to hypothyroidism. TSH levels should be monitored, and the levothyroxine dose may need to be increased. Option A is incorrect because fiber decreases absorption. Option C is incorrect because there is a potential impact. Option D is incorrect because fiber affects absorption, not T3 production.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>5. A patient on a stable dose of lisinopril for hypertension begins taking a licorice root supplement for adrenal support. What potential interaction should you be concerned about and how would you monitor for it?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> a) Licorice root can increase the efficacy of lisinopril, leading to hypotension; monitor blood pressure regularly.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> b) Licorice root can decrease the efficacy of lisinopril, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia; monitor blood pressure and potassium levels.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> c) Licorice root can cause hyperkalemia, potentiating the potassium-sparing effect of lisinopril; monitor potassium levels.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d"> d) There is no significant interaction between licorice root and lisinopril.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> Licorice root contains glycyrrhizic acid, which can mimic aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention, potassium loss (hypokalemia), and increased blood pressure. This can antagonize the effects of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor. Monitoring blood pressure and potassium levels is crucial. Option A is incorrect because licorice increases blood pressure. Option C is incorrect because licorice causes hypokalemia. Option D is incorrect because there is a significant interaction.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6. A patient taking simvastatin for hyperlipidemia starts consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice daily. What is the MOST likely consequence of this interaction and what specific advice should you give the patient?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> a) Decreased simvastatin levels, leading to increased LDL cholesterol; advise the patient to increase their simvastatin dose.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> b) Increased simvastatin levels, leading to increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; advise the patient to avoid grapefruit juice entirely.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c"> c) No significant interaction; grapefruit juice has no effect on simvastatin metabolism.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d"> d) Decreased absorption of simvastatin, leading to GI upset; advise the patient to take simvastatin on an empty stomach.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4, an enzyme responsible for metabolizing simvastatin. This leads to increased simvastatin levels in the blood, increasing the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. The patient should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice entirely while taking simvastatin. Option A is incorrect because grapefruit juice increases, not decreases, simvastatin levels. Option C is incorrect because there *is* a significant interaction. Option D is incorrect because grapefruit juice affects metabolism, not absorption.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>7. A patient taking a MAOI (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor) for depression is considering taking a Tyrosine supplement to further improve mood and energy. What is the MOST concerning potential interaction and what education should be provided?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> a) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome; advise against combining Tyrosine with an MAOI.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> b) Hypertensive crisis due to increased levels of tyramine; advise against combining Tyrosine with an MAOI and educate about tyramine-rich foods.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> c) Increased risk of hypoglycemia; monitor blood glucose levels closely.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="d"> d) Tyrosine will reduce the effectiveness of the MAOI; advise against combining them.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> MAOIs inhibit the breakdown of tyramine in the gut and other tissues. Tyrosine is a precursor to tyramine. Combining Tyrosine supplementation with an MAOI can lead to a dangerous accumulation of tyramine, resulting in a hypertensive crisis. The patient should be strongly advised against this combination and educated about avoiding tyramine-rich foods as well. Option A is more associated with SSRIs. Option C is incorrect because there is no direct link to hypoglycemia. Option D is incorrect; the main concern is the hypertensive crisis, not reduced MAOI efficacy.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>8. A patient is taking cyclosporine following an organ transplant. They are also taking a milk thistle supplement to support liver health. What is the potential interaction, and what monitoring is necessary?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> a) Milk thistle will increase cyclosporine levels, potentially leading to toxicity; monitor cyclosporine levels and kidney function.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> b) Milk thistle will decrease cyclosporine levels, potentially leading to organ rejection; monitor cyclosporine levels and organ function.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="c"> c) Milk thistle will cause liver damage, counteracting the potential benefits of cyclosporine; monitor liver enzymes.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="d"> d) There is no significant interaction between milk thistle and cyclosporine.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> Milk thistle can induce CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, which are involved in the metabolism and transport of cyclosporine. This can lead to decreased cyclosporine levels, potentially increasing the risk of organ rejection. Monitoring cyclosporine levels and organ function is crucial. Option A is less likely, as milk thistle is generally an inducer. Option C is incorrect, milk thistle is generally hepatoprotective. Option D is incorrect because there is a potential interaction, though the exact effect can vary.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>9. A patient on oral contraceptives starts taking a high-dose Vitamin C supplement. What potential interaction might occur, and what advice is most appropriate?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> a) Vitamin C will decrease the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive; advise the patient to use backup contraception.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> b) Vitamin C will increase estrogen levels, potentially leading to increased side effects; advise the patient to reduce their Vitamin C intake.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c"> c) Vitamin C will interfere with iron absorption, leading to anemia; advise the patient to take an iron supplement.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d"> d) There is no significant interaction between Vitamin C and oral contraceptives.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: b)</b> High doses of Vitamin C can interfere with the metabolism of estrogen, potentially increasing estrogen levels and leading to increased side effects such as nausea, breast tenderness, and mood changes. The patient should be advised to reduce their Vitamin C intake to see if this alleviates the side effects. Option A is less likely, although some older studies suggested this, it is not the primary concern. Option C is incorrect as this is not the primary interaction. While Vitamin C can enhance iron absorption, this is not the main concern in this scenario. Option D is incorrect as there can be an interaction.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>10. A patient taking lithium for bipolar disorder starts taking an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) for chronic pain. What potential interaction should you be aware of, and how would you monitor for it?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="a"> a) NSAIDs can increase lithium levels, potentially leading to lithium toxicity; monitor lithium levels and watch for signs of toxicity.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="b"> b) NSAIDs can decrease lithium levels, potentially leading to a relapse of bipolar symptoms; monitor lithium levels and mood.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="c"> c) NSAIDs will increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients taking lithium; monitor for signs of GI bleeding.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="d"> d) There is no significant interaction between NSAIDs and lithium.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p><b>Correct Answer: a)</b> NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow, leading to decreased lithium excretion and increased lithium levels in the blood. This can increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Lithium levels should be monitored closely, and the patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, confusion). Option B is incorrect because NSAIDs increase, not decrease, lithium levels. Option C is a general concern with NSAIDs, but the primary concern here is lithium toxicity. Option D is incorrect because there is a significant interaction.</p>
