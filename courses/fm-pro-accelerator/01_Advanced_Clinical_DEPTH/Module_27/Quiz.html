    <div class="question accredi-pro-question">
        <p>1. Case Study: A 45-year-old female presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her primary care physician (PCP) has prescribed levothyroxine based on a TSH of 6.0 mIU/L. Despite being on levothyroxine (75 mcg daily) for 3 months, her symptoms persist, and her TSH is now 4.0 mIU/L. As an advanced FM practitioner, what is the MOST appropriate next step in collaborating with her PCP?</p>
        <div class="options accredi-pro-option">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> A) Recommend increasing the levothyroxine dosage to 100 mcg daily and retesting TSH in 6 weeks without consulting the PCP.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> B) Contact the PCP to discuss a trial of T3/T4 combination therapy, citing potential T4 to T3 conversion issues and the patient's persistent symptoms.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> C) Advise the patient to discontinue levothyroxine and start on a natural thyroid supplement.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> D) Order a full thyroid panel including TPO antibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies, and reverse T3 without informing the PCP.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation accredi-pro-explanation">
            <b>Correct Answer: B</b>.  This scenario highlights the importance of collaborative management of thyroid conditions. While levothyroxine addresses T4 levels, some patients may have difficulty converting T4 to the more active T3. Discussing combination therapy with the PCP allows for a coordinated approach. Increasing levothyroxine without consultation or switching to supplements without medical oversight is inappropriate.  A full thyroid panel can be useful, but it's best to discuss ordering it with the PCP to avoid conflicting management plans.
