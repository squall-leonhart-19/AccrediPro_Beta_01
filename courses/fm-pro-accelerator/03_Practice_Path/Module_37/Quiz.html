    <h2>FM Pro Accelerator - DEPTH MASTERY™: Module 37 - Ethical Client Acquisition Quiz</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p>1. Dr. Anya Sharma, a functional medicine practitioner, wants to attract more clients. She creates an online advertisement claiming her unique treatment protocol can cure 95% of all autoimmune diseases. Which ethical principle is she MOST likely violating?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> a) Autonomy</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> b) Beneficence</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> c) Non-maleficence</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> d) Veracity</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: d) Veracity.  Veracity refers to truthfulness and honesty. Making unsubstantiated claims about a guaranteed cure violates this principle.  Such claims are often misleading and lack scientific backing, potentially exploiting vulnerable individuals seeking solutions for chronic conditions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. A functional medicine practice offers a "free" introductory consultation. However, during the consultation, the practitioner aggressively pushes a comprehensive (and expensive) testing package, implying it's necessary to even begin addressing the client's concerns. This tactic is BEST described as:</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> a) Informed Consent</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> b) Bait-and-Switch</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> c) Value-based Marketing</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> d) Needs-based Selling</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: b) Bait-and-Switch. This is a deceptive tactic where an attractive but ultimately unavailable offer (the "free" consultation) is used to lure customers in, only to be pressured into buying something else. True informed consent is absent, and the consultation is primarily used for sales, not genuine assessment.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>3.  Your practice uses testimonials on its website. Which of the following actions is MOST important to ensure ethical compliance?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> a) Ensuring all testimonials are from current clients.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> b) Guaranteeing the results mentioned in the testimonials for all future clients.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> c) Obtaining written consent from clients before using their testimonials and disclosing if payment or incentives were provided.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> d) Editing testimonials to make them more impactful and persuasive.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: c) Obtaining written consent from clients before using their testimonials and disclosing if payment or incentives were provided.  Ethical guidelines require informed consent for using testimonials. Transparency about any incentives is crucial to avoid misleading potential clients. Testimonials should be authentic and not edited in a way that misrepresents the client's experience.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>4.  A practitioner partners with a supplement company and receives a commission for every supplement sold through their practice. What is the MOST ethical way to handle this relationship?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> a) Avoid disclosing the relationship to clients to prevent any perceived bias.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> b) Only recommend supplements from that company, regardless of client needs.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> c) Disclose the financial relationship to clients and ensure supplement recommendations are based solely on their individual needs and evidence-based research.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> d) Offer the supplements at a significantly discounted price to compensate for the commission.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: c) Disclose the financial relationship to clients and ensure supplement recommendations are based solely on their individual needs and evidence-based research. Transparency is key.  Clients have a right to know about potential conflicts of interest.  Recommendations must always be driven by the client's best interest and supported by scientific evidence, not financial incentives.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

     <div class="question">
        <p>5.  You are running a social media campaign to attract new clients. Which of the following posts is MOST likely to be considered unethical?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> a) "Learn how functional medicine can optimize your health and well-being."</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> b) "Tired of feeling tired? Our personalized protocols can help you reclaim your energy!"</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> c) "Dr. Smith's revolutionary treatment completely eradicated a patient's stage IV cancer! (Results not typical)"</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="d"> d) "Download our free guide to gut health and discover the power of functional medicine."</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: c) "Dr. Smith's revolutionary treatment completely eradicated a patient's stage IV cancer! (Results not typical)".  This post is highly problematic.  Even with the disclaimer, it creates unrealistic expectations and preys on the vulnerability of individuals facing serious illnesses. It's crucial to avoid making unsubstantiated claims or implying guaranteed cures, especially in emotionally charged situations.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6.  A potential client contacts your practice after seeing an advertisement for a specific treatment you offer. During the initial consultation, you realize that the treatment is unlikely to be effective for their particular condition, but you know other services you offer could be beneficial. What is the MOST ethical course of action?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="a"> a) Proceed with the advertised treatment, as that's what the client is expecting.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="b"> b) Explain why the advertised treatment is unlikely to be effective and recommend the more suitable alternative, even if it's more expensive.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="c"> c) Briefly mention the alternative treatment but focus on selling the advertised treatment, as it's easier to market.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="d"> d) Refer the client to another practitioner who specializes in the advertised treatment.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: b) Explain why the advertised treatment is unlikely to be effective and recommend the more suitable alternative, even if it's more expensive.  The client's well-being should always be the priority. Open and honest communication about treatment options and their potential effectiveness is crucial. Prioritizing the client's needs over immediate financial gain builds trust and strengthens the practitioner-patient relationship.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>7.  You're designing a lead magnet (e.g., a free ebook) to attract potential clients. Which of the following statements is MOST important to include in the disclaimer/legal section?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="a"> a) "This ebook is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Consult with a qualified healthcare professional for personalized recommendations."</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="b"> b) "This ebook contains the secret to perfect health. Follow our advice and you'll feel amazing!"</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="c"> c) "We are not responsible for any adverse effects resulting from following the advice in this ebook."</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="d"> d) "All rights reserved. No part of this ebook may be reproduced without permission."</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: a) "This ebook is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. Consult with a qualified healthcare professional for personalized recommendations." This statement is essential to avoid creating a patient-practitioner relationship and to emphasize that the information provided is not a substitute for personalized medical advice. It protects both the practitioner and the user.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>8.  Your practice is considering using influencer marketing to reach a wider audience. Which of the following practices is MOST important to ensure ethical compliance?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="a"> a) Providing influencers with a script to read verbatim to ensure consistent messaging.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="b"> b) Allowing influencers to make any claims they want about your services, as long as it generates leads.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="c"> c) Ensuring influencers clearly disclose their partnership with your practice and that any claims they make are truthful, substantiated, and aligned with ethical guidelines.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="d"> d) Paying influencers based solely on the number of leads they generate, regardless of the quality of those leads.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: c) Ensuring influencers clearly disclose their partnership with your practice and that any claims they make are truthful, substantiated, and aligned with ethical guidelines. Transparency is paramount. Influencers must disclose their relationship with your practice to maintain credibility and avoid misleading their audience.  You are responsible for ensuring that their claims are accurate and ethical, even though they are a third party.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>9.  A client posts a negative review of your practice online, claiming your treatment made their condition worse. What is the MOST ethical way to respond?</p>
        <div class="options">
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="a"> a) Publicly refute the review, providing specific details about the client's case to defend your practice.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="b"> b) Ignore the review, as responding might draw more attention to it.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="c"> c) Respond politely and professionally, acknowledging the client's concerns and offering to discuss the matter privately.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="d"> d) Contact the website administrator and request that the review be removed.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: c) Respond politely and professionally, acknowledging the client's concerns and offering to discuss the matter privately.  Maintaining professionalism is crucial. Publicly disclosing details of a client's case would violate privacy and confidentiality.  A respectful response shows that you value client feedback and are willing to address concerns. Taking the conversation offline allows for a more private and constructive discussion.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>10. Your practice is considering using automated email marketing to nurture leads. Which of the following is the MOST important ethical consideration?</p>

            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="b"> b) Ensuring all emails are personalized with the recipient's name.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="c"> c) Providing a clear and easy way for recipients to unsubscribe from future emails.</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="d"> d) Tracking which emails are opened and which links are clicked.</label>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p class="correct">Correct Answer: c) Providing a clear and easy way for recipients to unsubscribe from future emails. Respecting the recipient's autonomy is paramount.  Providing an unsubscribe option is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and demonstrates respect for their choice.  Failing to do so can be considered spam and damage your practice's reputation.</p>
