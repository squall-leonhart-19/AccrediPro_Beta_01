            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is synthesized within the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) and gut mucosa?",
            "options": ["10-15%", "45-50%", "70-75%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in the brain, roughly 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gut, where it regulates motility and signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is primarily responsible for providing the main energy source for colonocytes and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier?",
            "options": ["Acetate", "Propionate", "Butyrate", "Succinate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel source for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes). It plays a critical role in gene expression, cell differentiation, and maintaining tight junction integrity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In the context of intestinal permeability, which protein is currently the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions used as a clinical biomarker for 'leaky gut'?",
            "options": ["Zonulin", "Occludin", "Claudin-1", "Actin"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract wall. Elevated levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "During chronic systemic inflammation, tryptophan is often diverted away from serotonin synthesis and into which pathway, potentially leading to symptoms of anxiety and depression?",
            "options": ["The Melatonin Pathway", "The Kynurenine Pathway", "The Glutamate Cycle", "The GABA Shunt"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the enzyme IDO, which shunts tryptophan into the Kynurenine pathway. This reduces serotonin production and increases neurotoxic metabolites like quinolinic acid."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the primary role of Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) in the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": ["To produce IgE antibodies against parasites", "To trigger acute inflammatory responses to all bacteria", "To promote oral tolerance and suppress overactive immune responses", "To secrete hydrochloric acid in the stomach"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tregs are essential for maintaining 'oral tolerance,' ensuring the immune system does not overreact to harmless food proteins or commensal bacteria."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "According to the ISAPP consensus definition, what are 'Postbiotics'?",
            "options": ["Live microorganisms that confer a health benefit", "Non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial bacteria", "Preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit", "The waste products of pathogenic bacteria that cause disease"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postbiotics refer to non-viable (inanimate) bacterial cells, cell constituents, or metabolites (like SCFAs) that provide a physiological benefit to the host."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of 'estrogen dominance.' Which microbial enzyme, produced by the estrobolome, should a coach consider as a factor in the recirculation of estrogen?",
            "options": ["Amylase", "Beta-glucuronidase", "Lipase", "Protease"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When comparing microbiome testing methods, what is the primary advantage of Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing over 16S rRNA sequencing?",
            "options": ["It is significantly less expensive", "It only detects bacteria, not fungi or viruses", "It provides species-level resolution and functional gene profiling", "It can be performed in a home kitchen setting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shotgun Metagenomics sequences all the DNA in a sample, allowing for species and strain-level identification and an analysis of what the microbes are actually doing (functional capacity)."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia is characterized by the translocation of which substance from the gut into systemic circulation?",
            "options": ["Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)", "Short-Chain Fatty Acids", "Vitamin B12", "Digestive Enzymes"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LPS are endotoxins found in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria. When the gut barrier is compromised, LPS enters the blood, triggering low-grade systemic inflammation linked to insulin resistance and obesity."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A stool test result shows a significantly elevated 'Fecal Calprotectin' level (e.g., >200 µg/g). What does this most likely indicate?",
            "options": ["A lack of dietary fiber intake", "Excellent microbiome diversity", "Active intestinal inflammation, requiring clinical referral", "A normal response to probiotic supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a protein marker of neutrophil-driven inflammation in the gut. High levels are strongly associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) or significant infection and require medical follow-up."
