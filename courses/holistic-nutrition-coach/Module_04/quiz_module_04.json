            "question": "The Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is a distinct pattern of electromechanical activity in the GI tract. Which statement accurately describes its function?",
            "options": [
                "It occurs primarily during the postprandial (fed) state to mix chyme with enzymes.",
                "It is a four-phase cycle that occurs during fasting to 'sweep' undigested debris and bacteria into the colon.",
                "It is regulated entirely by the central nervous system with no input from the enteric nervous system.",
                "It is responsible for the secretion of bile from the gallbladder during fat ingestion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC is the 'housekeeping' wave of the digestive tract that occurs during fasting (interdigestive state). It prevents bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine by sweeping debris toward the colon."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C significantly enhances the absorption of non-heme iron by preventing the formation of insoluble iron compounds and reducing iron to its ferrous form."
