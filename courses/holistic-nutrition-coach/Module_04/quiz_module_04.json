            "question": "According to the principles of Circadian Biology discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary function of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)?",
            "options": [
                "To regulate the digestion of complex carbohydrates in the small intestine",
                "To act as the master pacemaker, synchronizing peripheral clocks via light signals from the retina",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN, located in the hypothalamus, serves as the body's master biological clock, receiving light input from the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells to coordinate the timing of physiological processes."

                "Planned high-intensity exercise is more effective for metabolic health than high levels of NEAT",
                "NEAT can vary by up to 2,000 kcal per day between individuals and is a primary determinant of weight maintenance",
                "NEAT only includes activities like swimming, cycling, and resistance training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NEAT encompasses all energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. It is a major variable in TDEE and crucial for long-term metabolic alignment."
