        {
            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic differentiating acute inflammation from chronic inflammation?",
            "options": ["Presence of immune cells", "Tissue repair", "Rapid onset and short duration", "Vasodilation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acute inflammation is characterized by its rapid onset and short duration, typically resolving within days or weeks. Chronic inflammation persists for months or years."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with persistent fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes. Based on these symptoms, which of the following dietary approaches would be MOST appropriate to initially investigate?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate diet", "Elimination diet focusing on common food sensitivities", "Strict ketogenic diet", "High-protein diet with added supplements"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the symptoms, an elimination diet targeting common food sensitivities (gluten, dairy, soy, etc.) is a logical first step to identify potential triggers of inflammation."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to research, which omega-6 fatty acid, when consumed in excess relative to omega-3 fatty acids, is MOST likely to promote inflammation?",
            "options": ["Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)", "Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)", "Arachidonic acid (ARA)", "Linoleic acid (LA)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arachidonic acid (ARA) is a precursor to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. An imbalanced ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, with excess omega-6, can exacerbate inflammation."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary function of the innate immune system?",
            "options": ["Recognizing and responding to pathogens", "Producing antibodies", "Activating the adaptive immune system", "Initiating inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antibody production is a function of the adaptive immune system, not the innate immune system. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, reports frequent upper respiratory infections. You suspect immune dysregulation. Which nutrient is MOST directly involved in maintaining the integrity of mucosal barriers, a key component of immune defense?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Vitamin C", "Vitamin A", "Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of mucosal barriers in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which act as a first line of defense against pathogens."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which probiotics are thought to influence the immune system?",
            "options": ["Directly killing pathogens", "Modulating the gut microbiota and promoting a balanced immune response", "Increasing stomach acid production", "Blocking nutrient absorption"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Probiotics influence the immune system primarily by modulating the gut microbiota, which in turn affects immune cell development and function. A balanced gut microbiota is associated with a healthy immune response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle factors has the MOST significant impact on chronic low-grade inflammation, as evidenced by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels?",
            "options": ["Moderate exercise", "Regular meditation", "Smoking", "Adequate sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Smoking is strongly associated with increased CRP levels and systemic inflammation. Studies consistently show a dose-dependent relationship between smoking and inflammatory markers."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of cytokines in the inflammatory response?",
            "options": ["Structural components of cell membranes", "Signaling molecules that mediate and regulate inflammation", "Enzymes that break down proteins", "Antioxidants that neutralize free radicals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cytokines are signaling molecules that play a crucial role in mediating and regulating the inflammatory response. They can be pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client is considering taking a turmeric supplement for its anti-inflammatory properties. What active compound in turmeric is primarily responsible for these effects?",
            "options": ["Gingerol", "Quercetin", "Capsaicin", "Curcumin"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Curcumin is the primary active compound in turmeric responsible for its anti-inflammatory properties. It exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms, including inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks its own tissues?",
            "options": ["Influenza", "Type 2 Diabetes", "Rheumatoid Arthritis", "Osteoarthritis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of the joints, causing inflammation and pain."
