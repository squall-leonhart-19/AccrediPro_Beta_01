            "question": "Research indicates that Glycemic Variability (GV) may be a more significant predictor of cardiovascular complications than HbA1c because:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While HbA1c measures average blood sugar, rapid fluctuations (spikes and crashes) are more damaging to the vascular endothelium due to the repeated induction of oxidative stress pathways."

            "question": "When evaluating protein quality for a client focused on hypertrophy, why is the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) preferred over the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)?",
            "options": [
                "DIAAS measures nitrogen balance in the urine rather than fecal matter.",
                "PDCAAS overestimates the quality of plant proteins by truncating scores at 1.0.",
                "DIAAS accounts for the anti-nutritional factors found only in animal proteins.",
                "PDCAAS does not consider the role of leucine in triggering the mTOR pathway."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDCAAS truncates scores at 1.0, masking the superior amino acid profiles of certain proteins. DIAAS provides a more accurate assessment of ileal digestibility and amino acid bioavailability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High zinc intake stimulates the synthesis of metallothionein, which has a higher affinity for copper than zinc, trapping copper in the intestinal cell and preventing its absorption."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is one of the most important Phase II pathways, involving the attachment of glucuronic acid to toxins (including estrogen and medications) to make them water-soluble for excretion."

                "He has reached the 'Leucine Threshold' and is maximizing muscle protein synthesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Negative nitrogen balance occurs when the body loses more nitrogen (a marker for protein) than it takes in, indicating tissue breakdown or inadequate nutrition."
