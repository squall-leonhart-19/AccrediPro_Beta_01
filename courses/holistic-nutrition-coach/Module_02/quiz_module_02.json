            "question": "When assessing systemic inflammation via high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), which serum level range is considered 'optimal' for cardiovascular and immune health according to the course methodology?",
            "options": [
                "< 1.0 mg/L",
                "1.0 - 3.0 mg/L",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While standard labs often flag levels above 3.0 mg/L as 'high risk,' holistic nutrition focuses on optimal health, where an hs-CRP below 1.0 mg/L indicates minimal systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-glycemic loads lead to the formation of AGEs, which bind to RAGE (Receptors for AGEs), fueling a cycle of chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "It increases the production of cortisol to suppress the immune system",
                "It converts into Vitamin C within the liver",
                "It stimulates the production of histamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quercetin is a potent zinc ionophore, meaning it helps move zinc across the cell membrane where it can interfere with the viral RNA polymerase enzyme."
