            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["A direct neural connection from the brain to the stomach.", "A bidirectional communication system involving the central nervous system, enteric nervous system, and gut microbiota.", "The influence of dietary fiber on cognitive function.", "The effect of probiotics on mood disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis is a complex, bidirectional communication network involving the central and enteric nervous systems, and gut microbiota. It influences both gastrointestinal and cognitive functions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lactase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. A deficiency in lactase can lead to bloating and gas after dairy consumption."

            "options": ["Approximately 20%", "Approximately 40%", "Approximately 60-70%", "Approximately 90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that a low-FODMAP diet can provide symptom relief for approximately 60-70% of individuals with IBS."

            "options": ["Abdominal bloating", "Excessive flatulence", "Weight gain", "Nutrient malabsorption"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SIBO is associated with bloating, gas, diarrhea, and nutrient malabsorption, often leading to weight loss or difficulty gaining weight, rather than weight gain."

            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, reports chronic fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. She suspects a link to her diet. Which dietary intervention would be MOST appropriate as an initial step, considering the information presented in the module?",
            "options": ["A strict ketogenic diet", "An elimination diet to identify potential food sensitivities", "A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet", "A juice cleanse"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet is a systematic approach to identifying food sensitivities that may be contributing to symptoms like chronic fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate benefit gut health?",
            "options": ["They directly kill harmful bacteria.", "They provide energy for colonocytes and promote gut barrier integrity.", "They stimulate the production of stomach acid.", "They inhibit the absorption of nutrients."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs, particularly butyrate, are a primary energy source for colonocytes, the cells lining the colon. They also help maintain gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Which of the following prebiotics has been shown to selectively promote the growth of Bifidobacteria in the gut?",
            "options": ["Inulin", "Cellulose", "Lignin", "Pectin"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Inulin is a type of fructan that has been shown to selectively promote the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria in the gut."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "According to the module content, what is the recommended initial duration for a strict elimination diet when identifying food sensitivities?",
            "options": ["1 week", "2-3 weeks", "6-8 weeks", "3-6 months"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A typical elimination diet involves removing suspected trigger foods for 2-3 weeks, followed by a systematic reintroduction to identify sensitivities."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of leaky gut syndrome (increased intestinal permeability)?",
            "options": ["Increased absorption of all nutrients.", "Reduced inflammation in the gut.", "Compromised tight junctions in the intestinal lining.", "Enhanced production of digestive enzymes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leaky gut syndrome involves increased intestinal permeability due to compromised tight junctions, allowing undigested food particles and toxins to enter the bloodstream."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A client is considering taking a probiotic supplement. What is the MOST important factor to consider when recommending a specific strain or formulation?",

            "explanation": "It's crucial to consider the specific health condition being addressed and choose probiotic strains that have been scientifically shown to be effective for that condition. While CFUs are important, strain specificity is paramount."
