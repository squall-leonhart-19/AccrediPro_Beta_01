            "question": "In the context of advanced bioenergetics, what is the theoretical net yield of ATP from the complete aerobic oxidation of one molecule of glucose, accounting for the cost of mitochondrial transport?",
            "options": ["2 ATP", "30-32 ATP", "36-38 ATP", "106-108 ATP"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern biochemical assessments account for the energy cost of transporting ATP and substrates across the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in a net yield of approximately 30-32 ATP per glucose molecule, rather than the older estimate of 36-38."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Which signaling pathway is primarily responsible for the translocation of GLUT4 storage vesicles to the plasma membrane in response to insulin?",
            "options": ["AMPK pathway", "mTORC1 pathway", "PI3K/Akt pathway", "MAPK/ERK pathway"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PI3K/Akt pathway is the primary insulin-signaling cascade that triggers the movement of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface, allowing for glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "What is the rate-limiting step in the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids within the mitochondria?",
            "options": ["The action of Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL)", "The transport of fatty acyl-CoA via Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)", "The conversion of Acetyl-CoA to Malonyl-CoA", "The hydration step of Beta-Oxidation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CPT1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid oxidation as it controls the entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria; it is notably inhibited by Malonyl-CoA."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "To maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a single meal, research suggests a 'leucine threshold' must be met. What is the typical required dose for a healthy young adult?",
            "options": ["0.5 - 1.0 grams", "2.5 - 3.0 grams", "5.0 - 7.0 grams", "10.0+ grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The leucine threshold for maximizing MPS in young adults is generally reached at approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine per bolus dose of protein."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client undergoes a metabolic cart test and shows a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70. What does this value specifically indicate regarding their fuel substrate utilization?",
            "options": ["100% Carbohydrate oxidation", "100% Fatty acid oxidation", "A 50/50 mix of carbohydrates and fats", "Anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that the body is relying almost exclusively (100%) on fatty acids for fuel, which is typical during fasting or very low-carbohydrate states."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "The process of selective autophagy that targets damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria for degradation is known as:",
            "options": ["Lipophagy", "Mitophagy", "Xenophagy", "Proteolysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mitophagy is the specialized autophagic process regulated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway that maintains cellular health by removing dysfunctional mitochondria."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "According to the 2016 Fothergill et al. study on 'The Biggest Loser' contestants, what was the average degree of metabolic adaptation (reduction in RMR below predicted levels) six years after the competition?",
            "options": ["~100 kcal/day", "~250 kcal/day", "~500 kcal/day", "~800 kcal/day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that six years later, contestants experienced a persistent metabolic adaptation of approximately 500 kcal/day (specifically ~499 kcal/day) below what would be predicted for their body composition."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which hormone, produced by adipocytes, acts on the hypothalamus to inhibit hunger and increase energy expenditure, and often becomes ineffective in states of obesity due to resistance?",
            "options": ["Ghrelin", "Glucagon", "Leptin", "Adiponectin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leptin is the 'satiety hormone' that signals energy availability to the brain. In obesity, high levels of leptin often lead to leptin resistance, where the brain fails to receive the signal to stop eating."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'The Athlete’s Paradox.' Which of the following best describes this metabolic state?",
            "options": ["High intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) storage combined with high insulin sensitivity", "Low body fat percentage with high fasting blood glucose", "High muscle mass with low mitochondrial density", "Excessive protein intake leading to negative nitrogen balance"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Athlete's Paradox refers to the observation that endurance athletes have high levels of intramyocellular lipids (similar to those with Type 2 Diabetes) but remain highly insulin sensitive due to high lipid turnover and mitochondrial capacity."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "High Glycemic Variability (GV), characterized by frequent 'spikes and crashes,' is considered more damaging to the endothelium than stable high glucose because it significantly increases the production of:",
            "options": ["Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)", "High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)", "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)", "Ketone bodies"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Fluctuating glucose levels (Glycemic Variability) trigger greater oxidative stress and ROS production than sustained hyperglycemia, leading to accelerated vascular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction."
