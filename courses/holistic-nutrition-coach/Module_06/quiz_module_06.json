            "question": "According to the 2023 NHANES data analysis cited in Lesson 1, what percentage of the US adult population is considered 'metabolically healthy' based on five key biomarkers?",
            "options": ["Approximately 6.8%", "Exactly 12.2%", "Roughly 18.5%", "Nearly 24.1%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 highlights that according to the most recent NHANES data, only 12.2% of American adults meet the criteria for optimal metabolic health across all five markers (blood glucose, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and waist circumference)."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah' (42, PCOS symptoms), which primary mechanism was identified as the driver for her elevated androgen levels despite a 'clean' diet?",
            "options": ["Primary adrenal insufficiency", "Excessive intake of cruciferous vegetables", "Hyperinsulinemia-driven stimulation of the ovarian theca cells", "A deficiency in Vitamin K2 (MK-7)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in Lesson 2, hyperinsulinemia stimulates the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, illustrating the deep link between metabolic health and hormonal balance in PCOS cases."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 details the 'Omega-3 Index.' What is the target percentage associated with a 90% reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death according to the meta-analysis provided?",
            "options": ["Greater than 4%", "Between 5% and 6%", "Greater than 8%", "Exactly 12%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Omega-3 Index (the amount of EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes) is ideally >8%. Research cited in Lesson 3 shows this level provides the highest cardioprotective benefits."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "When addressing mitochondrial dysfunction in Lesson 4, which nutrient acts as the primary electron carrier in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and showed a 25% improvement in ATP production in clinical trials?",
            "options": ["Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol)", "Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)", "Calcium Carbonate", "Folic Acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ubiquinol (CoQ10) is essential for the ETC. Lesson 4 highlights its role in mitochondrial resuscitation and the statistical improvements in cellular energy output observed in supplementation studies."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In the 'Gut-Brain Axis' deep dive (Lesson 5), what percentage of the body's total serotonin is estimated to be produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gut?",
            "options": ["10-15%", "40-50%", "70-75%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 emphasizes that 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, highlighting why digestive health is a primary pillar in holistic mental health protocols."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Based on the case study of 'Marcus' in Lesson 6, which intervention was most effective at improving his HbA1c from 6.1% to 5.4% over a 12-week period?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 7 days a week", "Time-Restricted Feeding (16:8) combined with a 30% reduction in glycemic load", "Switching from coffee to green tea", "A strict vegan diet with no caloric restriction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study of Marcus demonstrated that the synergy of TRF (16:8) and reducing the glycemic load (GL) was the most statistically significant factor in reversing his pre-diabetic markers."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Secretory IgA' (sIgA). What does a chronically low level of sIgA typically indicate in a clinical holistic setting?",
            "options": ["An overactive immune system", "Depletion of the mucosal barrier and potential chronic stress/cortisol suppression", "Optimal gut diversity", "Acute bacterial infection"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low sIgA levels suggest that the first line of immune defense in the gut is compromised, often due to chronic stress or HPA-axis exhaustion, as detailed in the 'Immune Deep Dive' section."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Goldilocks Zone' for Vitamin D3 blood levels (25-OH D) recommended in the course for optimal immune function and cancer prevention?",
            "options": ["20 - 30 ng/mL", "30 - 50 ng/mL", "60 - 80 ng/mL", "100 - 150 ng/mL"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges start at 30 ng/mL, Lesson 8 provides evidence that the 'functional' or 'optimal' range for chronic disease prevention is 60-80 ng/mL."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In the context of Phase II Liver Detoxification (Lesson 7), which pathway is specifically responsible for the conjugation of estrogen and is dependent on adequate B-vitamins and Magnesium?",
            "options": ["Sulfation", "Glucuronidation", "Methylation", "Acetylation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylation is a critical Phase II pathway for neutralizing estrogen and catecholamines. It requires B12, Folate, B6, and Magnesium as cofactors."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Micronutrient Synergy' table in Lesson 8, why is it critical to balance Zinc supplementation with Copper?",
            "options": ["Zinc increases Copper absorption to toxic levels", "High-dose Zinc induces the synthesis of metallothionein, which traps Copper and prevents its absorption", "Copper is required to activate Zinc in the bloodstream", "Zinc and Copper compete for the same receptor in the thyroid"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 explains the biochemical competition between Zinc and Copper; specifically, that Zinc induces metallothionein, which has a higher affinity for Copper, potentially leading to a Copper deficiency if not balanced (typically a 15:1 ratio)."
