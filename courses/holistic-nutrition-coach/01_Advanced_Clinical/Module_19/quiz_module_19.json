            "question": "Which of the following study designs is generally considered the 'gold standard' for establishing cause-and-effect relationships?",
            "options": ["Observational study", "Case-control study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Cross-sectional study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) minimize bias through randomization, making them the strongest design for inferring causation."

            "question": "A meta-analysis combines data from multiple studies to:",
            "options": ["Increase the sample size and statistical power", "Focus on a specific subgroup within a population", "Identify publication bias", "Determine the cost-effectiveness of an intervention"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses increase statistical power by pooling data, providing a more precise estimate of the effect size."

            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a systematic review?",
            "options": ["To provide a summary of all available research on a topic", "To conduct original research on a specific question", "To critically appraise and synthesize evidence from multiple studies using a predefined methodology", "To advocate for a specific healthcare policy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews use rigorous methods to minimize bias and provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence."

            "question": "Which of the following is a common source of bias in research studies?",
            "options": ["Random sampling", "Blinding", "Large sample size", "Selection bias"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Selection bias occurs when the participants in a study are not representative of the population being studied."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the context of research, what does 'p < 0.05' typically indicate?",
            "options": ["The results are clinically significant", "There is a less than 5% chance that the results occurred due to random chance", "The study had a small sample size", "The intervention was ineffective"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value less than 0.05 is often used as a threshold for statistical significance, suggesting the results are unlikely due to chance."

            "question": "A holistic nutrition coach reads a study funded by a sugar manufacturing company that concludes that sugar has no significant impact on weight gain. What potential bias should the coach be most aware of?",
            "options": ["Publication bias", "Recall bias", "Funding bias", "Confirmation bias"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Funding bias can occur when the results of a study are influenced by the source of funding."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is the purpose of blinding in a research study?",
            "options": ["To increase the sample size", "To reduce the cost of the study", "To minimize bias by preventing participants and/or researchers from knowing which treatment is being administered", "To simplify the data analysis process"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Blinding minimizes bias by ensuring that participants and/or researchers are unaware of the treatment being administered, reducing the potential for expectations to influence the results."

            "options": ["Google", "PubMed", "Wikipedia", "Facebook"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including research articles related to nutrition and health."

            "question": "What is the 'file drawer problem' in research?",
            "options": ["The tendency for researchers to lose data", "The bias towards publishing only statistically significant results", "The difficulty of storing large datasets", "The lack of funding for research"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'file drawer problem' refers to the tendency for studies with non-significant results to go unpublished, leading to a biased view of the evidence."

            "question": "A study reports a relative risk (RR) of 1.5 for developing heart disease in individuals who consume a high-fat diet compared to those who consume a low-fat diet. What does this mean?",
            "options": ["Individuals on a high-fat diet are 50% less likely to develop heart disease.", "Individuals on a high-fat diet are 1.5 times more likely to develop heart disease.", "Individuals on a low-fat diet are 50% more likely to develop heart disease.", "The high-fat diet has no impact on the risk of heart disease."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A relative risk of 1.5 indicates that the exposed group (high-fat diet) has a 50% higher risk (1.5 times) of developing the outcome (heart disease) compared to the unexposed group (low-fat diet)."
