            "question": "A client presents with persistent fatigue, despite adequate sleep and a balanced diet. Initial blood work is normal. Which of the following should be your *next* step in assessing potential underlying causes?",
            "options": ["Recommend a high-intensity exercise program.", "Suggest a detox cleanse.", "Explore potential food sensitivities and environmental factors.", "Prescribe a multivitamin with high doses of B vitamins."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring food sensitivities and environmental factors is a crucial next step when initial blood work is normal and fatigue persists. This aligns with a holistic approach, considering factors beyond basic nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation for a client struggling with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and reporting significant bloating and gas after meals?",
            "options": ["A strict elimination diet focusing only on meat and leafy greens.", "Probiotic supplementation and a low-FODMAP diet.", "A high-fiber diet with plenty of whole grains and legumes.", "Intermittent fasting with a 16-hour eating window."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet, combined with probiotic supplementation, is a commonly recommended and evidence-based approach for managing IBS symptoms like bloating and gas. It addresses potential triggers in the diet and supports gut health."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client with a history of anorexia nervosa is now in recovery and seeking guidance on healthy eating habits. What is the MOST important aspect to prioritize in your nutritional recommendations?",
            "options": ["Calculating their ideal body weight and setting weight loss goals.", "Focusing solely on macronutrient ratios to ensure adequate protein intake.", "Establishing a trusting relationship and addressing underlying emotional issues related to food.", "Implementing a rigid meal plan with strict calorie counting."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In recovery from anorexia nervosa, prioritizing the therapeutic relationship and addressing emotional issues is paramount. A rigid approach can be detrimental and trigger relapse."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "What is a key difference between food allergy and food intolerance?",
            "options": ["Food allergies always involve digestive symptoms, while food intolerances involve the immune system.", "Food allergies involve an immune response, while food intolerances do not.", "Food allergies are always life-threatening, while food intolerances are not.", "Food intolerances are easier to diagnose through blood tests than food allergies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food allergies involve an immune system response (IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated), while food intolerances do not. Intolerances are typically related to digestive enzyme deficiencies or reactions to food chemicals."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing frequent headaches, brain fog, and joint pain. They suspect a sensitivity to gluten. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate way to assess this potential sensitivity?",
            "options": ["Immediately start a gluten-free diet for life.", "Order a comprehensive allergy panel from a private lab.", "Recommend a strict elimination diet, followed by a gradual reintroduction of gluten-containing foods.", "Advise them to take digestive enzymes before consuming gluten."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A well-structured elimination diet with gradual reintroduction is the gold standard for identifying food sensitivities. It allows you to observe the client's reaction to gluten without relying solely on potentially inaccurate or misleading testing.",

            "options": ["A high-fiber diet to promote regular bowel movements.", "A diet high in processed foods, to avoid digestive upset.", "A low-residue diet to minimize bowel irritation.", "A ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a Crohn's disease flare-up, a low-residue diet (low in fiber, seeds, and tough skins) is often recommended to reduce bowel irritation and allow the gut to heal. High fiber intake can exacerbate symptoms during a flare."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adequate fiber intake supports the elimination of excess estrogen, and supporting liver detoxification pathways helps with the proper metabolism of estrogen. Cruciferous vegetables are actually beneficial."
