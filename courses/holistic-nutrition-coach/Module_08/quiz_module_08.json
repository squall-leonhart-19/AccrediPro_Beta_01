            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary function of the gut microbiome?",
            "options": ["Nutrient absorption", "Immune system regulation", "Neurotransmitter production", "Vitamin D synthesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While the gut microbiome does influence vitamin synthesis (like Vitamin K and some B vitamins), it is not a primary site for Vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D synthesis primarily occurs in the skin upon exposure to sunlight."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing bloating, gas, and abdominal pain after consuming wheat products. Based on this information, which of the following conditions is MOST likely to be suspected?",
            "options": ["Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)", "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)", "Celiac disease", "Gastritis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While IBS and SIBO could potentially cause these symptoms, the specific trigger of wheat products and the symptoms described are highly indicative of celiac disease, an autoimmune reaction to gluten."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the lessons, what percentage of the immune system resides in the gut?",
            "options": ["20%", "50%", "70%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70% of the immune system is located in the gut, highlighting the critical role of the gut microbiome in immune function."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary interventions is MOST likely to be recommended for a client diagnosed with SIBO?",
            "options": ["A high-fiber diet", "A ketogenic diet", "A low-FODMAP diet", "A vegan diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet is commonly recommended for SIBO as it reduces the availability of fermentable carbohydrates that fuel bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 35, reports chronic fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. Her doctor suspects leaky gut syndrome. Which of the following supplements would be MOST appropriate to initially recommend to support gut barrier integrity?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Glutamine", "Iron", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutamine is an amino acid that serves as a primary fuel source for intestinal cells and plays a vital role in maintaining gut barrier integrity. Supplementation with glutamine can help repair and strengthen the gut lining."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a healthy gut microbiome?",
            "options": ["High microbial diversity", "Presence of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli", "Low levels of inflammation", "Predominance of a single bacterial species"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A healthy gut microbiome is characterized by high microbial diversity and a balance of beneficial bacterial species. A predominance of a single species indicates an imbalance (dysbiosis)."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which prebiotics promote gut health?",
            "options": ["Directly killing pathogenic bacteria", "Providing nutrients for beneficial bacteria", "Sealing the gut lining", "Stimulating the production of digestive enzymes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers that act as food for beneficial bacteria in the gut, promoting their growth and activity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "A 2023 study found that individuals with higher levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in their gut were associated with:",
            "options": ["Increased risk of obesity", "Improved insulin sensitivity", "Higher levels of inflammation", "Decreased energy expenditure"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs, produced by the gut microbiome, have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and provide energy to colon cells."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle factors is MOST detrimental to gut health?",
            "options": ["Regular exercise", "Adequate sleep", "Chronic stress", "Consumption of fermented foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress can negatively impact the gut microbiome by altering gut motility, increasing intestinal permeability, and suppressing the immune system."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Client John, 48, is taking antibiotics for a respiratory infection. What is the MOST appropriate recommendation to support his gut health during and after antibiotic treatment?",
            "options": ["Avoid all probiotics", "Increase sugar intake to feed gut bacteria", "Consume a diet rich in processed foods", "Supplement with a high-quality probiotic containing diverse strains"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome. Supplementing with a high-quality probiotic containing diverse strains of beneficial bacteria can help restore balance and mitigate the negative effects of antibiotics."
