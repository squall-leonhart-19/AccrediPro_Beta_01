            "question": "According to the principles of Metabolic Typing discussed in Lesson 1, a 'Fast Oxidizer' typically requires which macronutrient ratio to maintain stable energy levels?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate (60%), low fat (15%), low protein (25%)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fast oxidizers convert food into energy quickly and require higher levels of protein and fat to slow down the rate of oxidation and prevent blood sugar crashes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycemic Load is calculated by multiplying the Glycemic Index by the grams of carbohydrate in a serving and dividing by 100, providing a more accurate picture of how a food affects blood sugar."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol is a key targeted nutrient for PCOS because it acts as a second messenger for insulin, helping to restore hormonal balance and metabolic function."
