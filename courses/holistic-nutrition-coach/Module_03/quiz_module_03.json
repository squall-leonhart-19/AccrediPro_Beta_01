            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, but Vitamin K2 is the cofactor required to activate proteins that deposit that calcium into the bone matrix instead of the arterial walls."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score under 1.0 is optimal; scores above 1.9 indicate early insulin resistance, and scores above 2.9 indicate significant insulin resistance."
