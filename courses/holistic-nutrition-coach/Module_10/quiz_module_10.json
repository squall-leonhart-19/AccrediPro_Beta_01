            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of 'nutrigenomics' as discussed in this module?",
            "options": ["The study of how nutrients are absorbed in the gut.", "The study of how genes influence nutrient requirements.", "The study of how nutrients affect gene expression.", "The study of the interaction between food and the microbiome."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nutrigenomics specifically focuses on how nutrients and bioactive food compounds affect gene expression. While the other options are related to nutrition, they fall under different fields of study."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of fatigue, muscle cramps, and irregular heartbeat. Based on the module's discussion of electrolyte imbalances, which mineral deficiency is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Calcium", "Magnesium", "Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium deficiency is commonly associated with fatigue, muscle cramps, and irregular heartbeat. While other deficiencies can cause fatigue, the combination of symptoms points towards magnesium."

            "question": "According to the module, what percentage of adults in the United States are estimated to be deficient in Vitamin D?",
            "options": ["5%", "15%", "42%", "75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlighted that approximately 42% of adults in the US are estimated to be deficient in Vitamin D, making it a widespread concern."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary function of the gut microbiome, as discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["Synthesizing certain vitamins", "Aiding in digestion and nutrient absorption", "Regulating blood sugar levels directly", "Modulating the immune system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the gut microbiome influences blood sugar regulation indirectly through mechanisms like short-chain fatty acid production, it does not directly regulate blood sugar levels. That is primarily the function of the pancreas and hormonal systems."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 35, is experiencing bloating and gas after meals. After reviewing her food journal, you suspect a possible food intolerance. According to the module, what is the FIRST step you should recommend to Sarah?",
            "options": ["Immediately start a restrictive elimination diet.", "Order a comprehensive food sensitivity test.", "Keep a detailed food and symptom diary for at least two weeks.", "Recommend digestive enzymes for immediate relief."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module emphasized the importance of detailed food and symptom diaries to identify potential trigger foods before implementing restrictive diets or expensive testing."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a reliable biomarker for assessing long-term blood sugar control, as discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["Fasting blood glucose", "Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)", "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)", "Random blood glucose"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) provides an average of blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months, making it a reliable indicator of long-term blood sugar control."
