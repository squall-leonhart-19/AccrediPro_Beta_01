            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "According to the principles of Metabolic Individuality (L1), why might two clients with identical caloric intakes and activity levels experience different rates of fat loss?",
            "options": [
                "Variations in the P-ratio (Partitioning Ratio) and biochemical individuality",
                "Purely due to differences in psychological motivation",
                "Differences in the thermic effect of water consumption",
                "One client is likely underreporting their food intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Biochemical individuality, as established by Roger Williams, PhD, suggests that genetic and epigenetic factors influence how nutrients are utilized. The P-ratio determines the proportion of protein to fat gained or lost during weight changes."

        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In Advanced Macronutrient Partitioning (L2), what does a high 'P-ratio' indicate during a caloric surplus?",
            "options": [
                "A higher percentage of weight gained as body fat",
                "A higher percentage of weight gained as lean muscle mass",
                "An equal distribution of fat and muscle gain",
                "A total resistance to weight gain regardless of surplus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The P-ratio (Partitioning Ratio) refers to the proportion of lean body mass to fat mass gained or lost. A higher P-ratio during a surplus means more calories are partitioned toward muscle tissue rather than adipose tissue."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When assessing the Micronutrient Matrix (L3), which factor is known to increase the bioavailability of non-heme iron by up to 300%?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming it with calcium-rich dairy",
                "Co-ingestion with 75mg of Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)",
                "Consuming it alongside high-tannin black tea",
                "Taking iron on an empty stomach with magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C acts as a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous form and preventing the formation of insoluble iron compounds."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "In the context of Endocrine-Nutrient Interactions (L4), how does chronic hypercortisolemia affect glucose metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues",
                "It suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis",
                "It promotes insulin resistance by mobilizing amino acids for glucose production",
                "It has no significant impact on blood glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic high cortisol (stress) triggers gluconeogenesis (creating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like protein) and reduces insulin sensitivity to ensure glucose remains available for the brain, leading to elevated blood sugar."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the Gut-Brain-Immune connection. Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) provides roughly 70% of the energy for colonocytes and supports the integrity of the gut barrier?",
            "options": [

                "Valerate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the primary fuel source for colonocytes (cells lining the colon). It is essential for maintaining the mucosal barrier and preventing 'leaky gut' or intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Nutrient-Drug Interactions, which common medication is most likely to cause a significant depletion of Vitamin B12 after long-term use?",
            "options": [
                "Atorvastatin (Lipitor)",
                "Metformin (Glucophage)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metformin is well-documented to interfere with the calcium-dependent absorption of the B12-intrinsic factor complex in the ileum. Studies show up to 30% of long-term users experience B12 deficiency."

            "question": "In Integrative Laboratory Analysis (L7), what is the 'Functional' range for Ferritin often used by holistic practitioners, compared to the standard clinical range?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical: 12-150 ng/mL; Functional: 40-100 ng/mL",
                "Clinical: 12-150 ng/mL; Functional: 10-20 ng/mL",

                "Functional and Clinical ranges are always identical"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While clinical ranges identify pathology (anemia), functional ranges aim for optimal vitality. A ferritin level of 15 ng/mL may be 'normal' clinically but is functionally low for optimal energy and hair growth."

            "question": "When designing a clinical protocol (L8), what is the recommended 'Order of Operations' for intervention?",
            "options": [
                "1. Supplementation, 2. Exercise, 3. Digestion, 4. Sleep",
                "1. Digestion/GI Health, 2. Blood Sugar Regulation, 3. Adrenal/Stress, 4. Targeted Support",

                "1. Macronutrients, 2. Micronutrients, 3. Laboratory testing, 4. Supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective protocol design follows a hierarchy: you must fix digestion first (to absorb nutrients) and stabilize blood sugar (to reduce systemic stress) before addressing more complex hormonal or targeted issues."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client presents with high TSH (5.2 mIU/L) but 'normal' T4. They complain of fatigue and thinning hair. Based on Lesson 4 and 7, which micronutrients are most critical for the conversion of T4 to the active T3?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium and Vitamin K2",
                "Selenium and Zinc",
                "Sodium and Potassium",
                "Vitamin E and Copper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 (inactive) to T3 (active) are selenium-dependent. Zinc is also required for the T3 receptor to function properly."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Case Study (L6): A client taking a Statin medication for high cholesterol reports new-onset muscle aches (myalgia). Which nutrient depletion should the coach investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)",

                "Vitamin A"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Statins inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which is a precursor for both cholesterol and CoQ10. Depletion of CoQ10 in the mitochondria of muscle cells is a common cause of statin-induced myopathy."
