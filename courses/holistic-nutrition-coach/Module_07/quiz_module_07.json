            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["The direct connection between the stomach and the brain.", "The bidirectional communication network linking the gut and the brain.", "The influence of dietary fiber on cognitive function.", "The impact of stress on digestive enzyme production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network involving the central and enteric nervous systems, linking emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports experiencing bloating and gas after consuming dairy products. Based on this information, which of the following digestive enzymes would be MOST beneficial to consider supplementing with?",
            "options": ["Amylase", "Lipase", "Lactase", "Protease"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lactase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose, the sugar found in dairy products. Supplementing with lactase can help alleviate bloating and gas associated with lactose intolerance."

            "question": "According to research discussed, what percentage of individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) may experience symptom improvement with a low-FODMAP diet?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-70%", "80-90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that a low-FODMAP diet can provide symptom relief for approximately 50-70% of individuals with IBS."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT considered a primary function of the gut microbiota?",
            "options": ["Synthesizing vitamins", "Aiding in digestion and nutrient absorption", "Regulating blood glucose levels", "Training the immune system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the gut microbiota plays a role in various metabolic processes, it does not directly regulate blood glucose levels. This is primarily controlled by hormones such as insulin and glucagon."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying and eliminating trigger foods is a foundational step in managing heartburn. PPIs should be considered under medical supervision, and other options would likely worsen symptoms."

            "options": ["Increasing dietary fiber intake.", "Drinking adequate water.", "Regular physical activity.", "Decreasing fat intake significantly."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While a balanced diet is important, drastically reducing fat intake is unlikely to directly alleviate constipation. Fiber, hydration, and physical activity are more established strategies."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Probiotics primarily work by influencing the existing gut microbiota, promoting a more balanced and beneficial microbial environment. They don't completely replace the existing flora."
