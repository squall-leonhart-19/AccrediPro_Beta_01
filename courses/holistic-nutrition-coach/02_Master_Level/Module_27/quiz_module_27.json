            "question": "Which of the following dietary approaches is MOST supported by research for managing symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "Ketogenic diet", "Low glycemic index (GI) diet", "High-protein, low-fiber diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low glycemic index (GI) diets have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance in women with PCOS. A 2019 meta-analysis in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition demonstrated that low-GI diets were associated with improvements in menstrual regularity and metabolic markers in PCOS patients."

            "question": "A client with diagnosed Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) reports experiencing significant bloating and gas. Which dietary intervention is typically recommended as a first-line approach?",
            "options": ["Elimination of all gluten-containing grains", "Strict adherence to a ketogenic diet", "Following a low-FODMAP diet", "Increasing intake of raw vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet, which restricts fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, is a commonly recommended first-line dietary intervention for IBS to reduce gas production and bloating. Studies have shown significant symptom reduction in up to 75% of IBS patients following a low-FODMAP diet."

            "options": ["Iron", "Vitamin D", "Selenium", "Iodine"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that iodine deficiency affects nearly 2 billion people worldwide."

            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, reports experiencing hot flashes and night sweats. She's looking for dietary recommendations to manage these symptoms. Which of the following foods may provide phytoestrogens that could potentially help alleviate her symptoms?",
            "options": ["Red meat", "Dairy products", "Soybeans", "Citrus fruits"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soybeans contain isoflavones, which are phytoestrogens that can mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Some studies suggest that soy consumption may help reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in menopausal women. A 2014 meta-analysis of 19 studies found that soy isoflavones significantly reduced hot flash frequency by 26%."

            "question": "In the context of autoimmune disease management, what is the primary rationale behind the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet?",
            "options": ["To provide a high dose of antioxidants", "To reduce inflammation and identify potential food sensitivities", "To promote rapid weight loss", "To increase the diversity of gut bacteria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AIP diet is designed to reduce inflammation and identify potential food sensitivities that may be triggering autoimmune responses. It involves eliminating foods commonly associated with inflammation, such as grains, legumes, nightshades, and dairy, and then reintroducing them one by one to assess individual tolerance."

            "question": "Which of the following is a common dietary recommendation for individuals with gout to help reduce uric acid levels?",
            "options": ["Increase consumption of organ meats", "Limit intake of purine-rich foods", "Increase consumption of refined carbohydrates", "Increase intake of high-fructose corn syrup"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limiting purine-rich foods, such as organ meats, seafood, and red meat, is a common dietary recommendation for individuals with gout. Purines are broken down into uric acid, which can crystallize in the joints and cause pain and inflammation. A 2017 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that reducing purine intake significantly lowered serum uric acid levels."

            "question": "A client with a history of kidney stones is seeking nutritional guidance. What is the MOST important dietary recommendation to help prevent the formation of calcium oxalate stones?",
            "options": ["Increase calcium intake", "Limit fluid intake", "Limit oxalate-rich foods", "Increase sodium intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Limiting oxalate-rich foods, such as spinach, rhubarb, and nuts, can help reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. While limiting calcium was previously recommended, current guidelines emphasize adequate calcium intake (around 1000-1200mg/day) from dietary sources. A 2015 Cochrane review suggests that low calcium intake may actually increase the risk of kidney stones."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary goal of nutritional interventions for individuals undergoing cancer treatment?",
            "options": ["To cure the cancer", "To prevent all side effects of treatment", "To maintain or improve nutritional status and quality of life", "To eliminate the need for medical treatment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of nutritional interventions for individuals undergoing cancer treatment is to maintain or improve nutritional status, manage side effects of treatment (e.g., nausea, fatigue, mucositis), and ultimately improve quality of life. Nutritional support can help patients tolerate treatment better and potentially improve outcomes."

            "question": "What is the key principle behind using prebiotics and probiotics for gut health?",
            "options": ["Prebiotics kill harmful bacteria, while probiotics introduce new bacteria.", "Prebiotics provide food for beneficial bacteria, while probiotics introduce live beneficial bacteria.", "Probiotics kill all bacteria, while prebiotics promote inflammation.", "Prebiotics and probiotics both kill harmful bacteria."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers that act as food for beneficial bacteria in the gut, while probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. A 2013 study in the British Journal of Nutrition demonstrated that combining prebiotics and probiotics (synbiotics) can have a synergistic effect on gut health."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eating bland, easily digestible foods, such as toast, crackers, and plain rice, can help alleviate nausea. Avoiding strong odors, eating small, frequent meals, and staying hydrated are also important strategies. Highly spiced foods and sugary beverages can exacerbate nausea. The National Cancer Institute provides guidelines on managing chemotherapy-related nausea through dietary modifications."
