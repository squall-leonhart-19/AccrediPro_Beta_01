        {
            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "Which biological mechanism is primarily responsible for the 'Hayflick Limit,' the finite number of times a cell can divide?",
            "options": [
                "The accumulation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs)",
                "The progressive shortening of telomeres during DNA replication",
                "The overactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway",
                "The depletion of mitochondrial DNA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hayflick Limit refers to the point at which a cell can no longer divide due to telomere shortening, which eventually triggers cellular senescence or apoptosis."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In the context of metabolic signaling, which pathway is considered the 'longevity switch' that promotes autophagy and cellular repair when activated by caloric restriction?",
            "options": [
                "mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin)",
                "Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMPK acts as an energy sensor; when cellular energy is low (as in fasting), it activates pathways that promote survival, energy efficiency, and autophagy, while inhibiting the growth-oriented mTOR pathway."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Based on Blue Zones research, what is the '80% rule' (Hara Hachi Bu) practiced by the long-lived population in Okinawa?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hara Hachi Bu is a Confucian teaching that instructs people to eat until they are 80% full, which naturally limits caloric intake and prevents metabolic stress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Without sufficient NAD+ levels, sirtuins cannot perform DNA repair or regulate gene expression related to longevity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Senolytics are compounds specifically researched for their ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in senescent cells, which otherwise secrete inflammatory cytokines (SASP)."
