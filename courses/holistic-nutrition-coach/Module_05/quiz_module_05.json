            "question": "A client undergoes a metabolic cart assessment and shows a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.71. What does this primarily indicate about their substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates.",
                "The client is in a state of metabolic inflexibility, unable to use fats.",
                "The client is almost exclusively utilizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The client is utilizing a 50/50 mix of glucose and lipids."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while an RQ of 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.71 suggests the client is highly efficient at utilizing lipids as their primary fuel source."

            "question": "Which of the following HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) scores is most indicative of significant insulin resistance in a clinical setting?",
            "options": [
                "0.8",
                "1.2",
                "1.9",
                "3.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While 'optimal' is often cited as <1.0 and mild resistance begins around 1.9, a score of 3.5 is a definitive clinical marker for significant insulin resistance and increased metabolic risk."

            "question": "The conversion of Thyroxine (T4) to the metabolically active Triiodothyronine (T3) is primarily dependent on which class of enzymes?",
            "options": [
                "Cytochrome P450 enzymes",
                "Selenium-dependent deiodinases",

                "Glutathione S-transferases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deiodinase enzymes (D1, D2, and D3) are responsible for removing iodine atoms from T4 to create T3 or rT3; these enzymes are selenoproteins, making selenium a critical micronutrient for thyroid conversion."

            "question": "A client presents with 'flat' diurnal cortisol patterns and a blunted Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). According to HPA axis research, what is a typical CAR increase in a healthy individual?",
            "options": [
                "A 10-15% increase within 120 minutes of waking",
                "A 50-75% increase within 30-45 minutes of waking",
                "A 200% increase by mid-afternoon",
                "There should be no increase; cortisol should be highest at 2:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In healthy individuals, cortisol levels should rise significantly (typically 50-75%) within the first 30 to 45 minutes of waking, a phenomenon known as the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin is a beneficial adipokine that enhances insulin sensitivity. Unlike most other adipokines, its levels are inversely correlated with body fat percentage."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In the context of mitochondrial health, what is the primary role of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) Complex IV (Cytochrome c oxidase)?",
            "options": [
                "It is the entry point for NADH electrons.",
                "It transfers electrons to oxygen to form water as the final step.",
                "It is the primary site of CoQ10 synthesis.",
                "It converts ADP directly into ATP without a proton gradient."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex IV is the final enzyme in the ETC, where electrons are transferred to oxygen (the final electron acceptor) to form water, facilitating the proton gradient used by ATP Synthase."

            "question": "Chrono-nutrition research suggests that Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) can improve metabolic health by aligning with the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). What is the observed effect of late-night eating on glucose tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Glucose tolerance is improved at night to handle late-night snacks.",
                "Glucose tolerance is significantly lower in the evening compared to the morning.",
                "Insulin sensitivity remains constant regardless of the time of day.",
                "Melatonin increases insulin secretion, making late-night eating optimal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human biology is naturally more insulin sensitive in the morning. Late-night eating occurs when melatonin levels rise, which can inhibit insulin secretion and lead to higher post-prandial glucose excursions."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "During Phase II Hepatic Detoxification, which pathway is specifically responsible for the detoxification of acetaminophen (Tylenol) and requires the precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC)?",
            "options": [
                "Methylation",
                "Acetylation",
                "Glutathione Conjugation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acetaminophen is metabolized via glutathione conjugation. When glutathione is depleted, a toxic intermediate (NAPQI) builds up. NAC is the rate-limiting precursor for glutathione synthesis."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female client exhibits high Reverse T3 (rT3) despite having a TSH within the 'normal' lab range. What does this clinical finding most likely suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Primary hypothyroidism requiring more T4 medication.",
                "Excessive conversion of T4 to active T3.",
                "A 'metabolic brake' often caused by chronic stress, inflammation, or extreme calorie restriction.",
                "A deficiency in iodine leading to goiter formation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High rT3 acts as a 'metabolic brake' by competing with T3 for receptor sites. It is often elevated during systemic illness, chronic stress (high cortisol), or prolonged starvation to preserve energy."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Under normal conditions, approximately 0.1% to 2.0% of the oxygen molecules consumed by the mitochondria are converted into superoxide radicals due to electron leakage, primarily at Complexes I and III."
