            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of the gut microbiome's role in overall health?",
            "options": ["Primarily involved in digestion of carbohydrates.", "Exclusively responsible for vitamin synthesis.", "A complex community of microorganisms influencing immunity, metabolism, and mental health.", "Only affects the gastrointestinal system."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that plays a critical role in various aspects of health, including immunity, metabolism, and mental well-being, not just digestion or vitamin synthesis."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with persistent bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort after consuming certain foods. Based on the module, which of the following conditions is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Iron deficiency anemia", "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)", "Vitamin D deficiency", "Essential fatty acid deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SIBO is a common cause of bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort due to the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by bacteria in the small intestine."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of the immune system is estimated to reside within the gut?",
            "options": ["20%", "50%", "70%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70% of the immune system resides in the gut, highlighting the importance of gut health for immune function."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary interventions is MOST effective for promoting a diverse and healthy gut microbiome?",
            "options": ["Following a strict ketogenic diet.", "Consuming a variety of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.", "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet.", "Focusing solely on high-protein foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A diverse diet rich in plant-based foods provides a wide range of prebiotics that nourish beneficial gut bacteria and promote microbiome diversity."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing anxiety and depression. Considering the gut-brain axis, which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate to explore?",
            "options": ["Prescribing an anti-anxiety medication.", "Recommending a high-sugar diet for improved mood.", "Assessing gut health and recommending probiotic-rich foods or supplements.", "Suggesting complete isolation to reduce stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis highlights the connection between the gut microbiome and mental health. Addressing gut health through diet and probiotics can positively influence mood and reduce anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiome benefit the host?",
            "options": ["Providing energy for brain function.", "Reducing inflammation and supporting gut barrier integrity.", "Increasing the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.", "Enhancing muscle growth and repair."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate, are produced by the fermentation of dietary fiber by gut bacteria. They play a crucial role in reducing inflammation, nourishing colonocytes, and maintaining gut barrier integrity."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 45-year-old client, experiences frequent antibiotic use due to recurrent infections. Which of the following is the MOST important recommendation to support her gut health?",
            "options": ["Continue with her regular diet, as antibiotics only affect harmful bacteria.", "Recommend a high-dose probiotic supplement and fermented foods to replenish beneficial bacteria.", "Advise her to avoid all fiber-rich foods to rest her gut.", "Suggest a complete elimination of dairy products."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis. Probiotics and fermented foods can help restore beneficial bacteria and support gut health after antibiotic use."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of a healthy gut barrier?",
            "options": ["Increased permeability to allow for better nutrient absorption.", "Tight junctions between intestinal cells to prevent leakage of toxins and pathogens.", "Absence of any immune cells in the gut lining.", "High levels of inflammation to protect against infection."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy gut barrier is characterized by tight junctions between intestinal cells, which prevent the leakage of undigested food particles, bacteria, and toxins into the bloodstream."
