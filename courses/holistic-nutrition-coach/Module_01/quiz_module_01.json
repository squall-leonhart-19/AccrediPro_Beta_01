            "question": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) protocols discussed in Lesson 2, which Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) indicates a substantially increased risk of metabolic complications in female clients?",
            "options": [
                "0.75 or lower",
                "0.80",
                "0.85 or higher",
                "0.95 or higher"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The WHO defines metabolic risk thresholds for WHR as >0.90 for men and >0.85 for women. Ratios above these figures are strongly correlated with visceral adiposity and increased cardiovascular risk."

            "id": "v_1_2",
            "question": "During a physical examination (Lesson 3), you observe 'Koilonychia' (spoon-shaped nails) in a client. This clinical sign is most frequently associated with which nutritional deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12 deficiency",
                "Iron deficiency anemia",
                "Zinc deficiency",
                "Magnesium insufficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Koilonychia, or spoon-shaped nails, is a classic clinical indicator of chronic iron deficiency. It occurs when the nail bed loses its structural integrity due to impaired iron-dependent enzyme activity."

        {
            "id": "v_1_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 5's discussion on laboratory markers, what is the 'functional' optimal range for Serum Ferritin for a female client seeking peak vitality, as opposed to the standard clinical 'normal' range (which may go as low as 15 ng/mL)?",
            "options": [
                "15–30 ng/mL",
                "70–100 ng/mL",
                "200–300 ng/mL",
                "Over 500 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While lab 'normal' ranges are broad, functional nutrition practitioners target a range of 70–100 ng/mL for ferritin to ensure adequate iron stores for thyroid function, energy production, and hair growth."

            "id": "v_1_4",
            "question": "When assessing gut health using the Bristol Stool Scale (Lesson 6), which stool types are considered 'ideal' and indicative of optimal transit time and fiber intake?",
            "options": [
                "Types 1 and 2",
                "Types 3 and 4",
                "Types 5 and 6",
                "Type 7 only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Types 3 and 4 are considered the 'gold standard' for bowel movements. Type 4 (sausage-like and smooth) indicates optimal hydration and fiber balance, whereas Types 1-2 indicate constipation and 5-7 indicate diarrhea/malabsorption."
        },
        {
            "id": "v_1_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'geographic tongue' (migratory glossitis). Based on the Vitality Assessment protocols in Lesson 3, which two nutrients should be prioritized for further investigation?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C and Vitamin E",
                "Vitamin D and Calcium",
                "B Vitamins and Zinc",
                "Sodium and Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Geographic tongue, characterized by map-like patterns on the tongue surface, is frequently associated with deficiencies in the B-vitamin complex (especially B2, B6, and B12) and Zinc."

        {
            "id": "v_1_6",
            "question": "In the context of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) assessment (Lesson 7), a consistently low HRV reading most likely indicates which state of the Autonomic Nervous System?",
            "options": [
                "High parasympathetic 'rest and digest' activity",
                "Optimal recovery and resilience",
                "Sympathetic dominance and high physiological stress",
                "Vagal tone dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low HRV indicates that the time intervals between heartbeats are overly regular, which is a sign of sympathetic nervous system dominance (fight-or-flight) and a lack of adaptive resilience to stress."

        {
            "id": "v_1_7",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2 suggested that which metric is a superior predictor of cardiometabolic risk compared to BMI (Body Mass Index)?",
            "options": [
                "Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR)",
                "Total Body Weight",
                "Calf Circumference",
                "Wrist Circumference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) is increasingly favored in functional assessments because it accounts for central adiposity relative to height, proving more accurate than BMI in predicting metabolic syndrome across different ethnicities."

        {
            "id": "v_1_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 covers environmental load. Which Phase II liver detoxification pathway is specifically responsible for neutralizing estrogen metabolites and heavy metals, requiring adequate methyl donors like folate and B12?",
            "options": [
                "Sulfation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Methylation",
                "Acetylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylation is a critical Phase II pathway that requires B-vitamins (folate, B12, B6) and betaine to process hormones (like estrogen) and heavy metals. Impaired methylation can lead to toxic accumulation."

        {
            "id": "v_1_9",
            "question": "Using the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) mentioned in Lesson 1, which factor is weighted most heavily when determining a client's nutritional status?",
            "options": [
                "The client's chronological age",
                "The client's self-reported energy levels",
                "Unintentional weight loss over the previous 6 months",
                "The number of supplements currently taken"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unintentional weight loss is a primary clinical 'red flag' in the SGA. A loss of >10% of body weight within 6 months is a significant indicator of potential malnutrition or underlying pathology."

        {
            "id": "v_1_10",
            "question": "A client scores a 14 on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Based on the scoring system discussed in Lesson 4, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Excellent sleep quality",
                "Mild sleep disturbance",
                "Severe sleep quality impairment",
                "Optimal circadian rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PSQI uses a scale of 0-21. A total score of >5 indicates 'poor' sleep quality. A score of 14 is significantly high, suggesting severe sleep dysfunction that requires immediate intervention to restore vitality."
