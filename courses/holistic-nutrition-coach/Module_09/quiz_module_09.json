            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["The direct neural connection between the stomach and the brain.", "The bi-directional communication network involving the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems linking the gut and the brain.", "The influence of dietary fiber on cognitive function.", "The brain's control over digestive enzyme secretion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis is a complex bi-directional communication network involving multiple systems, not just a direct neural connection."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing bloating, gas, and abdominal pain after consuming dairy products. Which condition is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)", "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)", "Lactose intolerance", "Celiac disease"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lactose intolerance is characterized by the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products, leading to gastrointestinal distress."

            "question": "According to research discussed, what percentage of individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) experience anxiety or depression?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that around 50% of individuals with IBS also experience symptoms of anxiety or depression, highlighting the gut-brain connection."

            "options": ["A high-fiber diet", "A ketogenic diet", "A low-FODMAP diet", "A gluten-free diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet restricts fermentable carbohydrates that can feed bacteria in the small intestine, thus alleviating SIBO symptoms."

            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, reports chronic fatigue and brain fog. A comprehensive stool test reveals low levels of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria. Which dietary strategy would be MOST appropriate to recommend FIRST?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates from her diet.", "Increasing her intake of processed foods with added probiotics.", "Incorporating prebiotic-rich foods like garlic, onions, and leeks.", "Recommending a high dose probiotic supplement immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prebiotic-rich foods feed existing beneficial bacteria, promoting their growth and potentially alleviating Sarah's symptoms. Starting with food sources is generally preferred."

            "options": ["Stress has no significant impact on the gut microbiome.", "Chronic stress can increase the diversity of the gut microbiome.", "Stress can alter the composition and function of the gut microbiome, potentially leading to dysbiosis.", "Stress only affects the gut microbiome in individuals with pre-existing gastrointestinal disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress can disrupt the balance of the gut microbiome, leading to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria and a reduction in beneficial bacteria."

            "options": ["Increased absorption of all nutrients.", "Reduced inflammation in the gut lining.", "Compromised tight junctions in the intestinal lining, allowing larger molecules to enter the bloodstream.", "Enhanced production of digestive enzymes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leaky gut syndrome involves damage to the intestinal lining, weakening the tight junctions that normally prevent large molecules from entering the bloodstream."
