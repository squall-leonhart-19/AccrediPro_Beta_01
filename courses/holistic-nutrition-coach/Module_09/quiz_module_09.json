            "question": "Which glucose transporter is primarily responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and can also be translocated via muscle contraction independent of insulin?",
            "options": ["GLUT1", "GLUT2", "GLUT3", "GLUT4"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "GLUT4 is the primary insulin-regulated glucose transporter. It is unique because it can also be translocated to the cell membrane through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways during exercise, bypassing the need for insulin."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In the context of metabolic flexibility, a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70 during a fasted state indicates which of the following?",
            "options": ["The body is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates.", "The body is primarily oxidizing fatty acids.", "The body is in a state of anaerobic glycolysis.", "The body is equally utilizing glucose and ketones."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that 100% of the fuel source being oxidized is fat. A ratio of 1.0 would indicate pure carbohydrate oxidation, while metabolic flexibility is the ability to switch efficiently between these states."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) contribute to cellular aging by binding to RAGE receptors. Which cooking method is associated with the LOWEST formation of exogenous AGEs?",
            "options": ["Poaching at 100°C (212°F)", "Broiling at 230°C (450°F)", "Deep-frying at 180°C (350°F)", "Grilling over an open flame"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "AGE formation is accelerated by high heat and low moisture. Moist heat methods like poaching, steaming, and stewing produce significantly fewer AGEs compared to dry heat methods like broiling or grilling."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Why is dietary fructose more lipogenic than glucose in the liver?",
            "options": ["It stimulates a higher insulin response than glucose.", "It is converted directly into glycogen in the liver.", "It bypasses the rate-limiting enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK).", "It can only be metabolized by skeletal muscle cells."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike glucose, fructose metabolism in the liver bypasses phosphofructokinase, the main rate-limiting step of glycolysis. This allows for an unregulated flux of substrates into de novo lipogenesis (DNL), contributing to NAFLD."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dL and a fasting insulin of 15 µIU/mL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and what does it indicate?",
            "options": ["1.2, indicating optimal insulin sensitivity.", "2.4, indicating early stage insulin resistance.", "3.6, indicating significant insulin resistance.", "5.2, indicating Type 2 Diabetes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "(98 * 15) / 405 = 3.62. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When analyzing CGM data, a client observes a sharp rise in glucose levels between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM despite not eating. This is most likely the:",
            "options": ["Somogyi Effect", "Dawn Phenomenon", "Reactive Hypoglycemia", "Post-prandial Spike"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dawn Phenomenon is a normal physiological surge in cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon in the early morning hours, which triggers the liver to release glucose. It differs from the Somogyi effect, which is a rebound from nocturnal hypoglycemia."

            "question": "According to the ATP III criteria, which of the following combinations would result in a diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome?",
            "options": ["BP 125/80, HDL 55, Glucose 90", "Waist 38\" (M), Triglycerides 160, BP 135/85", "Waist 42\" (M), Triglycerides 160, HDL 35 (M)", "Glucose 110, HDL 60, BP 115/75"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Syndrome requires 3 of 5 criteria: Waist >40\" (M) or >35\" (F); Triglycerides >150 mg/dL; HDL <40 (M) or <50 (F); BP >130/85; Fasting Glucose >100 mg/dL. Option C meets three: Waist, TG, and HDL."

            "question": "How does late-night melatonin secretion affect insulin dynamics according to chrononutrition research?",
            "options": ["It sensitizes insulin receptors in the muscle.", "It inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.", "It triggers the liver to increase glycogen storage.", "It reduces the production of cortisol."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin binds to receptors on pancreatic beta cells and inhibits insulin secretion. This is why late-night eating (when melatonin is high) results in higher and more prolonged post-prandial glucose elevations."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which lipid marker ratio is considered a strong clinical surrogate for identifying insulin resistance and atherogenic small-dense LDL particles?",
            "options": ["Total Cholesterol / HDL ratio < 2.0", "Triglyceride / HDL ratio > 3.0", "LDL / HDL ratio < 1.0", "Triglyceride / LDL ratio > 2.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride to HDL ratio (TG/HDL) greater than 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a highly reliable marker for insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles (Pattern B)."

            "question": "In a 2021 study on Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF), which primary mechanism was found to improve glycemic control even in the absence of weight loss?",
            "options": ["Increased caloric expenditure through thermogenesis.", "Reduction in total dietary fiber intake.", "Alignment of food intake with the peak of insulin sensitivity.", "Suppression of the thyroid hormone T3."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) improves glycemic control by aligning nutrient intake with the body's natural circadian rhythms, specifically the morning window when insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are highest."
