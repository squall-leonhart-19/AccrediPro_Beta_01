            "options": [
                "Pathogenesis focuses on the origins of disease, while Salutogenesis focuses on the factors that support human health and well-being.",
                "Pathogenesis utilizes only pharmaceuticals, while Salutogenesis utilizes only natural supplements.",
                "Salutogenesis is a diagnostic tool, whereas Pathogenesis is a treatment methodology.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Salutogenesis shifts the focus from 'what causes disease' to 'what creates health,' which is a foundational pillar of the blended integrative approach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "MBSR has been scientifically linked to structural changes in the brain, specifically decreasing the gray-matter density of the amygdala, which governs the 'fight or flight' stress response."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Manual therapies like osteopathy or massage support the 'blend' by improving fluid dynamics (lymphatic/blood) and shifting the patient into a 'rest and digest' (parasympathetic) state, which enhances healing."
