            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the human body's total immune system cells are located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "30-40%",
                "50-60%",
                "70-80%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently indicates that approximately 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut, making the GALT the largest immune organ in the body and the primary interface between the host and the environment."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of intestinal permeability, which protein is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions that can be measured as a clinical biomarker?",
            "options": [
                "Occludin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Claudin-1",
                "Vinculin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of tight junctions. Elevated levels are associated with the disassembly of tight junction proteins, leading to increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When interpreting advanced microbiome sequencing, 'Alpha Diversity' specifically refers to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The difference in microbial composition between two different patients.",
                "The richness and evenness of microbial species within a single sample.",
                "The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes.",
                "The presence of pathogenic parasites vs. commensal bacteria."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha diversity measures the variety (richness) and distribution (evenness) of species within a single individual's sample. Higher alpha diversity is generally correlated with better health outcomes."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with 'brain fog' and systemic inflammation. Lab results show high levels of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the serum. This condition, known as metabolic endotoxemia, primarily triggers inflammation by binding to which receptor?",
            "options": [
                "TLR2",
                "TLR4",
                "NOD2",
                "GPR43"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS is an endotoxin from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria. When it translocates into systemic circulation, it binds to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) on immune cells, triggering a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) differs from traditional SIBO in that the primary organism involved, Methanobrevibacter smithii, is a/an ________ and can reside in both the small and large intestine.",
            "options": [
                "Gram-negative bacteria",
                "Gram-positive bacteria",

                "Fungus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "M. smithii is an Archaeon, not a bacterium. Because it can overgrow in both the small and large intestines, the term IMO (Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth) is now preferred over SIBO for methane-dominant cases."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which phase of the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is known as the 'housekeeping wave' and is critical for preventing SIBO recurrence?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I",
                "Phase II",
                "Phase III",
                "Phase IV"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III of the MMC consists of powerful, rhythmic contractions that clear the small intestine of residual food and bacteria during fasting. Dysfunction in Phase III is a major risk factor for bacterial overgrowth."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "According to the Tryptophan-Kynurenine pathway model of the Gut-Brain Axis, systemic inflammation shifts tryptophan metabolism away from Serotonin and toward which neurocytotoxic metabolite?",
            "options": [
                "Quinolinic Acid",
                "Melatonin",
                "Butyrate",
                "Indole-3-propionic acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Inflammation activates the IDO enzyme, which shunts tryptophan down the kynurenine pathway. This can lead to the production of Quinolinic Acid, which is NMDA-agonistic and neurotoxic, contributing to depression and anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the treatment of fungal overgrowth (the Mycobiome), which probiotic yeast has been shown in clinical trials to inhibit Candida albicans biofilm formation and translocation?",

                "Bacillus coagulans"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast that competes with Candida for adhesion sites and secretes caprylic acid, which inhibits Candida's transition to its pathogenic hyphal form."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is the primary energy source for colonocytes and is essential for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal oxygen gradient?",
            "options": [
                "Acetate",
                "Propionate",
                "Butyrate",
                "Valerate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate provides approximately 70% of the energy needs for colonocytes. It also promotes epithelial hypoxia, which prevents the overgrowth of facultative anaerobes (pathobionts)."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client's stool test shows high levels of Beta-glucuronidase. What is the clinical significance of this finding regarding hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a deficiency in Vitamin B12 absorption.",
                "It suggests impaired Phase I liver detoxification.",
                "It indicates that conjugated estrogen is being 'unzipped' and reabsorbed into circulation.",
                "It is a direct marker for acute parasitic infection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that deconjugates hormones (like estrogen) and toxins in the gut, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted, potentially leading to estrogen dominance."
