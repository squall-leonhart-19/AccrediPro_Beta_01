            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Mastocytosis is a clonal disorder defined by an increased number of mast cells (often involving the KIT D816V mutation), while MCAS is characterized by mast cells that are normal in number but hyper-responsive to triggers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A is nephrotoxic and immunotoxic; it interferes with phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing oxidative stress that leads to DNA damage."
