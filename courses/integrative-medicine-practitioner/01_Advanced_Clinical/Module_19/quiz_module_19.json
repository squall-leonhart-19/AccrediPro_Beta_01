            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "In the Hierarchy of Evidence, why might a Systematic Review of RCTs be ranked lower than a single, high-quality multi-center RCT in specific clinical decision-making scenarios?",
            "options": [
                "Systematic reviews are inherently biased by the inclusion of non-peer-reviewed data.",
                "High heterogeneity (I² > 75%) among included studies can make pooled results clinically misleading.",
                "Meta-analyses do not use statistical significance, whereas single RCTs do.",
                "Systematic reviews are considered 'Level 5' evidence in the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) scale."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High heterogeneity (often measured by the I² statistic) suggests that the studies included in a meta-analysis are too different in population, intervention, or methodology to provide a reliable pooled estimate, making a single well-powered RCT more reliable."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A clinical trial for a new botanical extract shows a reduction in symptom incidence from 10% in the placebo group to 5% in the treatment group. What is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT)?",
            "options": [
                "5",
                "10",
                "20",
                "50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NNT is the inverse of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). ARR = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05. NNT = 1 / 0.05 = 20. This means 20 patients must be treated for one to benefit."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Which study design is considered the 'gold standard' for establishing personalized evidence-based protocols for a single patient with a chronic, stable condition?",
            "options": [
                "Retrospective Case Series",
                "N-of-1 Randomized Controlled Trial",

                "Pragmatic Clinical Trial"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N-of-1 trials are multi-period crossover trials in a single patient. They provide the highest level of evidence for that specific individual, effectively bridging the gap between population-level data and personalized medicine."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "When validating a biomarker for a rare autoimmune condition, a test with a Sensitivity of 99% and a Specificity of 70% is most useful for which clinical purpose?",
            "options": [
                "Confirming a diagnosis (Ruling-in)",
                "Screening and excluding the diagnosis (Ruling-out)",

                "Replacing the gold-standard biopsy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High sensitivity (SnNout) means a negative result is very reliable for ruling out a condition. With 99% sensitivity, if the patient tests negative, it is highly unlikely they have the disease."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In Pharmacognosy, what is the primary limitation of relying solely on 'marker compounds' for the standardization of herbal nutraceuticals?",
            "options": [
                "Marker compounds are always the primary active therapeutic agents.",
                "Marker compounds may not be the active constituents and do not account for synergistic 'entourage' effects.",
                "Marker compounds are too expensive to measure in a clinical setting.",
                "Standardization to markers is prohibited by the FDA under DSHEA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Marker compounds are often used for identification or quality control but may not be responsible for the herb's efficacy. Sole focus on one compound ignores the complex synergy of the whole plant matrix."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Whole Systems Research (WSR) in Integrative Medicine is designed specifically to address which challenge in evidence synthesis?",

                "The high cost of pharmaceutical-grade supplements.",
                "The ethical concerns of using placebos in terminal patients.",
                "The reductionist nature of RCTs that evaluate only one intervention at a time.",
                "The lack of interest from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "WSR evaluates the entire package of care (e.g., diet, acupuncture, and stress management combined) rather than isolating a single variable, reflecting how integrative medicine is practiced in the real world."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, which of the following claims is permissible for a supplement manufacturer to make without FDA pre-market approval?",
            "options": [
                "‘This product cures Type 2 Diabetes.’",
                "‘This product reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.’",

                "‘This product is a safe alternative to Ibuprofen.’"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Structure/function claims (e.g., 'supports healthy joint function') are permitted under DSHEA. Disease claims (curing, treating, or preventing a specific disease) are strictly prohibited for supplements."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A meta-analysis reports an Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.65 with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 0.42 to 1.15 for a probiotic in preventing IBS flares. How should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "The probiotic is significantly effective at reducing flares.",
                "The probiotic increases the risk of flares by 35%.",
                "The results are not statistically significant because the CI includes 1.0.",
                "The probiotic is 65% more effective than the placebo."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an Odds Ratio or Relative Risk, if the 95% Confidence Interval crosses 1.0, the result is not statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level, as 1.0 represents 'no difference' between groups."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "When interpreting a Forest Plot in a meta-analysis, what does the horizontal line passing through a study's square represent?",
            "options": [
                "The weight assigned to that study in the meta-analysis.",
                "The confidence interval for that specific study's effect size.",

                "The publication bias of the study."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The horizontal line represents the confidence interval (usually 95%) for that individual study. The square represents the point estimate (effect size)."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Practice-Based Evidence' (PBE) in the context of an Integrative Medicine clinic?",
            "options": [
                "Evidence derived from animal models before human trials.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PBE involves using 'real-world' data collected from actual clinical settings to determine what works for specific patient populations, complementing the 'top-down' approach of traditional RCTs."
