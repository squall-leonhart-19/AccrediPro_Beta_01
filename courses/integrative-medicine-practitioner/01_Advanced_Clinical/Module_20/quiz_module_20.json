            "question": "In Advanced Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis, what is the 'optimal' functional range for Fasting Serum Glucose, as opposed to the standard laboratory reference range?",
            "options": [
                "65 - 99 mg/dL",
                "75 - 86 mg/dL",
                "85 - 110 mg/dL",
                "90 - 105 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs often use a ceiling of 99 mg/dL, functional medicine identifies the optimal range as 75-86 mg/dL. Research indicates that fasting glucose levels above 86 mg/dL are associated with a progressive increase in cardiovascular risk and metabolic dysfunction."

            "question": "An Organic Acids Test (OAT) reveals significantly elevated levels of Arabinose. Which clinical condition is this marker most specifically associated with?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondrial complex I deficiency",
                "Clostridia bacterial overgrowth",
                "Candida albicans overgrowth",
                "Dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arabinose is a five-carbon sugar produced by the overgrowth of Candida species. Elevated levels on an OAT are a primary indicator of fungal dysbiosis, often correlating with symptoms of brain fog and sugar cravings."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When interpreting a GI-MAP or similar microbiome mapping tool, a low level of Secretory IgA (sIgA) combined with high Zonulin suggests which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Robust mucosal immunity with acute infection",
                "Depleted mucosal immunity and increased intestinal permeability",
                "High microbial diversity and healthy barrier function",
                "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) with high bile acid production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA is the first line of defense in the gut mucosa; low levels indicate a 'tired' immune system. High Zonulin is the gold-standard biomarker for the breakdown of tight junctions, indicating intestinal permeability (leaky gut)."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Slow COMT' (Val158Met AA) genotype. Which clinical recommendation is most appropriate regarding their catecholamine and estrogen metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caffeine intake to stimulate neurotransmitter turnover",
                "Avoid magnesium as it over-activates the COMT enzyme",
                "Support methylation and minimize stressors that increase adrenaline",
                "Prioritize high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in the late evening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Slow COMT' variant results in a 3-4x reduction in enzyme activity, leading to slower clearance of dopamine, epinephrine, and estrogens. Supporting the methyl donor pool and managing stress is critical to prevent neurotransmitter 'flooding' and estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Mycotoxin Assessment, which toxin is specifically known for its nephrotoxicity and its ability to inhibit protein synthesis by competing with phenylalanine?",
            "options": [
                "Aflatoxin B1",
                "Ochratoxin A (OTA)",
                "Gliotoxin",
                "Mycophenolic Acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a potent mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium. It is primarily nephrotoxic (kidney damaging) and interferes with phenylalanine metabolism, often requiring targeted glutathione support for clearance."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In a DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) report, a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) with high nighttime cortisol typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Acute stress response and high HPA-axis resilience",
                "HPA-axis dysfunction (Circadian Misalignment)",
                "Addison's Disease",
                "Optimal adrenal function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR should show a 50-160% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A flat CAR combined with high night cortisol suggests the HPA axis is 'inverted' or misaligned, often seen in shift workers or those with chronic burnout."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Which cardiometabolic biomarker is considered a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C because it measures the total number of atherogenic particles?",
            "options": [
                "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)",
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Triglyceride/HDL Ratio",
                "High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Every atherogenic particle (VLDL, IDL, LDL) carries exactly one molecule of ApoB. Therefore, ApoB provides a direct count of the total number of particles that can drive plaque formation, making it superior to LDL-C (which only measures the mass of cholesterol within particles)."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the context of wearable data, a significant and sustained drop in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - specifically the rMSSD metric - most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Increased parasympathetic tone and recovery",
                "Dominance of the sympathetic nervous system and physiological strain",
                "Improved cardiovascular fitness",
                "A decrease in systemic inflammation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV (specifically rMSSD) measures the beat-to-beat variation mediated by the vagus nerve. A drop in HRV signifies that the sympathetic nervous system is dominating, indicating the body is under stress, overtrained, or fighting an incipient infection."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "When assessing the 2-OH / 16-OH estrogen metabolite ratio on a DUTCH test, which finding is associated with a lower risk of estrogen-sensitive cancers?",
            "options": [
                "A higher preference for the 16-OH pathway",
                "A higher preference for the 4-OH pathway",
                "A higher preference for the 2-OH pathway",
                "Low levels of 2-methoxyestrone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2-OH pathway is considered 'protective,' while the 16-OH and 4-OH pathways are more proliferative and potentially DNA-damaging. A higher 2-OH:16-OH ratio is generally targeted in functional oncology and hormone balancing."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "An Integrative Practitioner sees a client with chronic fatigue. The OAT shows high Succinic Acid (Succinate) and high Fumaric Acid. Which mitochondrial process is likely impaired?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-oxidation of fatty acids",
                "The Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle",
                "Glycolysis",
                "Urea Cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Succinate and Fumarate are intermediates in the Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle. Elevations in these organic acids suggest a 'bottleneck' in mitochondrial energy production, often due to nutrient deficiencies (like CoQ10 or Riboflavin) or oxidative stress."
