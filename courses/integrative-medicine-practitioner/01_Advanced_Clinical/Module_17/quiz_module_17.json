            "question": "In the BRIDGE Framework for multi-systemic illness, what does the 'B' (Barrier Restoration) phase prioritize before addressing deep microbial protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive heavy metal chelation",
                "Stabilizing the gut-vascular barrier and blood-brain barrier",

                "Elimination of all dietary carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BRIDGE framework emphasizes stabilizing barrier function (gut, lung, and blood-brain barrier) first to prevent systemic 'leakage' of toxins and inflammatory mediators during later detoxification phases."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to the consensus criteria for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a diagnostic rise in serum tryptase is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "Any level above 11.4 ng/mL at any time",
                "A 50% increase from the patient's baseline during a flare",
                "A rise of (20% + 2 ng/mL) above the patient's baseline within 1-2 hours of a flare",
                "A consistent level above 20 ng/mL over a 24-hour period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The international consensus formula for a significant mast cell activation event is a rise of at least 20% plus 2 ng/mL above the individual's baseline tryptase level."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), approximately what percentage of the population carries the HLA-DR genetic susceptibility that prevents the effective clearance of biotoxins?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker indicates that roughly 25% of the population carries HLA-DR/DQ genetic haplotypes that make them unable to recognize and clear biotoxins from mold, Lyme, or dinoflagellates."

            "id": "q17_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Microglial priming occurs when an initial 'hit' (like systemic infection) shifts microglia into a pro-inflammatory state, leading to an exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory response upon a second 'hit'."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "The 'Mosaic of Autoimmunity' suggests that patients with one diagnosed autoimmune condition have a significantly higher risk of developing others. What is the approximate prevalence of poly-autoimmunity in these patients?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that approximately 25-30% of patients with one autoimmune disease will eventually meet the criteria for at least one additional autoimmune diagnosis."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "To meet the diagnostic criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) in an adult, the heart rate must increase by at least how many beats per minute (bpm) within 10 minutes of standing?",
            "options": [
                "15 bpm",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The standard diagnostic criterion for POTS in adults is a heart rate increase of 30 bpm or more (or a heart rate exceeding 120 bpm) within 10 minutes of standing, in the absence of orthostatic hypotension."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Lactate-to-Pyruvate ratio greater than 20:1 is a recognized indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the cell is relying on anaerobic glycolysis due to a failure in the electron transport chain."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "The 'Pentad Super-Syndrome' frequently seen in complex cases includes MCAS, POTS, and which other condition related to connective tissue laxity?",

                "Ankylosing Spondylitis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Triad' or 'Pentad' of chronic illness often involves the intersection of MCAS, POTS, and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS), as connective tissue laxity can contribute to both autonomic dysfunction and mast cell degranulation."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "When using the Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) test to screen for CIRS, a 'fail' is typically characterized by a deficit in which columns of the test?",
            "options": [
                "Column A only",
                "Columns C and D (Middle and Lower Frequencies)",

                "All columns equally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biotoxins specifically affect the neurological processing of contrast; a deficit in the middle and lower frequencies (Columns C and D) is the hallmark signature of biotoxin-related neurological impairment."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "During the 'E' (Exogenous Trigger Removal) phase of the BRIDGE method, why is it critical to assess the home environment for Mycotoxins before starting aggressive binders?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the patient can afford the supplements",
                "Because binders are ineffective against Mycotoxins",
                "To prevent 're-toxing' where the patient continues to inhale toxins while trying to clear them",
                "Because Mycotoxins are only found in food, not the environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the BRIDGE method, environmental remediation must precede or occur alongside internal detoxification; otherwise, the patient remains in a state of constant 're-exposure,' which prevents the resolution of the systemic inflammatory response."
