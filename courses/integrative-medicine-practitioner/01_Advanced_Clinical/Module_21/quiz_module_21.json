            "options": [
                "Rapid Response: Immediate symptom suppression",
                "Root Cause Resolution: Identifying the primary driver of dysfunction",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The B.R.I.D.G.E. Method™ stands for Biopsychosocial Assessment, Root Cause Resolution, Integrative Synthesis, Data-Driven Design, Goal Alignment, and Evolving Evaluation."

            "question": "In the Clinical Triage hierarchy (Lesson 2), which system should generally be addressed FIRST when a patient presents with multi-system dysfunction involving hormones, digestion, and mood?",
            "options": [
                "Downstream sex hormone replacement",
                "Gastrointestinal integrity and HPA axis stabilization",
                "Neurotransmitter modulation for mood support",
                "Heavy metal detoxification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical triage dictates that 'upstream' systems—specifically the GI tract (absorption/barrier function) and the HPA axis (stress response)—must be stabilized before addressing downstream hormones or intensive detox."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When sequencing conventional and complementary interventions (Strategic Blending), what is the primary risk of introducing St. John's Wort alongside a conventional SSRI?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that objective biomarkers like hs-CRP provide 'visual proof' of progress, which a meta-analysis showed increases patient adherence and compliance by approximately 38%."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Slow COMT' (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) polymorphism. How does this nutrigenomic data influence their treatment plan for stress management?",
            "options": [
                "They require higher doses of caffeine to stimulate dopamine",
                "They may experience prolonged stress responses as they clear catecholamines more slowly",
                "They should avoid all methyl-donor supplements like Methyl-B12",
                "They have a higher risk of Vitamin D deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow COMT genotypes result in slower degradation of dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, meaning these clients often experience longer-lasting physiological stress responses and may be sensitive to methyl-donors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization Phase (Phase 1) focuses on safety, reducing acute symptoms, and stopping the 'fire' of inflammation to allow the body to respond to deeper interventions later."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "If a patient experiences a 'Plateau' at Week 8 of a metabolic protocol, which troubleshooting step is recommended in Lesson 7 before changing the entire intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Double the dosage of all current supplements",
                "Switch to a different brand of the same nutrients",

                "Immediately refer to an emergency department"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 teaches that plateaus often occur when 'hidden' variables—such as poor sleep hygiene or unaddressed stealth infections—block the efficacy of an otherwise sound protocol."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The 'Assessment' section is where the practitioner summarizes their findings for the other members of the care team."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune cases, sequencing requires addressing the trigger. Since gluten molecular mimicry is a common driver of Hashimoto's and gut permeability fuels systemic inflammation, gut-healing is the logical priority."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Metabolic Bio-individuality' (Lesson 5), why might two patients with identical HbA1c levels require different carbohydrate tolerances?",
            "options": [
                "Differences in insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 translocation efficiency",
                "It is a trick question; all patients with the same HbA1c should eat the same diet",
                "Differences in their blood type (A vs. O)",
                "Only their age determines carbohydrate tolerance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bio-individuality means that the physiological response to glucose is mediated by insulin sensitivity, muscle mass, and GLUT4 receptor efficiency, requiring personalized macro ratios even for similar biomarker results."
