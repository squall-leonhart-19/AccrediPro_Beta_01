            "question": "In Precision Nutrigenomics, a client presents with a homozygous COMT Val158Met (Met/Met) polymorphism. Which clinical consideration is most appropriate when designing their epigenetic modulation protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive high-dose methyl donor supplementation to bypass the slow enzyme.",
                "Cautious introduction of methyl donors, as slower catecholamine clearance may lead to anxiety or irritability.",
                "High-dose caffeine intake to stimulate dopamine production.",
                "Avoidance of all magnesium, as it inhibits the remaining enzyme function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT Met/Met variant results in a 3-4 fold reduction in enzyme activity. Because COMT is responsible for breaking down catecholamines and estrogens, adding excessive methyl donors too quickly can lead to a 'methyl trap' or an accumulation of neurotransmitters, causing side effects like anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound) promotes angiogenesis and tissue repair primarily by upregulating the expression of VEGF receptor 2, facilitating the formation of new blood vessels and granulation tissue."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A practitioner observes a high NADH:NAD+ ratio in a client's metabolic profile. This 'reductive stress' state most likely indicates which mitochondrial condition?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high NADH:NAD+ ratio suggests that NADH is not being efficiently oxidized back to NAD+ by the mitochondria, often due to dysfunction at Complex I of the ETC, leading to decreased ATP production and increased ROS generation."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Biofeedback, which frequency domain of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is most closely associated with parasympathetic (vagal) activity and respiratory sinus arrhythmia?",

                "Ultra Low Frequency (ULF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The High Frequency (HF) band (0.15–0.40 Hz) in HRV power spectral analysis is widely recognized as a marker of parasympathetic nervous system activity and is strongly influenced by the breathing cycle."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Phase III detoxification involves the efflux of conjugated toxins out of the cell. Which family of transporters is primarily responsible for this ATP-dependent process?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase III detoxification relies on transport proteins, specifically the ABC transporter family (including P-glycoprotein/MDR1), to pump neutralized toxins across cell membranes into the bile, urine, or intestinal lumen for excretion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mitohormesis is a biological response where low levels of mitochondrial stress (ROS) trigger adaptive signaling pathways, such as Nrf2, which upregulate the body's own antioxidant defenses (Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase) and repair mechanisms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "At high pharmacological concentrations achieved only via IV, Vitamin C reacts with metal ions in the interstitial fluid to generate hydrogen peroxide, which selectively exerts oxidative stress on cancer cells that often lack catalase."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senescent cells (zombie cells) stop dividing but remain metabolically active, secreting the SASP—a cocktail of pro-inflammatory signals that contribute to systemic 'inflammaging' and the dysfunction of adjacent healthy cells."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The RER scale ranges from 0.7 (pure fat oxidation) to 1.0 (pure carbohydrate oxidation). An RER of 0.85 represents a balanced utilization of both substrates."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The GSTM1 null genotype means the individual lacks the Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 enzyme entirely, significantly reducing their ability to detoxify environmental carcinogens and heavy metals through glutathione conjugation."
