            "question": "In the context of Integrative Oncology (L1), what is the primary rationale for using high-dose Melatonin (20mg+) as an adjunctive metabolic strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To induce sedation and improve sleep architecture only",
                "To inhibit the Warburg Effect by shifting cancer cells toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation",
                "To increase glucose uptake in the tumor microenvironment through GLUT-1 stimulation",
                "To decrease the production of reactive oxygen species in malignant cells exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-dose melatonin has been shown to inhibit the Warburg Effect by suppressing HIF-1α, thereby reducing aerobic glycolysis and forcing cancer cells toward oxidative phosphorylation, which increases their sensitivity to apoptosis."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Advanced Autoimmunity (L2), which T-cell subset is primarily responsible for the tissue destruction seen in neuro-immunological conditions like Multiple Sclerosis?",
            "options": [
                "Th2 cells producing IL-4 and IL-5",
                "T-regulatory (Treg) cells producing TGF-beta",
                "Th17 cells producing IL-17 and IL-22",
                "Th3 cells involved in mucosal tolerance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Th17 cells are the primary drivers of neuro-inflammation and tissue destruction in most autoimmune conditions. They produce IL-17, which disrupts the blood-brain barrier and recruits neutrophils to the CNS."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In Pediatric Integrative Medicine (L3), a landmark 2014 study by Singh et al. found that which compound significantly improved behavioral symptoms in young males with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?",
            "options": [
                "Synthetic Vitamin C",
                "Sulforaphane (from broccoli sprout extract)",
                "High-dose Fluoride",
                "Isolated Casein protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane was found to improve social interaction and verbal communication in ASD patients by upregulating the heat shock response and Nrf2 signaling, protecting against oxidative stress."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In Geriatric Optimization (L4), what is the 'Anabolic Threshold' of Leucine required per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in elderly patients with sarcopenia?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.5 - 2.0 grams",

                "5.0 - 7.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, elderly individuals require a higher 'Leucine trigger' (approximately 2.5g to 3g per meal) compared to younger individuals to effectively stimulate mTOR and muscle protein synthesis."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In Integrative Cardiology (L5), why is Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] considered a critical marker beyond standard LDL-C measurements?",
            "options": [
                "It is purely dietary and can be lowered by reducing saturated fat",
                "It is a genetically determined particle that is both pro-atherogenic and pro-thrombotic",
                "It represents the total amount of HDL in the bloodstream",
                "It only becomes elevated in patients with Type 1 Diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with an added apolipoprotein(a) tail. It is highly resistant to diet and lifestyle changes and contributes to cardiovascular risk through both cholesterol deposition and interference with fibrinolysis."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In Women’s Health (L6), which estrogen metabolite is considered 'protective' due to its weak estrogenic activity and lower risk of DNA damage?",
            "options": [
                "16α-Hydroxyestrone (16-OH)",
                "4-Hydroxyestrone (4-OH)",

                "Estrone Sulfate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "2-Hydroxyestrone (2-OH) is considered the 'good' estrogen metabolite. In contrast, 16-OH is highly proliferative, and 4-OH can form quinones that cause direct DNA damage."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "The Tryptophan-Kynurenine pathway (L7) explains how systemic inflammation leads to depression. Which enzyme is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IFN-gamma) to divert tryptophan away from serotonin production?",
            "options": [
                "Tyrosine Hydroxylase",
                "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)",
                "MAO-A",
                "5-HTP Decarboxylase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The IDO enzyme is induced by inflammation. It diverts tryptophan into the kynurenine pathway, leading to the production of neurotoxic quinolinic acid instead of mood-stabilizing serotonin."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Environmental Medicine (L8), a 'Null' genotype for GSTM1 (Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 1) results in which of the following clinical implications?",
            "options": [
                "Enhanced ability to detoxify heavy metals",
                "Reduced capacity to conjugate xenobiotics with glutathione, increasing oxidative stress",
                "Faster clearance of caffeine and pharmaceutical drugs",
                "Total immunity to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A GSTM1 null genotype means the individual lacks the enzyme entirely, significantly reducing their ability to detoxify environmental toxins like PAHs and increasing their susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 68-year-old male with early-stage cognitive decline (L4) is prescribed a 'Senolytic' protocol. What is the standard administration strategy for senolytic agents like Quercetin and Dasatinib?",
            "options": [
                "Daily low-dose administration for 12 months",
                "Intermittent 'Hit and Run' dosing (e.g., 2 consecutive days every month)",
                "Intravenous administration every 4 hours",
                "Only when symptoms of acute infection are present"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senolytics are typically used in a 'hit and run' fashion. Because it takes weeks for senescent cells to accumulate, intermittent dosing is sufficient to clear them without the toxicity of daily administration."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A 2018 meta-analysis (n=546) discussed in Lesson 5 found that Coenzyme Q10 supplementation had what effect on patients taking statins?",
            "options": [
                "It increased the LDL-lowering effect of the statin by 50%",
                "It significantly reduced Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms (SAMS)",
                "It caused a dangerous interaction that led to liver failure",
                "It had no effect compared to placebo on muscle pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis (Qu et al., 2018) showed that CoQ10 supplementation significantly reduced statin-associated muscle symptoms, including pain, tenderness, and weakness, by replenishing mitochondrial CoQ10 depleted by the drug."
