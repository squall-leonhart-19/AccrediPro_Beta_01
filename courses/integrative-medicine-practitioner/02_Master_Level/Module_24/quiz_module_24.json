        {
            "id": "q24_1",
            "question": "In the context of Systems Biology (Lesson 1), which concept describes a phenomenon where the collective behavior of a biological system displays properties that its individual components do not possess?",
            "options": ["Linear Reductionism", "Emergence", "Homeostatic Equilibrium", "Deterministic Pathophysiology"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emergence is a core principle of systems biology, where complex systems exhibit properties (like consciousness or metabolic flux) that cannot be predicted solely by studying individual parts in isolation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of the Masterful Therapeutic Alliance (Lesson 2), what is the 'Righting Reflex' and why should a Master Practitioner avoid it?",
            "options": ["The urge to correct a client's posture; it distracts from the psychological work.", "The biological drive to maintain pH balance; it is irrelevant to behavioral change.", "The practitioner's urge to fix a client's problems; it often triggers resistance and reduces autonomy.", "The client's tendency to agree with the practitioner; it creates a false sense of progress."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the natural impulse to provide solutions. In advanced behavioral psychology, this is avoided because it often causes the client to argue the opposite side, hindering the internal motivation necessary for long-term change."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When performing Multi-Omic Functional Data Integration (Lesson 3), which data layer provides the most accurate 'real-time' snapshot of a client's current physiological state?",
            "options": ["Genomics (DNA sequence)", "Epigenomics (DNA methylation)", "Metabolomics (Small molecule metabolites)", "Transcriptomics (RNA expression)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While genomics tells you what might happen, metabolomics reflects what is currently happening in the body's biochemistry, making it the most dynamic 'real-time' layer of omic data."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A client is taking a statin medication and begins a high-dose Berberine protocol. Based on Pharmacology & Nutraceutical Synergy (Lesson 4), what is the primary concern?",
            "options": ["Berberine induces CYP3A4, potentially reducing the efficacy of the statin.", "Berberine inhibits CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, potentially increasing statin serum levels and myopathy risk.", "Berberine and statins have an antagonistic effect on the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme.", "There is no known interaction; both work synergistically on LDL receptors without metabolic interference."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine is a known inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein. Since many statins (like Atorvastatin) are metabolized by CYP3A4, this synergy can lead to dangerously high levels of the medication."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In Clinical Genomics (Lesson 5), a client with a COMT Val158Met 'Met/Met' (AA) genotype is likely to exhibit which clinical characteristic regarding catecholamine clearance?",
            "options": ["Rapid clearance of dopamine, leading to ADHD-like symptoms.", "Slow clearance of dopamine, leading to higher executive function but increased anxiety under stress.", "Inability to methylate B12, leading to megaloblastic anemia.", "High sensitivity to caffeine due to impaired CYP1A2 expression."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Met/Met polymorphism results in a 3-4 fold reduction in COMT enzyme activity. This leads to higher baseline dopamine levels, which can enhance cognition but makes the individual more prone to 'overloading' and anxiety during stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Which diagnostic finding is part of the 'consensus criteria' for diagnosing Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) as discussed in Lesson 6?",
            "options": ["A baseline tryptase level exceeding 20 ng/mL.", "A rise in serum tryptase of at least (20% + 2 ng/mL) above baseline during a symptomatic flare.", "The presence of the HLA-DRB1 gene mutation.", "A positive Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS) test."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The international consensus criteria for MCAS require a transient increase in serum tryptase levels of at least 20% plus 2 ng/mL above the individual's baseline within 1-4 hours of a flare."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In Longevity Science (Lesson 7), the 'Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype' (SASP) refers to:",
            "options": ["The rate at which telomeres shorten during cellular division.", "The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases by aging cells that damages neighboring tissue.", "The specific methylation pattern used to calculate the Horvath Clock.", "The process by which mitochondria switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SASP is the phenomenon where senescent ('zombie') cells secrete inflammatory factors that drive systemic 'inflammaging' and promote dysfunction in nearby healthy cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner identifies a complex interaction between a client's Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) and their underlying POTS. According to Lesson 6, what is the first priority in the Shoemaker Protocol for CIRS?",
            "options": ["VIP Nasal Spray to restore pituitary function.", "Removal from the mold-damaged environment and use of binders (CSM/Welchol).", "High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).", "Eradication of MARCoNS using EDTA nasal spray."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first and most critical step in the Shoemaker Protocol for CIRS is 'Removal from Exposure' followed by the use of anion-exchange resin binders to remove circulating biotoxins."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "Regarding the Horvath Epigenetic Clock (Lesson 7), a 'negative' Age Acceleration value (e.g., -5.0) indicates:",
            "options": ["The individual is aging 5% faster than the general population.", "The individual's biological age is 5 years younger than their chronological age.", "The individual has 5 years of life expectancy remaining.", "The individual's DNA methylation is 5% lower than the baseline."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In epigenetic aging metrics, a negative age acceleration value means the biological age (determined by DNA methylation patterns) is lower than the chronological age, suggesting slower biological aging."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Under the ethical framework of 'Professional Excellence' (Lesson 8), what is the primary requirement when a practitioner uses an 'off-label' nutraceutical intervention for a complex condition?",
            "options": ["Obtaining a signed waiver that the practitioner is not responsible for outcomes.", "Ensuring the intervention is cheaper than the pharmaceutical alternative.", "Providing a clear evidence-based rationale, discussing risks/benefits, and obtaining informed consent.", "Waiting for FDA approval before recommending the supplement."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners must operate with transparency. Using 'off-label' or innovative interventions requires a high standard of informed consent, where the evidence, logic, and potential risks are clearly communicated to the client."
