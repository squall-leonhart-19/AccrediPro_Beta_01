            "question": "According to the principle of 'Biochemical Individuality' popularized by Roger Williams, PhD, why might two individuals have vastly different responses to the same dosage of Vitamin C?",
            "options": [
                "Because of differences in placebo sensitivity only",
                "Due to genetically determined variations in enzyme sequences and organ size/function",
                "Because Vitamin C is only effective for 15% of the population",
                "Strictly due to differences in body mass index (BMI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Williams' research demonstrated that inter-individual variation in anatomy and enzyme activity can vary by 10-fold or more, meaning 'average' nutritional requirements are often clinically irrelevant for the individual."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client presents with the MTHFR 677C>T homozygous polymorphism. Based on the module's discussion of epigenetics, what is the most significant clinical implication for their protocol?",
            "options": [
                "They should avoid all forms of Vitamin B12 to prevent toxicity",
                "They have a 100% chance of developing cardiovascular disease regardless of diet",
                "They likely have a ~70% reduced capacity to convert folic acid into its active methylfolate form",
                "They require high-dose synthetic folic acid to bypass the genetic block"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR 677C>T homozygous variant significantly reduces the enzyme's efficiency in methylating folate, necessitating the use of 5-MTHF rather than synthetic folic acid."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional and integrative models, Antecedents are pre-existing factors (genetic, congenital, or developmental) that set the stage for later dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "APOE ε4 carriers are more sensitive to saturated fats, which can increase LDL and inflammation, while DHA has been shown to be particularly neuroprotective in this specific genetic subset."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The exposome encompasses all environmental exposures (diet, lifestyle, chemicals, stress) from conception onwards, complementing the genome in determining health outcomes."
