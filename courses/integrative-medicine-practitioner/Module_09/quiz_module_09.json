            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SASP refers to the phenomenon where senescent cells remain metabolically active and secrete a cocktail of pro-inflammatory factors (like IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) that damage neighboring tissues and drive chronic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fasano's Triad posits that autoimmunity requires a genetic susceptibility, exposure to an environmental antigen (trigger), and a breach in the intestinal barrier (permeability/leaky gut)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system mounts a response against a foreign substance (toxin or pathogen) that shares structural similarities with self-tissues, leading to an autoimmune attack."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In Post-Viral Syndromes (PVS), the 'Viral Reservoir' hypothesis suggests that symptoms persist because:",
            "options": [
                "The virus has been completely cleared, but the patient has 'illness memory'",
                "Persistent viral fragments or proteins remain in tissues (like the gut or CNS) and continue to stimulate the immune system",
                "The patient is continuously being re-infected by the same virus every 30 days",
                "The virus has mutated into a non-pathogenic bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The viral reservoir hypothesis suggests that even if a virus is not actively replicating in the blood, remnants or 'ghosts' of the virus persist in deep tissues, driving chronic immunometabolic dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In glucocorticoid resistance, the receptors on immune cells become 'deaf' to the inhibitory signals of cortisol, meaning the body can no longer effectively downregulate the inflammatory response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thymic involution is a primary driver of immunosenescence; by age 50, roughly 80% of the thymus is replaced by adipose tissue, severely limiting the output of new naive T-cells."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the wall of the digestive tract; elevated levels are a validated marker for 'leaky gut' and increased intestinal permeability."
