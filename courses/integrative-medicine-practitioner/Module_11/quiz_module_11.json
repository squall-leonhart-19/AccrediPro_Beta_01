            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In the Neuro-Endo-Immune (NEI) supersystem, which cytokine is primarily responsible for crossing the blood-brain barrier to initiate 'sickness behavior' and activate the HPA axis during systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IL-6 acts as a major systemic messenger that communicates peripheral immune activation to the CNS, triggering the HPA axis and the production of CRH, which eventually leads to cortisol release to dampen the immune response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GALT contains roughly 70-80% of the body's immune cells, making the gut the primary interface for immune education and the maintenance of systemic tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Fasano's model posits that autoimmunity requires a genetic susceptibility, exposure to an environmental trigger, and a breach in the intestinal barrier (leaky gut) that allows the trigger to interact with the immune system."
