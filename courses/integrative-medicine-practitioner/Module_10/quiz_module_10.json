            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the context of the Neuro-Immune-Gastrointestinal (NIG) axis, what percentage of the Vagus nerve fibers are afferent (sensory), carrying information from the gut to the brain?",
            "options": ["Approximately 20%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 80-90%", "Exactly 100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve is predominantly afferent (80-90%), meaning the majority of communication in the NIG axis involves the gut 'reporting' its immune and microbial status to the Central Nervous System."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "When interpreting Advanced Metagenomic Sequencing (Shotgun Sequencing) compared to 16S rRNA sequencing, what is the primary clinical advantage?",
            "options": ["It is significantly cheaper and faster to process", "It identifies only bacteria, whereas 16S identifies viruses and fungi", "It provides functional gene profiling, showing what the microbes are capable of doing, not just who they are", "It only sequences the hypervariable regions of the ribosome"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metagenomic Shotgun Sequencing looks at all the DNA in a sample, allowing for functional profiling (e.g., metabolic pathways, antibiotic resistance genes) and species/strain-level resolution, unlike 16S which is limited to genus-level identification of bacteria."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A patient presents with dermatographism, post-prandial flushing, and brain fog. You suspect Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). According to consensus criteria, a 'positive' serum tryptase test requires the peak level to be:",
            "options": ["At least 20% + 2 ng/mL above the patient's baseline tryptase", "Any value above 11.4 ng/mL", "A decrease of 20% during an acute flare", "Stable regardless of symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The consensus diagnostic criterion for MCAS requires a rise in serum tryptase of at least 20% + 2 ng/mL above the patient's own baseline, measured within 1-2 hours of a symptomatic flare."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Which mycotoxin, frequently found in water-damaged buildings and contaminated grain, is specifically noted for its potent nephrotoxicity and its ability to inhibit protein synthesis by competing with phenylalanine?",
            "options": ["Aflatoxin B1", "Ochratoxin A (OTA)", "Gliotoxin", "Satratoxin G"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is highly nephrotoxic and interferes with phenylalanine metabolism, leading to inhibited protein synthesis and significant oxidative stress."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Leaky Brain' phenomenon is described. Which tight junction proteins are the primary regulators of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) integrity that are often degraded by MMP-9 during neuroinflammation?",
            "options": ["Albumin and Globulin", "Occludin and Claudin-5", "Actin and Myosin", "Cytokeratin and Vimentin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Occludin and Claudin-5 are the critical transmembrane proteins that maintain the tight junctions of the BBB. Their degradation by Matrix Metalloproteinases (like MMP-9) increases BBB permeability."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which characteristic of Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) contributes most significantly to its status as a 'stealth infection' and its ability to survive antibiotic challenges in vitro?",
            "options": ["Its inability to live without a host", "Its rapid replication cycle of 20 minutes", "Its ability to form pleomorphic 'round body' forms and protective biofilms", "Its production of potent exotoxins"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Borrelia is known for its pleomorphic capabilities (changing from spirochete to round bodies/cysts) and its ability to reside within biofilms, which protect the bacteria from both the immune system and antibiotics."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "To meet the diagnostic criteria for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) in an adult, what is the required heart rate increase within 10 minutes of standing (in the absence of orthostatic hypotension)?",
            "options": ["An increase of at least 10 bpm", "An increase of at least 20 bpm", "An increase of at least 30 bpm", "An increase of at least 60 bpm"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In adults, POTS is defined as a heart rate increase of ≥30 beats per minute (bpm) within 10 minutes of standing (or head-up tilt) without a significant drop in blood pressure."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In Integrative Oncology, the 'Warburg Effect' refers to which metabolic shift in cancer cells?",
            "options": ["A shift from glucose metabolism to fatty acid oxidation", "The preference for aerobic glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen", "The total shutdown of the mitochondria", "The inability of cancer cells to utilize glutamine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Warburg Effect is the phenomenon where cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, even when oxygen is plentiful (aerobic glycolysis)."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia is primarily driven by the translocation of which substance across the intestinal barrier into systemic circulation?",
            "options": ["Butyrate", "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)", "Secretory IgA", "Lactobacillus acidophilus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Endotoxemia occurs when Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, translocates into the bloodstream, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation via TLR4 activation."

            "options": ["Thyroid hormone receptors", "Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR-gamma)", "The Insulin receptor", "Voltage-gated calcium channels"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates act as endocrine disruptors and 'obesogens' by activating PPAR-gamma, which triggers adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage, altering metabolic set-points."
