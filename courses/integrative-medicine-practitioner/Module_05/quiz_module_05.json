            "options": [
                "The practitioner's natural urge to fix the patient's problems, which can trigger psychological reactance.",
                "The patient's ability to correct their own course when given sufficient clinical data.",
                "A neurological feedback loop in the basal ganglia that stabilizes new habits.",
                "The process of aligning a patient's values with their health goals through direct persuasion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the practitioner's impulse to provide solutions or 'fix' the patient. This often leads to 'psychological reactance,' where the patient defends their current behavior to assert autonomy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
