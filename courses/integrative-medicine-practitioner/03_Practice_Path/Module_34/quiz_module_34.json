            "question": "According to the neurobiology of group healing (L1), which physiological mechanism is primarily activated when participants experience 'social safety' within a cohort?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight or Flight)",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (Social Engagement System)",
                "The HPA Axis (Stress Response)",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (Freeze Response)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex, part of the Polyvagal Theory, is responsible for social engagement and feelings of safety, which downregulates the stress response and facilitates healing in group settings."

            "question": "In designing high-impact integrative curriculums (L2), what is the purpose of the 'Spiral Learning' model?",
            "options": [
                "To cover as many topics as possible in a short timeframe",
                "To repeat core concepts with increasing complexity throughout the program",
                "To allow participants to skip modules they already understand",
                "To focus exclusively on the most difficult scientific mechanisms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiral Learning involves revisiting key concepts multiple times, adding layers of depth and application each time to ensure mastery and long-term retention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Storming phase, conflict is natural. The facilitator must help the group navigate this by normalizing the tension and using it to establish clear boundaries and roles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tiered Action Plans (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold levels of a habit) allow individuals to customize their experience based on their current capacity while remaining part of the group curriculum."

            "options": [
                "High likelihood of participant referrals",
                "Superior clinical outcomes due to 'quiet' processing",
                "An 80% higher risk of mid-program attrition (dropout)",
                "The need to increase the difficulty of the curriculum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Engagement Velocity tracks how quickly and consistently participants interact. A drop in this metric is a leading indicator that participants are becoming disengaged and are likely to drop out."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For populations with CFS/ME, managing 'Post-Exertional Malaise' is critical. Workshops must be designed with pacing in mind to avoid crashing the participants' energy systems."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a group setting, while the practitioner is bound by HIPAA/professional ethics, participants are not. A Mutual Confidentiality Agreement creates a peer-to-peer contract to protect privacy."

            "explanation": "Meta-analyses of group-based functional medicine and CBT-based pain programs often show 30-40% reductions in pain interference and intensity due to the combined effect of education and social support."
