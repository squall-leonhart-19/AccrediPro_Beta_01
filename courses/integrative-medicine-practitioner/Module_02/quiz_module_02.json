            "question": "In the paradigm shift from symptoms to systems (Lesson 1), what is the primary limitation of the 'one pill for one ill' conventional model when treating chronic disease?",
            "options": [
                "It is too expensive for most patients to maintain long-term.",
                "It focuses on the 'what' (diagnosis) rather than the 'why' (mechanism).",
                "It relies too heavily on lifestyle modifications rather than pharmacology.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conventional medicine often focuses on matching a drug to a diagnosis (the 'what'), whereas integrative medicine seeks to understand the underlying physiological mechanisms and 'why' the symptoms are occurring."
