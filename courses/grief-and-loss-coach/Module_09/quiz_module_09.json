            "question": "According to the DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), what is the minimum duration of symptoms required for an adult diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "3 months following the loss",
                "6 months following the loss",
                "12 months following the loss",
                "24 months following the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5-TR specifies that for adults, the grief response must persist for at least 12 months after the death to meet the criteria for PGD. For children and adolescents, the timeframe is 6 months."

            "question": "In the neurobiology of traumatic loss, what specific interaction between brain regions often leads to the 'flashback' or intrusive memory symptoms seen in clients?",
            "options": [
                "Increased prefrontal cortex regulation of the hippocampus",
                "Hyper-activation of the amygdala paired with decreased top-down inhibition from the prefrontal cortex",
                "Decreased cortisol production in the adrenal glands",
                "Rapid growth of the corpus callosum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traumatic loss often results in a hyper-active amygdala (fear center) and a weakened ability of the prefrontal cortex to regulate this arousal, leading to emotional dysregulation and intrusive memories."

                "A community mourning a local hero after a public accident"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a person's loss cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported, such as the loss of an ex-partner, a pet, or a loss stigmatized by society."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Continuing Bonds Theory, common in many global cultures, suggests that healthy mourning involves maintaining a transformed, ongoing relationship with the deceased rather than 'getting over' them."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bereavement overload (or cumulative loss) occurs when an older adult experiences several losses in rapid succession, leading to a state of chronic mourning and depleted coping resources."

                "Vicarious trauma is caused by too many administrative tasks, while burnout is caused by clients",
                "Vicarious trauma involves a fundamental shift in the coach’s world-view and sense of safety due to exposure to client trauma",
                "Burnout only happens to inexperienced coaches, while vicarious trauma only happens to experts",
                "There is no distinction; they are clinical synonyms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While burnout is related to work environment and exhaustion, vicarious trauma specifically refers to the cognitive shift and psychological erosion that happens when a professional is exposed to the traumatic stories of others."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Aggressive confrontation of their denial",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For hypo-arousal, coaches should use 'titration'—introducing small, manageable amounts of sensory awareness to help the client safely reconnect with their body without becoming overwhelmed."
