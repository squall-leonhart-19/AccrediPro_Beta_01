            "question": "In the Unified Integrative Grief Framework (UIGF), what is the primary distinction from traditional stage-based or linear models of bereavement?",
            "options": [
                "It mandates a specific timeline for the completion of 'grief work'",
                "It views grief as a recursive, multi-dimensional process involving simultaneous cognitive, somatic, and spiritual integration",
                "It focuses exclusively on the cognitive restructuring of the loss",
                "It replaces all previous models with a single, rigid protocol for all clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The UIGF is characterized by its non-linear, recursive nature, acknowledging that integration happens across multiple dimensions (somatic, cognitive, spiritual) simultaneously rather than in sequential stages."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "Advanced neurobiological research into 'Transcendent Meaning' indicates that during the integration of profound loss, which neural network typically shows decreased activity to allow for new perspective-taking and self-transcendence?",
            "options": [
                "The Visual Cortex",
                "The Default Mode Network (DMN)",
                "The Motor Strip",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Downregulation of the Default Mode Network (DMN), particularly the posterior cingulate cortex, is associated with a reduction in self-referential rumination, allowing for the 'transcendent' perspectives required for master-level grief integration."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Mastery in 'Ethical Boundary Fluidity' is best defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The relaxation of ethical standards to build closer friendships with clients",
                "The ability to ignore professional codes of conduct in high-crisis situations",
                "A high-level discernment where boundaries are intentionally and ethically adjusted based on clinical context, cultural needs, and the maturity of the therapeutic alliance",
                "A method of ensuring the coach and client maintain zero personal contact outside of the office"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boundary Fluidity at the Master level is about nuanced, intentional discernment—moving from rigid 'rule-following' to 'ethical wisdom' where boundaries are adapted to serve the client's highest good without causing harm."

            "options": [
                "Using both eyes to observe micro-expressions in the client",
                "Learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledge and from the other eye with the strengths of Western science",
                "The coach and client looking at the same problem from different sides of the room",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Two-Eyed Seeing is a Mi'kmaw concept that encourages practitioners to integrate the best of Western scientific methodologies with the deep, relational wisdom of Indigenous perspectives."

            "question": "According to Longitudinal Trajectory Analysis, research suggests that approximately what percentage of individuals experience a significant 'Grief Surge' 10 to 20 years post-loss, often triggered by major life transitions?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "15-25%",

                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies (Decadal Grief) show that 15-25% of individuals experience significant resurgences of grief during 'milepost' events (like a child's wedding or retirement) even decades after the original loss."

            "question": "In Somatic-Cognitive Synchronization (SCS) during a crisis, why does the Master Coach prioritize 'Bottom-Up' interventions initially?",
            "options": [
                "Because talking is too exhausting for the coach",
                "Because the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is often functionally 'offline' or impaired during high autonomic arousal",
                "Because cognitive interventions are considered ineffective in all grief work",
                "To ensure the client does not remember the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-arousal crisis states, the 'top-down' cognitive centers (PFC) are less accessible; 'bottom-up' somatic interventions (like regulated breathing) stabilize the nervous system first so that cognitive processing can eventually resume."

                "The mentor and the coach are both working with the same client",
                "The dynamics between the coach and the client are unconsciously replicated in the relationship between the coach and the supervisor/mentor",
                "Two coaches share an office space and work on similar cases",
                "A coach experiences a loss at the same time as their client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process is a central concept in supervision where the coach unconsciously acts out the client's patterns with the mentor, providing a valuable diagnostic tool for the supervision process."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Marcus' (Age 58) lost his partner 15 years ago. He is currently experiencing 'anniversary-level' grief intensity as he prepares for retirement. Using the Decadal Trajectory lens, this is most likely:",

                "A sign of 'Prolonged Grief Disorder' requiring clinical psychiatric intervention",
                "A 'Transition-Triggered Decadal Surge' where the loss of professional identity re-opens the integration process",

                "An unrelated depressive episode"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Coaches recognize that major life transitions (like retirement) can trigger 'Decadal Surges' in integrated grief, as the client must re-negotiate the loss within their new identity and lifestyle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indicates a flexible and resilient autonomic nervous system, signaling that the client has moved out of a 'fight/flight/freeze' state and back into a state where integration can occur."
