            "question": "A Master Practitioner notices they are becoming uncharacteristically frustrated with a client's 'lack of progress.' According to the dynamics of countertransference, what is the most likely professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately refer the client to another practitioner to avoid bias.",
                "Disclose the frustration to the client to model radical honesty.",
                "Utilize reflective supervision to identify if this is 'concordant' or 'complementary' countertransference.",
                "Suppress the emotion and strictly adhere to the pre-planned intervention protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners use supervision to distinguish between concordant countertransference (feeling what the client feels) and complementary countertransference (feeling like a person in the client's life), rather than reacting impulsively."

            "question": "In Advanced Somatic Processing for traumatic bereavement, what is the primary purpose of 'titration'?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the intensity of the emotional release to ensure catharsis.",
                "To break down overwhelming traumatic material into small, manageable 'drops' to prevent nervous system flooding.",
                "To move the client's focus exclusively to positive somatic resources.",
                "To measure the exact cortisol levels in the client's system through biofeedback."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a core somatic skill that involves slowing down the processing of trauma so the client remains within their 'Window of Tolerance' without becoming overwhelmed or dissociating."

                "Meaninglessness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all apply, 'The Void' specifically represents the collapse of the client's previous meaning-making structures, requiring the practitioner to facilitate the creation of new meaning from a state of 'meaninglessness.'"

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Research by Yehuda et al. (2016) on Holocaust survivors and their offspring suggests that intergenerational grief can be transmitted via which mechanism?",

                "Epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation of the FKBP5 gene.",
                "Strictly through oral storytelling and family narratives.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found that trauma can leave chemical marks on genes (epigenetics), affecting the stress response (HPA axis) of subsequent generations even if they didn't experience the trauma themselves."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A practitioner is faced with a 'dual relationship' dilemma: a long-term client invites them to a private, small-scale ritual for a deceased child. What is the ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Always refuse, as any contact outside the office is a boundary violation.",
                "Attend only if the practitioner can bill for the time as a standard session.",
                "Evaluate the clinical impact on the 'therapeutic container' and the potential for role confusion.",
                "Attend to show support, as master-level practitioners do not need to worry about boundaries."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master-level ethics recognize that 'boundary crossings' (like attending a ritual) may be therapeutic, but must be carefully weighed against the risk of 'boundary violations' and the impact on the professional relationship."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eye 3 focuses on the relational space and the unconscious dynamics occurring between the practitioner and the client during the session."

            "options": [
                "VT is simply the absence of burnout symptoms.",
                "VT involves a fundamental shift in the practitioner’s worldview and spiritual growth resulting from witnessing client resilience.",
                "VT is a clinical term for taking a vacation to recover from secondary trauma.",
                "VT refers to the client’s transformation, not the practitioner’s."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Transformation goes beyond just feeling good about work (satisfaction); it describes how the practitioner is deeply and positively changed by the 'post-traumatic growth' they witness in clients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses of somatic therapies (like Somatic Experiencing or Sensorimotor Psychotherapy) consistently show large effect sizes (around 0.8-0.9) for reducing PTSD and traumatic grief symptoms compared to talk therapy alone."

            "explanation": "In systemic ancestral work, the goal of a Resilience Genogram is to shift the narrative from 'inherited trauma' to 'inherited resilience,' helping the client find resources within their lineage."
