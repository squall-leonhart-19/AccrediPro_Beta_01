            "options": [
                "Normative needs are defined by experts and clinical data; felt needs are what the community members themselves perceive they require.",
                "Normative needs represent the emotional desires of the group; felt needs represent the physical resources available.",
                "Normative needs are only relevant in clinical settings; felt needs are only relevant in peer-led coaching.",
                "Normative needs refer to the cost of the program; felt needs refer to the duration of the program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Normative needs are established by professional standards and data (e.g., mortality rates vs. available services), whereas felt needs are the subjective requirements expressed by the grieving population."

                "The first 6 weeks should be exclusively loss-oriented, and the last 6 weeks exclusively restoration-oriented.",
                "The program should force participants to stay in loss-orientation until they reach 'closure'.",
                "The curriculum should facilitate oscillation between loss-oriented work (processing the death) and restoration-oriented work (rebuilding life).",
                "The program should avoid restoration-oriented work as it is considered a form of avoidance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective scaffolding in grief work mirrors the Dual Process Model, allowing participants to oscillate between processing the pain of loss and developing new life skills and identities."
