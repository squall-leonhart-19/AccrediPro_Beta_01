                "24 months following the loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For adults, the DSM-5-TR specifies that the grief response must persist for at least 12 months after the death to meet the diagnostic criteria for PGD. For children and adolescents, the timeframe is 6 months."

            "question": "Which neurological structure is primarily associated with the 'yearning' and 'craving' aspects of grief, often functioning similarly to the brain's response to addiction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the nucleus accumbens, part of the brain's reward system, is activated during periods of yearning. This explains why 'complicated grief' can feel like an addiction to the presence of the deceased."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility is a lifelong commitment to self-evaluation and critique, acknowledging that one can never be 'expert' in another's culture, whereas competence often suggests an end-point of knowledge."
