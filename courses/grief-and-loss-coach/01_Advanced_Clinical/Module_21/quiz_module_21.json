            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "When utilizing the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) during an advanced assessment (L1), what score is typically used as the clinical threshold indicating a high risk for Prolonged Grief Disorder?",
            "options": ["15 or higher", "25 or higher", "40 or higher", "50 or higher"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (Prigerson et al.) establishes that a score of 25 or higher on the ICG is the standard threshold for identifying individuals at high risk for clinically significant complications in the grieving process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the HEART Framework for collaborative goal setting (L2), what does the 'R' represent to ensure goals are contextually relevant to the client's life?",
            "options": ["Reasonable", "Relational", "Rigorous", "Resilient"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the HEART framework (Holistic, Empathetic, Actionable, Relational, Timely), 'Relational' ensures that goals consider the client's social support systems and their ongoing bond with the deceased."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to Phase-Based Intervention Mapping (L3), which intervention is most appropriate for a client in the 'Acute Stabilization' phase?",
            "options": ["Meaning-reconstruction exercises", "Legacy project development", "Grounding techniques and routine establishment", "Relational shadow work"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first phase of intervention mapping focuses on stabilization, which requires somatic grounding and the restoration of daily routines before moving into deeper cognitive or meaning-making work."

        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "Based on the DSM-5-TR criteria discussed in Lesson 4, what is the minimum duration of symptoms required to diagnose an adult with Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD)?",
            "options": ["3 months", "6 months", "12 months", "24 months"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the ICD-11 uses a 6-month threshold, the DSM-5-TR requires that the death occurred at least 12 months ago for an adult to meet the diagnostic criteria for PGD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "When integrating Polyvagal Theory into a treatment plan (L5), a client experiencing 'numbness, dissociation, and hopelessness' is likely in which autonomic state?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)", "Sympathetic (Fight/Flight)", "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown)", "Hyper-arousal"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and a 'freeze' or 'shutdown' response, common in profound or traumatic grief."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes that the 'Safety Planning Intervention (SPI)' is superior to 'No-Suicide Contracts' because it:",
            "options": ["Is a legally binding document", "Focuses on internal coping strategies and social distractions", "Requires the client to promise they won't self-harm", "Eliminates the need for emergency referrals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that 'No-Suicide Contracts' are ineffective and may increase liability. The SPI is a collaborative, evidence-based tool that provides the client with specific coping steps and resources."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In Outcome Measurement (L7), what is the primary purpose of calculating the Reliable Change Index (RCI)?",
            "options": ["To determine if the client likes the coach", "To ensure the coach is following ethical guidelines", "To determine if a change in scores is statistically significant and not due to measurement error", "To compare the client's progress against national averages"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The RCI is a statistical tool used to determine if the improvement (or decline) in a client's assessment scores over time is large enough to be considered a real change rather than a random fluctuation."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (45) is ending her coaching after 12 sessions. She has met her goals but expresses anxiety about 'doing it alone.' According to L8, what is the most ethical approach?",
            "options": ["Immediately terminate to prevent dependency", "Extend the contract indefinitely to provide comfort", "Schedule 'booster sessions' or a tapering schedule to facilitate autonomy", "Refer her to a new coach to start over"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical termination involves planning. Tapering sessions (e.g., moving from weekly to monthly) allows the client to practice their new skills while still having a safety net, fostering confidence and autonomy."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Which documentation format is specifically recommended in Lesson 8 for capturing the 'Plan' for the next session based on clinical observations?",
            "options": ["BIRP Notes", "DAP Notes", "SOAP Notes", "GRIEF Notes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes are the gold standard in professional documentation for tracking progress and ensuring continuity of care."

            "options": ["2-3%", "10% (roughly 1 in 10)", "25% (1 in 4)", "50% (1 in 2)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analytic data consistently shows that while most people navigate grief successfully, approximately 9.8% to 10% of bereaved individuals develop PGD, requiring specialized intervention planning."
