            "question": "In the Multi-Dimensional Grief Synthesis Model (MDGSM), how is 'Synthesis' fundamentally distinguished from the traditional concept of 'Closure'?",
            "options": [
                "Synthesis requires the total cessation of emotional pain, whereas closure allows for lingering sadness.",
                "Synthesis focuses on integrating the deceased into the survivor's ongoing life and identity, while closure implies moving on from the relationship.",
                "Synthesis is a linear process with five distinct stages, whereas closure is a circular process.",
                "Synthesis is only applicable to disenfranchised grief, while closure applies to standard bereavement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis, as taught in the MDGSM, views the loss as a permanent part of the client's narrative that must be integrated into their identity, rather than a chapter that is 'closed' or moved on from."

                "Overgeneralization of the deceased's negative traits.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced CBT Synthesis identifies that survivors often experience guilt through a lens of 'Moral Grandiosity'—the false belief that they had more control over the death than they actually did (Omnipotence/Personalization)."

            "question": "According to the Neurobiology of Synthesis (Lesson 3), what role does 'Pendulation' play in somatic integration?",
            "options": [
                "It forces the client to remain in a state of hyper-arousal to 'burn out' the trauma response.",
                "It involves oscillating the client's attention between a 'resource' (place of safety) and the somatic 'activation' (grief sensation) to expand the Window of Tolerance.",
                "It is a cognitive technique used to debate the logic of the client's grief.",
                "It is a rhythmic breathing exercise designed to induce immediate sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation is a somatic technique that helps clients process grief by gently moving between a state of regulation (resource) and a state of dysregulation (activation), preventing flooding."

                "To build a physical memorial in the community.",
                "To create a narrative link between the client's 'Self' before the loss and their 'Self' after the loss.",
                "To bridge the gap between different family members' conflicting memories."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Biographical Bridge is a narrative synthesis tool used to maintain identity continuity, helping the client understand how they are the same person despite the catastrophic change in their life."

                "Ensure the client does not take responsibility for their own healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalization allows the client to move from 'I am depressed' to 'Grief is following me today,' which creates the psychological distance necessary to manage and synthesize the experience."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Double-Listen' technique is a narrative synthesis tool used to hear both the story of the loss and the 'sub-plot' of how the client has survived or responded to it, which is crucial for identity reconstruction."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
