            "question": "In Somatic Integration (L1), why is 'bottom-up' processing prioritized over 'top-down' cognitive interventions for clients with traumatic grief?",
            "options": [
                "Because cognitive interventions are ineffective for grief-related depression.",
                "To regulate the autonomic nervous system and address physiological arousal before attempting meaning-making.",
                "Because the prefrontal cortex is hyper-active during acute grief.",
                "To ensure the client can articulate their feelings more clearly to the coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up processing addresses the physiological state and the 'felt sense' in the body. Since traumatic grief often keeps the nervous system in a state of hyper- or hypo-arousal, the body must be regulated before higher-level cognitive narrative work can be effective."

            "question": "According to Neimeyer's research on Narrative Reconstruction (L2), what is the primary indicator of a client's 'Narrative Coherence'?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to recount the death event without showing any visible emotion.",
                "The length of the written journal entries provided during the coaching sessions.",
                "The integration of the loss into a chronological life story that links events, emotions, and personal meaning.",
                "The client's ability to completely stop thinking about the deceased."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative coherence is defined by the client's ability to weave the loss into their larger life story in a way that makes sense (meaning-making) and maintains a logical, emotional, and chronological flow."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt coaching focuses on the 'here and now.' The Empty Chair technique allows the client to externalize their internal conflict or unspoken words, facilitating a dialogue with the deceased to achieve closure or resolution."

                "It serves as a distraction from the pain of the coaching session.",
                "It is a diagnostic tool used to label the client's specific mental health condition.",
                "It acts as a bridge or externalized medium (e.g., a painting or poem) that allows the client to explore grief safely from a distance.",
                "It represents the coach's interpretation of the client's progress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Third Object' (the art itself) provides 'aesthetic distance,' allowing the client to project their internal state onto an external medium, making the grief easier to observe, manipulate, and understand."

            "question": "A client is exclusively focused on 'Restoration-Oriented' stressors (e.g., finances, new identity) and refuses to discuss the loss itself. According to the Dual Process Model (L5), what is the most appropriate coaching focus?",

                "Respect the client's choice and stay exclusively in Restoration-Oriented work.",
                "Gently facilitate 'oscillation' by introducing small doses of Loss-Oriented reflection to prevent avoidance-related burnout.",
                "Tell the client they are in denial and must focus on the pain immediately.",
                "Refer the client to a financial advisor instead of a grief coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DPM emphasizes 'oscillation.' While restoration is necessary, chronic avoidance of the loss (Loss-Oriented stressors) can lead to complications. The coach's role is to help the client move back and forth between the two domains."

                "Through the client's deep, overwhelming feelings of worthlessness.",
                "Through behaviors like hyper-productivity, intellectualization, or 'staying busy' to keep the pain of grief (the Exile) at bay.",
                "Through impulsive behaviors like substance abuse or self-harm.",
                "As the 'Self' which remains calm and compassionate during the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Managers are proactive protector parts. In grief, they often try to control the environment or the client's internal state through productivity or intellectualization to ensure the system doesn't 'collapse' from the pain of the loss."

                "A 10% increase in client satisfaction scores.",
                "No significant change in Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) symptoms.",
                "A significant reduction in PGD symptoms with high effect sizes (d > 1.0) compared to supportive counseling alone.",
                "An increase in the client's reliance on the coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that identifying and restructuring maladaptive cognitions (unhelpful thoughts about the self or the death) is one of the most effective components of CBGC for reducing severe grief symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Liminal phase is the 'in-between' state where the old identity is gone but the new identity isn't yet formed. Rituals help the client navigate this space so they can eventually reach 'Reincorporation.'"

            "question": "During a Somatic Integration session, a client becomes 'flooded' (overwhelmed by physical sensation). Which technique should the coach use to safely return them to the 'Window of Tolerance'?",

                "Catharsis: Encourage them to scream and release the energy all at once.",
                "Titration: Slow down the process and focus on a very small, manageable 'sliver' of the physical sensation.",
                "Exposure: Force the client to stay with the feeling until it dissipates.",
                "Distraction: Change the subject to something unrelated to grief."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the somatic process of experiencing small amounts of 'activation' at a time to prevent the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring the client stays within their Window of Tolerance."

                "To return to the exact same belief system the client had before the loss.",
                "To prove that the client's previous beliefs were incorrect.",
                "To develop a 'Post-Traumatic Growth' narrative where the loss is integrated and the client finds a renewed sense of purpose or meaning.",
                "To help the client forget the details of the trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced narrative work aims for the reconstruction of a personal mythology that accounts for the loss, allowing for post-traumatic growth and a revised sense of self that is resilient and meaningful."
