            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Because pet owners do not experience the same physiological stress responses as those who lose humans",
                "Because the loss is not socially sanctioned or validated by broad societal mourning rituals",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Advise the client that 3 days is the clinical standard for recovery and they may need medication",
                "Suggest that the 'brain fog' is a sign they have failed to reach the 'Acceptance' stage of grief"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model suggests that healthy grieving involves oscillating between Loss-Orientation (grief work) and Restoration-Orientation (attending to life changes). Brain fog is a common part of this adjustment period."
