            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circadian biology dictates that insulin sensitivity is highest in the morning and declines as the day progresses; eating late at night conflicts with this natural metabolic rhythm."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A client's CGM data shows a 'Standard Deviation' (SD) of 35 mg/dL. According to the Glycemic Variability lesson, what does this indicate about their metabolic health?",

                "Excellent stability; the goal for SD is typically under 50 mg/dL.",
                "High variability; an SD over 20-25 mg/dL suggests significant glucose 'rollercoasters' and oxidative stress.",
                "Low variability; this person is likely in a state of chronic hypoglycemia.",
                "Irrelevant data; only HbA1c matters for metabolic health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard Deviation (SD) measures the spread of glucose readings. In functional nutrition, an SD over 20-25 mg/dL is often flagged as high glycemic variability, even if HbA1c is normal."
