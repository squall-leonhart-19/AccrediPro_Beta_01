            "question": "During the 'North-to-South' process of digestion, approximately what percentage of gastric secretions are triggered during the Cephalic Phase before food even enters the stomach?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cephalic Phase, triggered by the sight, smell, or thought of food, accounts for roughly 30-40% of total gastric acid secretion, highlighting the importance of a relaxed state for optimal digestion."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gut rather than the brain?",
