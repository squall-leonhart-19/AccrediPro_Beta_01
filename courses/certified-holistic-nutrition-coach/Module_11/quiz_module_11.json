            "question": "In the context of Environmental Toxins (L1), which specific mechanism describes how 'obesogens' like Tributyltin (TBT) promote weight gain independently of caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "By inhibiting the release of ghrelin in the stomach lining",
                "By activating the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), which triggers adipocyte differentiation",
                "By increasing the thermal effect of food (TEF) through mitochondrial uncoupling",
                "By blocking the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obesogens like TBT act as endocrine disruptors that activate PPAR-γ, the master regulator of adipogenesis, leading to an increase in the number and size of fat cells regardless of diet."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to advanced microbiome sequencing data (L2), a high 'Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes' ratio is often associated with which clinical observation?",
            "options": [
                "Increased efficiency in energy harvest from the diet and higher BMI",

                "Optimal mucosal immunity and high Alpha-diversity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A higher F/B ratio is a common marker in dysbiosis research (n=1,200+ meta-analysis) associated with obesity, as Firmicutes are more efficient at extracting energy/calories from dietary fiber."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism (L3) exhibits a 70% reduction in enzyme activity. Which nutritional intervention is most scientifically sound for this genetic profile?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The C677T mutation impairs the conversion of folate to its active form; providing the methylated form (5-MTHF) bypasses the defective enzyme and supports the methylation cycle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates pure lipid (fat) oxidation, which is a hallmark of high metabolic flexibility and successful adaptation to fasting or ketogenic protocols."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "The concept of 'Molecular Mimicry' in Autoimmune Support (L5) suggests that the immune system attacks 'self' tissues because:",

                "The body has run out of white blood cells to fight external pathogens",

                "High sugar intake causes the blood to become acidic, dissolving joint tissue",
                "Antibodies are produced too slowly to distinguish between viruses and bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the amino acid sequence of a foreign antigen (like gluten) resembles a self-protein, leading the immune system to cross-react and attack the body's own tissues."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Neurobiological studies (L6) show that chronic exposure to hyper-palatable foods (high sugar/fat) results in which change in the Nucleus Accumbens?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Similar to drug addiction, chronic overstimulation of the reward system leads to a decrease (downregulation) of D2 receptors, creating a 'reward deficiency' that drives overeating."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peripheral inflammation triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that communicate with the brain to induce sickness behavior, a survival mechanism to conserve energy during infection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Optimization phase focuses on refining the protocol (e.g., adjusting carb cycling or fasting windows) once the foundational 'Nutrition' and 'Understanding' phases are established."
