            "question": "In the context of the Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle), which enzyme serves as the primary rate-limiting step and is inhibited by high levels of ATP and NADH?",
            "options": [
                "Isocitrate dehydrogenase",
                "Citrate synthase",
                "Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase",
                "Succinate dehydrogenase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase is the primary rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle. It is allosterically activated by ADP and inhibited by ATP and NADH, reflecting the energy status of the cell."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of micronutrient synergy, why is high-dose Zinc supplementation (e.g., >50mg/day) contraindicated without supervising Copper levels?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc and Copper compete for the same transport protein, albumin, in the blood.",
                "Zinc induces the synthesis of metallothionein, which preferentially binds and sequesters Copper in intestinal cells.",
                "Zinc inhibits the absorption of Vitamin C, which is required for Copper solubility.",
                "Excess Zinc increases renal excretion of Copper through the proximal tubules."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High zinc intake induces the intestinal protein metallothionein. Metallothionein has a higher affinity for copper than zinc, trapping copper within the enterocyte and preventing its absorption, which can lead to a secondary copper deficiency."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated Homocysteine (16 µmol/L) despite adequate intake of Folate and B12. Which secondary pathway, utilizing Trimethylglycine (TMG), might be under-functioning?",

                "The Glutathione Peroxidase pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BHMT pathway is an alternative route for homocysteine remethylation into methionine, occurring primarily in the liver and kidneys, using betaine (TMG) as a methyl donor."

                "Complex IV (Cytochrome c oxidase)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Complex IV (Cytochrome c oxidase) is the final enzyme in the ETC, transferring electrons to oxygen to form water. It is a major site of inhibition for various mitochondrial toxins."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Regarding advanced insulin signaling, what is the specific role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in glucose homeostasis?",
            "options": [
                "It triggers the phosphorylation of the Insulin Receptor substrate (IRS) to stop glucose uptake.",

                "It converts excess glucose directly into glycogen in the mitochondria.",
                "It stimulates the alpha-cells of the pancreas to release glucagon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PI3K/Akt signaling cascade is the primary mechanism by which insulin triggers the movement of GLUT4 transporters from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface, allowing glucose to enter muscle and fat cells."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In advanced Lipidomics, why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) considered a superior predictor of cardiovascular risk compared to standard LDL-C?",
            "options": [
                "ApoB measures the amount of cholesterol inside the particles.",

                "ApoB reflects the triglyceride content of the diet over the last 3 months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Each atherogenic particle (VLDL, IDL, and LDL) contains exactly one molecule of ApoB. Therefore, measuring ApoB provides an accurate count of the total number of particles capable of entering the arterial wall, regardless of how much cholesterol they carry."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "To optimize the synthesis of Serotonin via Amino Acid Therapy, Tryptophan should be administered with a small amount of carbohydrate and away from high-protein meals. What is the biochemical rationale for this?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin lowers the blood levels of Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs) that compete with Tryptophan for the LAT1 transporter.",

                "Protein inhibits the enzyme Tryptophan Hydroxylase.",
                "Tryptophan is fat-soluble and requires insulin for absorption into the lymphatic system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan competes with other LNAAs (like Leucine and Valine) for transport across the blood-brain barrier. Insulin secretion causes the uptake of these competing amino acids into muscle tissue, effectively increasing the Tryptophan-to-LNAA ratio and allowing more Tryptophan to enter the brain."

                "Approximately 95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T homozygous (TT) genotype results in a significantly thermolabile enzyme with roughly a 70-75% reduction in activity, leading to impaired folate metabolism and potential hyperhomocysteinemia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Variants in the FTO gene are strongly associated with increased BMI and obesity risk, primarily through mechanisms that influence appetite, reward-seeking behavior, and a reduced response to satiety hormones like ghrelin."

                "10x"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small dense LDL (Pattern B) particles are more easily oxidized, have a higher affinity for the arterial wall, and stay in circulation longer. Meta-analyses consistently show a roughly 3-fold increase in cardiovascular risk for Pattern B individuals compared to Pattern A."
