            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Metabolic flexibility is defined by the body's ability to switch between substrate oxidation. Which Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) value indicates a state of pure lipid (fat) oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "0.70",
                "0.85",
                "1.00",
                "1.20"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that the body is deriving 100% of its energy from fat oxidation, while an RER of 1.00 indicates 100% glucose oxidation."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the Gut-Brain-Skin axis, which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is most critical for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and suppressing systemic inflammation that leads to acne and dermatitis?",

                "Valerate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the primary fuel for colonocytes and plays a vital role in maintaining the 'tight junctions' of the gut barrier, reducing the systemic inflammatory load that triggers skin conditions."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which Phase II detoxification pathway is specifically responsible for the neutralization of Bisphenol A (BPA) and other xenoestrogens before they are excreted via bile or urine?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation, mediated by UGT enzymes, is the primary pathway for detoxifying BPA and many other environmental endocrine disruptors."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a homozygous MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Based on nutritional genomics, which form of folate is most bioavailable to bypass this genetic bottleneck?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The C677T mutation reduces the enzyme's ability to convert folate into its active form; therefore, supplementing with the methylated form (5-MTHF) directly provides the active metabolite."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "During therapeutic fasting, the suppression of which nutrient-sensing pathway is the primary trigger for the initiation of macroautophagy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While AMPK activation promotes autophagy, it is the downregulation of mTOR—the body's primary growth and protein synthesis regulator—that serves as the master 'on' switch for cellular recycling."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "To prevent the 'Calcium Paradox' (where calcium deposits in arteries rather than bones), which micronutrient must be present to activate Matrix Gla Protein (MGP)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 is the essential cofactor for the carboxylation of Matrix Gla Protein, which inhibits arterial calcification, and Osteocalcin, which binds calcium to the bone matrix."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In Neuro-Nutrition, 'Food Addiction' is often linked to the downregulation of which receptors in the brain's reward center (nucleus accumbens) due to chronic overstimulation by hyper-palatable foods?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic consumption of high-sugar/high-fat foods leads to a reduction in Dopamine D2 receptor density, requiring higher amounts of the 'substance' to achieve the same reward (tolerance)."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client with metabolic syndrome has a fasting insulin of 22 μIU/mL. Why might they experience significant 'brain fog' and fatigue when attempting a 24-hour fast?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated insulin prevents the mobilization of fatty acids (lipolysis)",
                "They are experiencing a 'healing crisis' from autophagy",
                "Their body is overproducing ketones too quickly",
                "Fasting has induced a temporary Vitamin B1 deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High fasting insulin (hyperinsulinemia) acts as a metabolic brake on lipolysis. Even in a fasted state, the body cannot access stored fat effectively, leading to a temporary energy crisis (cellular starvation)."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which micronutrient antagonism is most clinically relevant when a client is supplementing with high doses of Zinc (>50mg/day) for more than 4 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc induces the synthesis of metallothionein, which traps Copper and prevents its absorption",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excessive Zinc intake stimulates the production of metallothionein in the intestinal mucosa, which has a higher affinity for Copper, leading to a secondary Copper deficiency."
