            "question": "In the context of the Holistic Paradigm (Lesson 1), how does 'systems thinking' differ from the traditional reductionist approach to nutrition?",
            "options": [
                "Systems thinking focuses exclusively on the caloric density of macronutrients.",
                "Reductionism views the body as a collection of independent parts, while systems thinking views it as an integrated web of biological feedback loops.",
                "Systems thinking ignores biochemical individuality in favor of standardized RDA guidelines.",
                "Reductionism is the only scientifically validated method for clinical intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The holistic paradigm moves beyond reductionism (treating parts in isolation) to systems thinking, recognizing that an intervention in one area (e.g., gut health) inevitably impacts others (e.g., neurotransmitter production and mood)."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) principles, what percentage of the body's total serotonin is estimated to be produced in the enteric nervous system (the gut)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 60-70%",
                "Approximately 90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlights the 'Mind-Body-Gut Axis,' noting that roughly 90-95% of serotonin is produced in the gut, illustrating why digestive health is paramount for emotional and psychological well-being."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 3 found that chronic activation of the HPA axis leads to 'Metabolic Inflexibility.' What is the primary mechanism for this?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol-induced gluconeogenesis and the inhibition of GLUT4 translocation, leading to systemic insulin resistance.",
                "Excessive adrenaline production causing a permanent shift into fat-burning mode (ketosis).",
                "The suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) leading to rapid weight loss.",
                "A decrease in ghrelin production which causes chronic under-eating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress keeps cortisol elevated, which triggers the liver to produce glucose and prevents muscle cells from effectively taking up that glucose (via GLUT4 inhibition), resulting in insulin resistance."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Circadian Biology. A landmark study on sleep deprivation showed that just one night of 4-hour sleep can reduce insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "12%",
                "25%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that acute, short-term sleep deprivation has a profound effect on metabolic health, reducing peripheral insulin sensitivity by up to 25%, comparable to the metabolic profile of a Type 2 diabetic."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "When addressing the 'Total Toxic Burden' (Lesson 5), which phase of liver detoxification involves 'conjugation'—the process of attaching a molecule (like glutathione or an amino acid) to a toxin to make it water-soluble?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I (Cytochrome P450)",
                "Phase II (Conjugation Pathways)",
                "Phase III (Elimination)",
                "Phase IV (Intracellular Neutralization)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification is the conjugation phase. If Phase I is too fast and Phase II is too slow, highly reactive intermediate metabolites can cause significant cellular damage."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "The 'Roseto Effect,' discussed in Lesson 6, demonstrated that a specific factor could lower the incidence of heart disease even in the presence of high-fat diets and smoking. What was that factor?",
            "options": [
                "High intake of polyphenols from red wine",
                "Genetic mutations unique to the Italian-American population",

                "High-altitude living which improved cardiovascular capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Roseto Effect is a classic study in the Social Determinants of Health, showing that social connection and community support can provide a 'protective buffer' against chronic disease and stress."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, the 'Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction' is described. How can a coach differentiate this 'Healing Crisis' from a genuine worsening of a client's condition?",
            "options": [
                "A healing crisis is always accompanied by a high fever, whereas disease progression is not.",
                "A healing crisis is typically short-lived (24-72 hours) and is often followed by a significant increase in energy and symptom resolution.",
                "A healing crisis only occurs when a client stops taking all supplements.",
                "There is no difference; any negative symptom means the protocol must be stopped immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healing crisis (Herxheimer) is a temporary reaction as the body detoxifies or pathogens die off. It is characterized by its transient nature and the 'breakthrough' of improved health that follows."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Within the NOURISH™ Integration framework (Lesson 8), the 'R' stands for 'Restorative Rhythms.' Which of the following is a primary application of this pillar?",
            "options": [
                "Calculating the exact ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 fatty acids.",

                "Focusing exclusively on removing environmental endocrine disruptors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restorative Rhythms focus on the timing of light, sleep, and food. Aligning the 'feeding window' with the natural circadian cycle is a core strategy of this pillar."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which specific statistic from Lesson 4 highlights the impact of blue light on melatonin suppression?",
            "options": [
                "Blue light exposure at 9 PM reduces melatonin by 10%.",
                "Exposure to room light (approx. 200 lux) before bedtime suppresses melatonin levels by over 50% in 99% of individuals.",
                "Blue light has no impact on melatonin if the client is wearing earplugs.",
                "Reading a paper book suppresses melatonin more than an e-reader."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The lesson notes that standard indoor lighting is bright enough to significantly suppress melatonin production, delaying the biological signal for sleep and disrupting metabolic repair."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'unexplained' weight gain, high perceived stress, and poor sleep. Using the NOURISH™ Integration, what is the most logical first step?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately place them on a 1,200 calorie deficit to force weight loss.",

                "Focus only on the 'N' (Nutrient Density) and ignore the sleep and stress factors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The NOURISH™ framework emphasizes that metabolic healing cannot occur in a state of high physiological stress. Managing the HPA axis (Stress) and gut/sleep (Internal Environment) provides the foundation for successful weight management."
