            "question": "According to the NOURISH Method™ outlined in Lesson 1, what is the primary limitation of the 'Calories In, Calories Out' (CICO) model in holistic practice?",
            "options": [
                "It fails to account for the thermic effect of food (TEF).",
                "It ignores the hormonal and epigenetic impact of nutrient quality on metabolic set-point.",
                "It is too difficult for clients to track accurately over long periods.",
                "It overestimates the amount of energy absorbed by the small intestine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NOURISH Method™ emphasizes that while energy balance matters, the 'Paradigm Shift' recognizes that food is information. Different macronutrients trigger different hormonal responses (e.g., insulin vs. glucagon) and epigenetic expressions that dictate metabolic health beyond mere caloric volume."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2 regarding metabolic flexibility suggests that an ideal 'Respiratory Exchange Ratio' (RER) in a fasted state should be closest to which value?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 (indicating pure carbohydrate oxidation)",
                "0.85 (indicating a 50/50 mix of fuels)",
                "0.70 (indicating efficient fatty acid oxidation)",
                "1.2 (indicating anaerobic glycolysis)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 in a fasted state indicates that the body is efficiently utilizing fatty acids for fuel. Metabolic flexibility is the ability to shift between 0.70 (fasted/fats) and 1.0 (fed/carbs) based on substrate availability."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When monitoring a client's Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data, what is the target 'Coefficient of Variation' (CV) percentage to ensure low Glycemic Variability and minimal oxidative stress?",
            "options": [
                "Below 36%",
                "Exactly 50%",

                "Below 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As detailed in Lesson 3, a CV below 36% is the clinical benchmark for stable glucose. Levels above this indicate high glycemic variability, which is independently associated with increased glycation and vascular damage."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which amino acid is considered the 'anabolic trigger' due to its role in activating the mTORC1 pathway, and what is the required threshold per meal for older adults?",
            "options": [
                "Glutamine; 5 grams",
                "Leucine; 2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "Lysine; 1.5 grams",
                "Arginine; 10 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 explains the 'Leucine Threshold' concept. Approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of Leucine are required per bolus of protein to maximally stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS), particularly in aging populations who face anabolic resistance."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Functional Lipid' profile of a healthy cell membrane is discussed. What is the recommended target ratio of Omega-6 (LA) to Omega-3 (ALA/EPA/DHA) to prevent systemic pro-inflammatory signaling?",

                "1:10 (Omega-3 dominant)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet often reaches 16:1 or higher, holistic nutrition targets a ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 to balance the production of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving eicosanoids."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is a mandatory co-factor for over 300 enzymatic reactions, including all reactions involving ATP, making it foundational for energy metabolism and DNA synthesis."

                "Inducing a mild cellular stress response that activates longevity genes like Nrf2.",
                "Binding to glucose molecules to prevent their absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Xenohormesis is the theory that plants under stress produce bioactive compounds that, when consumed by humans, trigger protective stress-response pathways (like Nrf2 and SIRT1), enhancing our own cellular resilience."

            "options": [
                "Supplementing with high-dose synthetic Folic Acid.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The C677T polymorphism reduces the efficiency of the MTHFR enzyme. Clients benefit from the 'active' form of folate (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate) and B2 (riboflavin), which acts as a co-factor for the enzyme."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistant starch (found in cooked and cooled potatoes/rice) is a potent prebiotic that is fermented by gut bacteria into Butyrate, which provides 70% of the energy needed by the cells lining the colon."

                "Peanut Butter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Animal-based proteins, particularly dairy and eggs, consistently score above 1.0 on the DIAAS scale, meaning they provide more than 100% of the required indispensable amino acids per gram of protein compared to plant sources like wheat or soy."
