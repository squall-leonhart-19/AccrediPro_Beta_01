            "question": "According to the McEwen model of stress, how does 'allostatic load' differ from 'homeostasis'?",
            "options": [
                "Homeostasis refers to the dynamic process of adaptation, while allostatic load is the baseline state.",
                "Allostatic load represents the cumulative 'wear and tear' on the body from chronic over-activation of adaptive mechanisms.",
                "Homeostasis is only maintained by the HPA axis, while allostatic load involves the thyroid only.",
                "Allostatic load is a healthy state of metabolic flexibility achieved through exercise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Homeostasis refers to maintaining a stable internal environment (like pH), while allostasis is the process of achieving stability through change. Allostatic load is the physiological cost of chronic exposure to fluctuating or elevated neural or neuroendocrine responses."

            "question": "In the context of Glycemic Control, what does a 2021 meta-analysis suggest is the optimal 'functional range' for fasting insulin to minimize cardiovascular risk, even if the lab 'normal' range is much broader?",
            "options": [
                "2.0 – 5.0 uIU/mL",
                "8.0 – 12.0 uIU/mL",
                "15.0 – 25.0 uIU/mL",
                "Fasting insulin is not a relevant marker for cardiovascular risk."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While lab reference ranges often go up to 24 uIU/mL, functional medicine and recent longevity studies suggest that fasting insulin levels between 2 and 5 uIU/mL indicate optimal insulin sensitivity and lower metabolic risk."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Based on Lesson 3, what does this physiological finding typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "An overactive sympathetic nervous system response.",
                "Excessive production of pregnenolone in the adrenal cortex.",
                "Reduced HPA axis resilience and potential hippocampal dysfunction.",
                "A normal response to high-intensity interval training (HIIT)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a distinct rise in cortisol (usually 50-75%) within 30-45 minutes of waking. A flat CAR is associated with chronic fatigue, burnout, and impaired hippocampal function, indicating a lack of HPA axis resilience."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which set of factors is most likely to trigger the peripheral conversion of T4 into Reverse T3 (rT3) instead of the active T3?",
            "options": [
                "High intake of selenium and moderate exercise.",
                "Optimized Vitamin D levels and adequate calorie intake.",
                "Low levels of iodine and excess magnesium.",
                "Systemic inflammation, chronic calorie restriction, and high cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 acts as a 'brake' on metabolism. It is increased during times of stress, illness, or starvation as the body attempts to conserve energy by shunting T4 away from active T3 production."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the '2-OH to 16-OH' ratio is discussed regarding estrogen metabolism. Which enzyme is responsible for the Phase II methylation of 2-hydroxyestrone to prevent it from becoming DNA-damaging quinones?",
            "options": [
                "CYP1B1",
                "COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase)",
                "Aromatase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "COMT is the enzyme responsible for methylating catechol estrogens (like 2-OH and 4-OH). If COMT activity is sluggish (due to genetics or nutrient deficiencies like Magnesium/B12), these intermediates can oxidize into harmful quinones."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "What is the primary role of the NF-κB (Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) transcription factor in chronic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a 'master switch' that triggers the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
                "It functions as an antioxidant that neutralizes reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria.",
                "It suppresses the Th1 immune response to favor the Th2 response.",
                "It increases the production of melatonin in the pineal gland."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "NF-κB is a protein complex that controls cytokine production and cell survival. Chronic activation of NF-κB is a hallmark of systemic inflammation and is triggered by stress, hyperglycemia, and toxins."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Mitochondrial biogenesis—the creation of new mitochondria—is primarily regulated by which 'master regulator' molecule?",
            "options": [
                "Hemoglobin A1c",
                "Reverse T3",
                "PGC-1α (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha)",
                "Homocysteine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PGC-1α is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. It is activated by signals such as exercise, cold exposure, and certain phytonutrients (like resveratrol), leading to increased cellular energy capacity."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "How does exposure to blue light (460-480nm) specifically affect the Circadian Biology of a client when experienced in the late evening?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the release of adenosine, making the client sleepier.",
                "It increases the conversion of serotonin to melatonin in the gut.",
                "It has no effect on the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) after sunset.",
                "It suppresses the pineal gland's secretion of melatonin via the melanopsin receptors in the retina."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Blue light is the strongest zeitgeber (time-giver) for the SCN. Evening exposure signals the brain that it is daytime, inhibiting the natural rise of melatonin and disrupting the sleep-wake cycle."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 38, reports heavy periods, breast tenderness, and irritability. Her Dutch Test shows high 16α-OHE1 levels and low 2-OH levels. Which nutritional intervention is most targeted for improving her estrogen metabolite ratio?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of saturated fats to boost cholesterol.",
                "Supplementing with DIM (Diindolylmethane) or Sulforaphane to support the CYP1A1 pathway.",
                "Reducing fiber intake to slow down estrogen excretion.",
                "Avoiding cruciferous vegetables to protect thyroid function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DIM and Sulforaphane (found in cruciferous vegetables) promote the Phase I hydroxylation of estrogen toward the 'protective' 2-OH pathway and away from the 'pro-proliferative' 16-OH pathway."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Case Study: James, 45, experiences a '3 AM wake-up' characterized by a racing heart and anxiety. A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) shows his blood sugar dropping to 62 mg/dL shortly before waking. What is the most likely physiological explanation?",
            "options": [
                "Nocturnal hypoglycemia triggering a compensatory surge of cortisol and adrenaline.",
                "A normal surge in growth hormone that causes anxiety.",
                "The 'Dawn Phenomenon' occurring earlier than usual.",
                "Excessive melatonin production causing a drop in blood pressure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When blood glucose drops too low during sleep (nocturnal hypoglycemia), the body initiates a stress response (releasing cortisol and epinephrine) to trigger gluconeogenesis. This surge often wakes the person in a state of 'fight or flight'."
