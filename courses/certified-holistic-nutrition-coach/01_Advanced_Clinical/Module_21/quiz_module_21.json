            "question": "In the 'Architecture of a Holistic Treatment Plan,' what is the primary objective of the 'Foundational Phase' (Phase 1)?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive detoxification and heavy metal chelation",
                "Establishing homeostatic baselines through sleep, hydration, and circadian rhythm alignment",
                "High-dose supplementation to quickly reverse clinical deficiencies",
                "Transitioning the client into a long-term therapeutic ketogenic state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Foundational Phase focuses on the 'lowest hanging fruit'—lifestyle factors like sleep and hydration—to stabilize the client's physiology before introducing more complex dietary or supplemental interventions."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Hierarchy of Healing' (Clinical Prioritization), why is gastrointestinal function addressed before hormonal balancing?",
            "options": [
                "Hormones are not affected by nutrition",
                "Gut health is easier to track than hormone levels",
                "Nutrient absorption and toxicant elimination are prerequisites for endocrine system recovery",
                "Most clients prefer digestive support over hormonal support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the gut is compromised, the client cannot absorb the nutrients required for hormone synthesis (like cholesterol or amino acids), and poor elimination can lead to the recirculation of hormones like estrogen."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When performing 'Precision Macro Titration' for a client with metabolic syndrome, what is the recommended initial adjustment to carbohydrate intake to avoid 'metabolic shock'?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate reduction to 20g of net carbs per day",
                "A 15-20% reduction from the current baseline intake every 7-14 days",
                "Replacing all carbohydrates with MCT oil for the first 48 hours",
                "Increasing carbohydrates to stimulate insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A gradual titration (15-20% reduction) allows the body to upregulate the enzymes necessary for fat oxidation without triggering a significant cortisol response or 'keto flu' symptoms."

                "B12 and Folate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, while Vitamin K2 activates proteins (like osteocalcin) that direct that calcium into the bones and away from the arteries."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "During the 'Reintroduction Phase' of an elimination diet, what is the evidence-based protocol for testing a new food group?",
            "options": [
                "Introduce three new foods at once to speed up the process",
                "Consume the food 2-3 times in one day, then observe symptoms for 72 hours",
                "Eat the food only once and wait 10 days before the next test",
                "The reintroduction phase is unnecessary if the elimination phase was successful"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 72-hour window is required to monitor for delayed IgG-mediated sensitivities or changes in bowel habits, energy, and skin that may not appear immediately."

            "id": "q21_6",

                "Cognitive Reframing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (e.g., 'If I am at a restaurant, then I will order a side of greens instead of fries') reduce the 'decision fatigue' that often leads to non-adherence."

                "Improved cardiovascular fitness",
                "The client is entering a state of parasympathetic dominance",
                "Excessive physiological or psychological stress (Sympathetic dominance)",
                "The need for more dietary carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation between heartbeats; a lower HRV indicates the nervous system is under stress and the body is less resilient to the current intervention."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A client's blood work shows a Fasting Insulin of 25 uIU/mL (Standard Range: <10 uIU/mL). Based on Module 21's titration strategies, what is the priority?",
            "options": [
                "Refer to a physician for suspected insulin resistance while implementing a low-glycemic load plan",
                "Ignore the result as it is likely a laboratory error",
                "Increase fruit intake to provide natural sugars for energy",
                "Recommend a 7-day water fast to reset insulin receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A fasting insulin of 25 is a clinical marker of significant insulin resistance. The coach must refer for medical oversight while providing nutritional support to manage glycemic load."

                "The time of day when a client is most likely to take supplements",
                "The range between the minimum effective dose and the dose that causes adverse effects",
                "The 30-minute period following a workout for protein consumption",
                "The duration of a client's initial consultation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapeutic window ensures the intervention is potent enough to elicit a change without causing toxicity or 'healing crises' that lead to client drop-out."

            "explanation": "Adjusting, prescribing, or removing pharmaceutical medication is strictly outside the scope of practice for a nutrition coach and constitutes practicing medicine without a license."
