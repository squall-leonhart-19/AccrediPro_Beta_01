            "question": "In the Hierarchy of Evidence, which study design is positioned directly below a Systematic Review but above a Cohort Study?",
            "options": [
                "Case-Control Study",
                "Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)",
                "Expert Opinion",
                "Cross-Sectional Survey"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the 'gold standard' for individual primary studies and sit just below meta-analyses and systematic reviews in the hierarchy of evidence."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A study finds that a specific phytonutrient reduces blood pressure by 2 mmHg with a p-value of 0.01. How should a coach interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "The result is statistically significant but may lack clinical relevance.",
                "The result is not statistically significant because the reduction is too small.",
                "The result proves the phytonutrient is a primary cure for hypertension.",
                "The p-value indicates that the result occurred by chance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Statistical significance (p < 0.05) means the result is unlikely due to chance, but clinical relevance (effect size) determines if the change is meaningful for the client's health. A 2 mmHg drop is minor despite the low p-value."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "When interpreting a Forest Plot in a meta-analysis, what does the 'diamond' at the bottom of the plot represent?",
            "options": [
                "The result of the single largest study in the group.",
                "The outlier study that should be ignored.",
                "The pooled effect size and its confidence interval.",
                "The degree of industry bias across all included studies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The diamond represents the cumulative or 'pooled' result of all studies combined; its width represents the overall 95% confidence interval."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In biomarker research, why is hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) preferred over standard CRP for nutritional assessment?",
            "options": [
                "It only measures inflammation in the gut.",
                "It can detect low-grade systemic inflammation (0.5–10 mg/L) associated with chronic disease risk.",
                "It is less expensive and requires no fasting.",
                "Standard CRP only reacts to viral infections, while hs-CRP reacts to sugar."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is sensitive enough to detect the chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, whereas standard CRP is used for acute infections."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "According to research on industry bias, what is the 'Funding Effect' observed in nutritional science?",
            "options": [
                "Studies funded by industry are 4 to 8 times more likely to yield results favorable to the sponsor.",
                "Government-funded studies are generally less accurate than private studies.",
                "Industry-funded studies are always fraudulent and should be discarded.",
                "Bias only occurs when the researchers are also the owners of the company."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Funding Effect' describes the statistical trend where industry-sponsored research consistently produces outcomes that benefit the sponsor's commercial interests, often through selective reporting or study design."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A client has a confirmed MTHFR 677C→T polymorphism. Based on nutrigenomics evidence, what is the most appropriate evidence-based recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Avoid all forms of leafy greens.",
                "Supplement with high doses of synthetic folic acid.",
                "Prioritize methylfolate (5-MTHF) and riboflavin to support the methylation cycle.",
                "Switch to a high-protein, zero-carbohydrate diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nutrigenomics research shows that those with the MTHFR 677T allele have reduced enzyme efficiency; methylfolate and riboflavin (a cofactor) help bypass this genetic bottleneck."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Clinical evidence regarding the Gut-Brain-Immune axis suggests that what percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 90-95%",
                "Serotonin is only produced in the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Up to 95% of the body's serotonin is produced by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, highlighting the profound impact of microbiome health on mood and neurotransmitter balance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Translational nutrition is the 'bench-to-bedside' (or lab-to-plate) application, ensuring that complex scientific findings are converted into sustainable lifestyle changes."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "If a meta-analysis reports an I² statistic of 85%, how should the coach interpret the 'Heterogeneity' of the data?",
            "options": [
                "The studies are very similar and the conclusion is highly reliable.",
                "There is high variability between studies, meaning the intervention may work differently for different people.",
                "The data is 85% accurate and 15% inaccurate.",
                "The researchers used 85 different types of software to analyze the data."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An I² value above 75% indicates high heterogeneity, meaning the results of the included studies varied significantly. This suggests the effect of the intervention is inconsistent across different populations or conditions."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue. Biomarker research indicates high Ferritin but high hs-CRP. What is the most likely evidence-based interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client has iron-overload disease (Hemochromatosis).",
                "The client is iron deficient and needs immediate supplementation.",
                "The Ferritin is 'falsely' elevated due to systemic inflammation (an acute-phase reactant).",
                "The client is consuming too much Vitamin C."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant. When hs-CRP is high, Ferritin levels rise due to inflammation, which can mask an underlying iron deficiency or simply reflect the inflammatory state rather than true iron stores."
