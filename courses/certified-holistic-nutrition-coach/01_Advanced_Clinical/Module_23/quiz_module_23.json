            "question": "A client presents with the MTHFR C677T homozygous polymorphism. According to clinical nutrigenomics, what is the estimated reduction in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme activity compared to the wild-type genotype?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 70-75%",
                "Approximately 95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with the MTHFR C677T homozygous (TT) genotype typically experience a 70-75% reduction in enzyme efficiency, significantly impacting their ability to convert 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)."

            "question": "In the context of Metabolic Flexibility, a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.70 during a fasted state indicates which of the following metabolic conditions?",
            "options": [
                "Pure carbohydrate oxidation",
                "Pure fatty acid oxidation",

                "Severe metabolic ketoacidosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Respiratory Quotient (RQ) is the ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed. An RQ of 0.70 signifies that the body is primarily utilizing fatty acids for fuel, which is a hallmark of high metabolic flexibility during fasting."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Advanced Gut-Brain Axis interventions often focus on Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Which SCFA has been clinically shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and upregulate the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, which promotes the expression of BDNF, supporting neuroplasticity and cognitive function via the gut-brain-axis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 2015 study (Roenneberg et al.) found that for every hour of social jetlag (the difference between sleep midpoints on work vs. free days), the risk of being obese increases by roughly 33%."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "During Phase II Biotransformation, which conjugation pathway is most critical for the detoxification of heavy metals and lipid peroxides, requiring the tripeptide Glutathione?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutathione conjugation (catalyzed by GST enzymes) is the primary pathway for neutralizing electrophilic toxins, including heavy metals like mercury and lead, and metabolic byproducts like lipid peroxides."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In the TAO (Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian) Axis, how does chronically elevated cortisol (Hypercortisolemia) directly affect thyroid hormone peripheral conversion?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the 5'-deiodinase enzyme to increase T3",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, increasing Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "It increases Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) production",
                "It has no direct effect on thyroid conversion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3. This leads to increased production of Reverse T3 (rT3), an inactive isomer that competes for receptor sites."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Longevity science identifies mTOR and AMPK as opposing nutrient-sensing pathways. Which of the following nutritional interventions would most effectively ACTIVATE the AMPK pathway while INHIBITING mTOR?",
            "options": [
                "High-protein diet rich in Leucine",
                "Post-workout carbohydrate loading",

                "Frequent small meals (6 times per day)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMPK is activated by a high AMP:ATP ratio (low energy status), which occurs during fasting or caloric restriction. This activation simultaneously inhibits mTOR, the master regulator of protein synthesis and cellular growth, thereby triggering autophagy."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), chronic activation of the HPA axis can lead to 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Resistance.' What is the clinical result of this phenomenon?",

                "Excessive suppression of the immune system",
                "Unchecked systemic inflammation due to immune cells' inability to respond to cortisol",
                "Rapid weight loss and muscle wasting",
                "Increased sensitivity to sedative medications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) Resistance occurs when immune cells downregulate their receptors in response to chronic cortisol. Because cortisol can no longer 'turn off' the inflammatory response, the result is chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A client transitioning to a Therapeutic Ketosis protocol experiences the 'Keto Flu' (headaches, fatigue, and cramping) on day 4. What is the primary physiological mechanism driving these symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Glucotoxicity from remaining blood sugar",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As insulin levels drop during the transition to ketosis, the kidneys excrete sodium and water at an accelerated rate (natriuresis). This electrolyte imbalance is the primary cause of 'Keto Flu' symptoms."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "Which 'Senolytic' compound found in strawberries and apples has been studied for its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fisetin is a potent flavonoid and senolytic that has been shown in research (e.g., Yousefzadeh et al., 2018) to reduce senescent cell burden and extend healthspan by targeting pro-survival pathways in aging cells."
