            "question": "In Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis (FBCA), how does a 'Functional Range' differ from a 'Pathological Range' used by standard laboratories?",
            "options": [
                "Functional ranges are wider to include more of the population.",
                "Functional ranges represent the mean average of all sick patients visiting the lab.",
                "Functional ranges are tighter, evidence-based intervals designed to identify physiological dysfunction before disease onset.",
                "Functional ranges are only applicable to athletes and do not apply to the general population."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges are narrower than pathological ranges; they aim to identify 'sub-clinical' trends where a patient may be symptomatic despite being 'within normal limits' on a standard lab report."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client's Advanced GI Mapping shows a significantly low level of Pancreatic Elastase-1 (<200 ug/g). What is the most likely clinical implication?",
            "options": [
                "Acute bacterial infection in the small intestine.",
                "Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI) requiring digestive enzyme support.",
                "High diversity of the commensal microbiome.",
                "Increased intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pancreatic Elastase-1 is a highly specific marker for exocrine pancreatic function. Levels below 200 ug/g indicate insufficiency, often leading to malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "On an Organic Acids Test (OAT), an elevation in Arabinose is most commonly associated with which of the following conditions?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12 deficiency.",
                "Mitochondrial dysfunction in the Krebs cycle.",
                "Candida albicans (yeast) overgrowth in the intestinal tract.",
                "Excessive protein consumption and ammonia buildup."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arabinose is a sugar alcohol produced by the overgrowth of Candida species. High levels on an OAT often correlate with symptoms of brain fog and sugar cravings."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "The DUTCH test (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) measures the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Why is the CAR considered a vital marker of HPA-axis health?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the total volume of cortisol produced in 24 hours.",
                "It reflects the 'stress resilience' and the ability of the HPA-axis to recruit energy upon waking.",
                "It determines if the client has a genetic mutation in the CYP1B1 gene.",
                "It is the only way to measure thyroid hormone conversion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a 35-50% rise in cortisol levels within 30 minutes of waking. It serves as a 'mini stress test' for the HPA-axis, reflecting the hippocampus's ability to regulate the stress response."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Why is intracellular micronutrient analysis (e.g., in white blood cells) often preferred over serum testing for minerals like Magnesium?",
            "options": [
                "Serum levels are tightly regulated by the body and stay 'normal' even when cellular stores are depleted.",
                "Serum testing is more expensive and less accessible.",
                "Intracellular testing only reflects the last 24 hours of intake.",
                "White blood cells do not contain minerals, making them a 'blank slate' for testing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Only about 1% of total body magnesium is found in the blood serum. The body will pull minerals from cells and bone to maintain serum homeostasis, meaning a serum test often misses a functional deficiency."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In immunological assessment, which immunoglobulin is responsible for 'Type III' delayed food sensitivities that can manifest up to 72 hours after ingestion?",
            "options": [
                "IgE",
                "IgA",
                "IgG",
                "IgM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IgG antibodies mediate delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Unlike IgE (immediate/anaphylactic), IgG reactions are cumulative and can take 24-72 hours to manifest, making them difficult to identify without testing."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client possesses a 'Slow' COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) genetic SNP. Which nutritional intervention is most appropriate to support their estrogen and neurotransmitter metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "High doses of caffeine to stimulate enzyme activity.",
                "Increasing magnesium and supporting methylation to assist in the breakdown of catecholamines and estrogens.",
                "Strict avoidance of all dietary fats.",
                "Supplementing with high-dose synthetic Folic Acid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme requires magnesium and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as cofactors. Individuals with 'slow' COMT may struggle to clear dopamine and estrogen, leading to increased anxiety and estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA), what does a 'Calcium Shell' (calcium levels > 200 mg%) typically represent clinically?",
            "options": [
                "Excellent bone density and calcium absorption.",
                "A state of chronic stress where calcium is moving out of the bones and into the soft tissues, often causing 'numbness' or emotional withdrawal.",
                "Acute heavy metal poisoning from Lead.",
                "A deficiency in Vitamin D3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Calcium Shell' on an HTMA indicates that calcium is biounavailable and depositing in soft tissues. This is often a defense mechanism during chronic burnout or trauma, leading to a 'hardened' emotional state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the 'Optimal' functional range for Fasting Glucose, and how does it compare to the standard clinical 'Pre-diabetes' threshold?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal: 90-110 mg/dL; Pre-diabetes: >126 mg/dL",
                "Optimal: 75-86 mg/dL; Pre-diabetes: >100 mg/dL",
                "Optimal: 60-70 mg/dL; Pre-diabetes: >90 mg/dL",
                "Optimal: 100-120 mg/dL; Pre-diabetes: >140 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine identifies 75-86 mg/dL as the optimal range for fasting glucose. Standard labs often do not flag blood sugar as an issue until it exceeds 100 mg/dL (pre-diabetes threshold)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which marker on a DUTCH test would indicate that a client is preferentially metabolizing estrogen down the potentially 'genotoxic' 16-OH pathway rather than the 'protective' 2-OH pathway?",
            "options": [
                "High 2-Hydroxyestrone",
                "Low 4-Hydroxyestrone",
                "High 16-alpha-Hydroxyestrone",
                "High Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "16-OH estrone is highly proliferative and linked to increased risks of estrogen-sensitive tissues. The 2-OH pathway is considered the 'safer' or 'cleaner' metabolic route for estrogen."
