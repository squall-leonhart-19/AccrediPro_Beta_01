            "question": "In the case of PCOS and Metabolic Resistance, which specific ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol has been shown in clinical trials to best restore regular ovulation and improve insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "10:1",
                "40:1",
                "100:1",
                "1:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research, including a 2019 meta-analysis, confirms that the physiological ratio of 40:1 (Myo:D-chiro) is the most effective for treating PCOS symptoms and metabolic dysregulation compared to other ratios."

            "question": "When addressing the Gut-Brain Axis in clients with chronic IBS and Anxiety, what percentage of the body's total serotonin is estimated to be produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 75%",
                "Approximately 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Roughly 95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut. While this serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, it significantly influences the vagus nerve and systemic signaling that affects mood and motility."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 regarding Hashimoto’s, why is the introduction of high-dose iodine contraindicated before ensuring adequate selenium levels?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine competes with selenium for absorption in the small intestine.",
                "Selenium is required to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide produced during iodine's conversion by Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO).",
                "High iodine levels trigger immediate excretion of T3 and T4.",
                "Selenium converts iodine into its radioactive isotope within the follicular cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The oxidation of iodide by TPO generates hydrogen peroxide. Selenium-dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidases) are required to neutralize this; without selenium, the peroxide can damage the thyroid gland and exacerbate the autoimmune response."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (HPA Axis Dysregulation) concept, chronic stress leads to Estrogen Dominance primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol directly stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen.",
                "The body prioritizes cortisol production, depleting the precursor pool for progesterone, leading to a relative hormonal imbalance.",
                "Adrenal fatigue causes the liver to stop detoxifying estrogen.",
                "High cortisol levels increase the sensitivity of estrogen receptors in breast tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the HPA axis is chronically activated, the precursor pregnenolone is diverted toward cortisol production at the expense of progesterone. This results in a low progesterone-to-estrogen ratio, commonly termed 'estrogen dominance'."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Nutrition and Cognitive Decline, which biomarker is considered a critical 'triage' indicator for B-vitamin status and neurodegeneration risk when levels exceed 10-12 μmol/L?",
            "options": [
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",

                "Fasting Insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated homocysteine is a potent neurotoxin and a marker of impaired methylation. Levels above 10-12 μmol/L are associated with increased brain atrophy rates and are often corrected with B6, B12, and Folate."

                "10 grams minimum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Threshold' is generally cited as 2.5 to 3.0 grams of Leucine per meal. This amount is necessary to trigger the mTOR pathway, which is essential for recovery and muscle tissue repair."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Allergic March' describes the typical progression of atopic diseases in children, starting with skin barrier dysfunction (eczema) and often progressing to food allergies, then respiratory issues like asthma and allergic rhinitis."

                "2.5 g/kg body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the RDA is 0.8 g/kg, geriatric research suggests that 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg is necessary to overcome 'anabolic resistance' and maintain muscle mass in the elderly."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with Hashimoto's, bloating, and brain fog. Her labs show high TPO antibodies and low Ferritin (15 ng/mL). What is the most likely physiological connection?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormones are required for the absorption of dietary iron.",
                "Low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria), common in autoimmune thyroiditis, impairs iron absorption and contributes to SIBO/bloating.",
                "Iron supplements cause an increase in TPO antibodies.",
                "Hashimoto's causes the kidneys to excrete iron too rapidly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "There is a strong correlation between Hashimoto's and low stomach acid. Hypochlorhydria prevents the proper breakdown of protein and the ionization of minerals like iron, leading to deficiency and digestive distress."
