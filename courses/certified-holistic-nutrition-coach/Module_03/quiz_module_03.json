            "question": "According to the AccrediPro philosophy of Root Cause Analysis, what is the primary distinction between 'Functional' and 'Conventional' medicine?",
            "options": [
                "Conventional medicine ignores nutrition entirely, while functional medicine only uses supplements.",
                "Functional medicine focuses on identifying the 'why' behind symptoms, whereas conventional medicine often focuses on acute symptom suppression.",
                "Functional medicine is only for chronic illness, while conventional medicine is only for emergencies.",
                "There is no distinction; both models use the same diagnostic reference ranges for all biomarkers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine seeks the underlying biological drivers (the 'why'), while the conventional model is primarily designed for acute care and managing symptoms through pharmacology."

            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score of 2.4. Based on the data in Lesson 2, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal insulin sensitivity; no intervention needed.",
                "Early-stage insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.",
                "Type 1 Diabetes requiring immediate insulin therapy.",
                "Severe clinical hypoglycemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs may ignore it, a HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early-stage insulin resistance, even if fasting glucose remains within the 'normal' range."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which of the following best defines a 'Subclinical Micronutrient Deficiency' as discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "A total absence of a nutrient leading to immediate death.",
                "A deficiency that causes classic diseases like Scurvy or Beriberi.",
                "Nutrient levels that are sufficient to prevent acute disease but insufficient to support optimal cellular function.",
                "A condition that can only be diagnosed through genetic testing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Subclinical deficiencies occur when nutrient levels are above the 'scurvy' line but below the 'optimal' line, leading to chronic fatigue, poor immunity, and low metabolic rate."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is identified as a key marker for systemic inflammation. A meta-analysis cited in the lesson links an hs-CRP level above 3.0 mg/L to which outcome?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% decrease in metabolic syndrome risk.",
                "High cardiovascular risk and increased systemic cytokine activity.",
                "Improved cognitive function and neural plasticity.",
                "Optimal recovery from resistance training."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP > 3.0 mg/L is a validated marker for high cardiovascular risk and indicates that the body is in a state of chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like phthalates and BPA. What is the primary mechanism by which these toxins cause hormonal dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "They physically destroy the thyroid gland on contact.",
                "They act as hormone mimics, binding to receptor sites and blocking or overstimulating natural signals.",
                "They increase the rate of stomach acid production, leading to ulcers.",
                "They prevent the absorption of dietary fiber in the colon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs are dangerous because they 'mimic' natural hormones (like estrogen), binding to receptors and disrupting the delicate balance of the endocrine system."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "During the 'Resistance' stage (Stage 2) of HPA-Axis Dysfunction, what is the typical physiological response observed in a client?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Crash' phase where cortisol is extremely low throughout the entire day.",
                "A temporary spike in adrenaline followed by immediate recovery.",
                "Sustained high cortisol levels (hypercortisolemia) as the body attempts to compensate for chronic stress.",
                "The complete cessation of DHEA production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Stage 2 (Resistance), the body maintains high cortisol levels to meet the demands of chronic stress, often leading to 'wired but tired' feelings and midsection weight gain."

            "id": "q3_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IgG reactions are delayed (up to 72 hours), making them difficult to track without the Root Cause Assessment Framework, unlike IgE reactions which are immediate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This model posits that chronic illness arises from the interaction of genetic predisposition, environmental triggers (toxins/pathogens), and lifestyle choices (diet/stress)."

            "question": "Client Case Study: Mark (45) has a waist-to-hip ratio of 1.1, fasting glucose of 105 mg/dL, and reports severe afternoon energy crashes. Which 'Root Cause' should the coach investigate first?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mark's high waist-to-hip ratio and elevated fasting glucose, combined with energy crashes, are hallmark indicators of metabolic dysregulation."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Why is 'Uncovering the Root Cause' considered the most critical step in the AccrediPro methodology before moving to the 'N' (Nourish) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients will not pay for coaching unless they have a diagnosis.",
                "Because providing 'healthy' food to a body with an unaddressed root cause (like a parasite or toxin) may not resolve the symptoms.",
                "Because the coach needs to prove that the client's previous doctor was wrong.",
                "It isn't; the coach should always start with a standardized meal plan regardless of root causes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If the root cause (e.g., lead toxicity or HPA-axis collapse) isn't identified, even the 'cleanest' diet may fail to produce results because the underlying biological machinery is compromised."
