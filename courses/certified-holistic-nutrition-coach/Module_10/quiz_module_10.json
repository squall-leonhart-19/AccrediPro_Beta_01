            "question": "In the study of Nutrigenomics, what is the primary distinction between 'Nutrigenetics' and 'Nutrigenomics'?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrigenetics studies how nutrients affect gene expression, while Nutrigenomics studies how genetic variations affect nutrient response.",
                "Nutrigenetics studies how genetic variations affect nutrient response, while Nutrigenomics studies how nutrients affect gene expression.",
                "Nutrigenetics refers only to macronutrients, while Nutrigenomics refers only to micronutrients.",
                "There is no functional distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrigenetics focuses on how your DNA (SNPs) impacts your body's response to nutrients, whereas Nutrigenomics focuses on how the food you eat influences the expression of your genes (epigenetics)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with a homozygous C677T mutation (two copies) typically see a 60-70% reduction in the efficiency of the MTHFR enzyme, significantly impacting their ability to convert folate into its active 5-MTHF form."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While mild autophagy occurs earlier, significant clinical upregulation of the autophagic process in humans generally requires a fasting window of 24 to 48 hours to fully deplete glycogen and suppress insulin/mTOR."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is the concept that a small amount of stress triggers a beneficial adaptation. Sulforaphane is a pro-oxidant that triggers the Nrf2 pathway, causing the body to produce its own powerful antioxidants like glutathione."
