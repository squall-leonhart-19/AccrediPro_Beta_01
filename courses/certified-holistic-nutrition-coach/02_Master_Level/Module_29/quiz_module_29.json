            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 2 (Observation and Systemic Synthesis) is the stage where the practitioner connects the dots between different physiological systems to create a unified clinical picture."

            "question": "In Advanced Case Conceptualization, what is the primary advantage of using 'Causal Loop Diagrams' over traditional linear symptom tracking?",
            "options": [
                "They are faster to draw during a client session.",
                "They focus exclusively on caloric intake and expenditure.",
                "They identify self-reinforcing feedback loops that maintain chronic dysfunction.",
                "They provide a standardized template that fits every client regardless of history."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Causal Loop Diagrams allow practitioners to see how systems interact, such as how stress (Adrenals) might drive poor food choices (Habit), which then worsens inflammation (Gut), creating a cycle."

            "id": "q29_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 to active T3, instead shunting T4 into the inactive rT3."

            "question": "According to the Neuro-Behavioral Alchemy framework, why do identity-based habits (e.g., 'I am a person who nourishes my body') outlast outcome-based goals (e.g., 'I want to lose 10 pounds')?",
            "options": [
                "Identity-based habits require less willpower because they align with the self-concept.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sustainable habit change occurs when the behavior becomes part of the client's identity, reducing the cognitive load and 'friction' of making healthy choices."

                "Ignore the Histamine Intolerance until the SIBO is 100% resolved.",
                "Identify the 'Safe Overlap' and prioritize the least restrictive, most nutrient-dense intervention to prevent orthorexia.",
                "Switch the client to a liquid-only diet to bypass all triggers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners focus on the 'Safe Overlap' to ensure nutrient density and mental well-being, avoiding the physiological stress of extreme restriction."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 80-90% of Vagal fibers are afferent, highlighting how gut health and 'gut feelings' significantly influence brain state and emotional regulation."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "In the Master Practitioner Workflow, applying the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) means:",

            "question": "Case Study: A client has chronic bloating (Gut), fatigue (Adrenal), and thinning hair (Thyroid). If the practitioner determines the 'Triad' is driven by HPA-axis dysfunction from over-exercising, what is the most logical first step?",

                "Prescribe high-dose iodine for thyroid support.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Triad of Health, the Adrenals (HPA axis) often need to be stabilized first because the body will not prioritize 'healing' the gut or 'metabolizing' via the thyroid if it perceives a state of survival/stress."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study (referenced in Lesson 2) found a 62% reduction in drop-out rates, as clients felt more 'seen' and understood the 'why' behind their complex protocols through visual mapping."
