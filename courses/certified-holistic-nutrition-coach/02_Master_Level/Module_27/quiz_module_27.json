            "question": "A client presents with a homozygous MTHFR C677T polymorphism. According to nutri-genomic protocols, which biomarker is most critical to monitor to assess functional methylation capacity?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Iron levels",
                "Plasma Homocysteine",
                "Blood Glucose (HbA1c)",
                "Total Cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T mutation reduces the efficiency of the enzyme responsible for converting 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This impairment often leads to elevated homocysteine levels, which is a key marker for cardiovascular risk and methylation insufficiency."

            "question": "In the context of Integrative Support for Autoimmune Pathologies, what is the primary mechanism behind 'Molecular Mimicry'?",
            "options": [
                "The body's inability to digest complex carbohydrates leading to fermentation.",
                "The immune system attacking foreign proteins that share structural similarities with self-tissue.",
                "A genetic mutation that prevents the production of T-regulatory cells.",
                "The overproduction of cortisol which suppresses the entire immune response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system mounts a response against a foreign antigen (like gliadin in gluten) that structurally resembles a human protein (like thyroid tissue), leading to cross-reactive autoimmune destruction."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "To optimize Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) for cognitive performance and mental health, which nutritional intervention has shown the most significant impact in clinical meta-analyses?",

                "Low-protein vegan dieting",
                "Omega-3 fatty acid (DHA) supplementation and intermittent fasting",
                "Consistent intake of refined simple sugars"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a key protein for neuroplasticity. Research indicates that DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and metabolic stressors like intermittent fasting or caloric restriction significantly upregulate BDNF expression, supporting cognitive longevity."

                "They are primarily burning carbohydrates for fuel.",
                "They are in a state of severe metabolic acidosis.",
                "They are efficiently utilizing fatty acids as their primary fuel source.",
                "They have reached their VO2 max and are anaerobic."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 in a fasted state suggests excellent metabolic flexibility and the ability to shift to fat-burning efficiently."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline is a critical methyl donor and precursor to acetylcholine. It is essential during pregnancy and early childhood for hippocampal development; deficiencies during this window can lead to permanent changes in cognitive architecture."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "For a holistic strength athlete aiming to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS), what is the current evidence-based recommendation for daily protein intake?",
            "options": [
                "0.4 - 0.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "0.8 g/kg of body weight (RDA)",

                "4.0 - 5.0 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the RDA is 0.8 g/kg, athletes require significantly more to support repair and hypertrophy. Meta-analyses suggest a range of 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg of body weight is optimal for those engaged in resistance training."

            "options": [
                "A total absence of estrogen production.",
                "A decline in progesterone that occurs faster than the decline in estrogen.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During perimenopause, ovulation becomes irregular, leading to lower progesterone production. Even if estrogen levels are also declining, the ratio of estrogen to progesterone remains high, creating symptoms of functional estrogen dominance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulfation is a Phase II detoxification pathway that requires sulfur-containing amino acids. L-Cysteine and Methionine provide the necessary sulfur groups for the conjugation and excretion of various toxins and hormones."

                "AMPK inhibits the production of mitochondria (mitochondrial biogenesis)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AMPK acts as a metabolic master switch that senses low cellular energy. When activated (via exercise or fasting), it inhibits mTOR (growth) and promotes AMPK-mediated pathways like autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis."
