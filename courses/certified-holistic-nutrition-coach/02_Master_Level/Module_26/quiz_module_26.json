            "question": "When utilizing the Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) during the Advanced Intake Framework (L1), what score range typically indicates 'Severe' systemic toxicity or functional imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "10 - 25 points",
                "30 - 50 points",
                "60 - 90 points",
                "Over 100 points"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the MSQ scoring system used in functional nutrition, a score exceeding 100 points is a clinical indicator of severe systemic dysfunction and high toxic load, requiring a more phased and cautious detoxification approach."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In the 12-Week N.O.U.R.I.S.H. Roadmap Architecture, what does the 'U' represent in the chronological sequence of the program?",
            "options": [
                "Undergo Detoxification",
                "Uncover Triggers & Deficiencies",

                "Utilize Macro-nutrients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'U' in N.O.U.R.I.S.H. stands for 'Uncover,' which involves deeper investigation through functional testing or elimination protocols to identify specific triggers, sensitivities, or nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During Phase 1: Priming the Digestive Terrain (O & N), why is 'Optimizing' digestion prioritized before 'Nourishing' with high-density nutrients?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the financial cost of supplements for the client",
                "To ensure the client can actually break down and absorb the nutrients provided",
                "Because high-density nutrients are toxic to an unprimed liver",
                "To allow the client to finish their existing food pantry items first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bioavailability is secondary to digestive capacity. If the 'digestive fire' (HCL, enzymes, bile) is not optimized, even the highest quality nutrient-dense foods will not be properly absorbed, potentially leading to putrefaction or fermentation in the gut."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard functional medicine sequence is Remove (pathogens/triggers), Replace (digestive secretions), Reinnoculate (probiotics/prebiotics), Repair (gut lining support), and Rebalance (lifestyle/mindset)."

                "Organic Acids Test (OAT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DUTCH test provides a comprehensive look at free and metabolized cortisol, as well as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and their metabolites, which serum or saliva alone cannot capture with the same depth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Fogg Behavior Model states that Behavior (B) happens when Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P) come together at the same time."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MTHFR polymorphisms impair the body's ability to convert synthetic folic acid into its active form. These clients benefit from pre-methylated B-vitamins (5-MTHF and Methylcobalamin) to support detoxification and neurotransmitter synthesis."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "When scaling to 'Group Delivery' (L8), what is a primary clinical advantage of the 'Cohort-Based' model over the 'Evergreen' model?",
            "options": [
                "Lower overhead costs for the practitioner",
                "Increased social proof and peer-to-peer accountability",

                "The ability for clients to start at any time of the year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cohort-based models create a 'community effect' where clients move through the 12-week roadmap together, fostering social support, shared experiences, and higher completion rates through collective accountability."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (42) has an MSQ score of 115, suffers from PCOS, and has failed multiple 'clean eating' attempts. Based on the N.O.U.R.I.S.H. framework, why should you avoid starting her on a strict Phase 2 'Uncover' protocol immediately?",
            "options": [
                "Because she needs to lose weight first",
                "Because her systemic load is too high; she needs 'Priming' (Phase 1) to stabilize her system first",
                "Because PCOS is strictly genetic and cannot be helped by nutrition",
                "Because Phase 2 is only for male clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High MSQ scores (115) indicate a system under significant stress. Jumping into intensive 'uncovering' (like heavy elimination or pathogen killing) can trigger a Herxheimer reaction or further metabolic stress if the 'Priming' (Phase 1: O & N) hasn't established stable elimination and nutrient foundations."

                "Taking all supplements at once at 2:00 AM",
                "Anchoring the new habit (supplements) to an existing, automatic habit (e.g., brushing teeth)",
                "Buying a vibrating pill bottle that alarms every hour",
                "Asking the client to write 'Take Pills' 50 times in a journal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking works by using a 'neural anchor'—an existing habit that is already hardwired in the brain—and attaching the new behavior to it, significantly increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence."
