            "question": "In the Clinical Triage hierarchy for complex clients, which of the following must be addressed before initiating intensive gut protocols or detoxification?",
            "options": [
                "Micronutrient deficiencies and mineral balancing",

                "Heavy metal chelation and liver support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is the first priority. Before any nutritional intervention, the coach must ensure the client is medically stable and screen for 'red flags' (e.g., suicidal ideation, rapid unexplained weight loss, or acute cardiac symptoms) that require immediate referral."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the NOURISH framework, 'I' stands for Immune Modulation & Inflammation Control, which is critical for stabilizing clients with multi-system dysregulation before moving to deeper metabolic work."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding metabolic crisis suggests that Glycemic Variability (GV) is a stronger predictor of oxidative stress than HbA1c alone. What is the target range for 'Time in Range' (TIR) for a complex metabolic client to minimize crisis risk?",
            "options": [
                "Above 50%",
                "Above 70%",

                "Above 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines for complex metabolic cases suggest a 'Time in Range' (TIR) of >70% to significantly reduce the risk of microvascular complications and acute metabolic crisis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic LPS (endotoxins) from gut permeability can cross the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), activating the brain's innate immune cells (microglia). This 'priming' makes the brain hyper-reactive to future stressors."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In cases of Autoimmune Flares and Loss of Oral Tolerance, which cell type is the primary target for nutritional support to restore immune 'braking' functions?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Nutritional strategies (like Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and Butyrate) focus on increasing Treg function to dampen flares."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A 'Non-Responder' client has followed a strict anti-inflammatory diet and gut protocol for 6 months with zero improvement. According to Module 28, what is the most likely 'Hidden Obstacle' to investigate next?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of dietary compliance",
                "Inadequate caloric intake",

                "Insufficient protein variety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is a 'Non-Responder' despite perfect compliance, practitioners must look for 'Stealth Obstacles' such as mycotoxins, heavy metals, or chronic occult infections (CIRS) that keep the nervous system in a state of high threat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary role of a nutrition coach in oncology is supportive: managing side effects, maintaining lean muscle mass (preventing cachexia), and improving quality of life, always in coordination with the oncology team."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurological red flags like a 'thunderclap' headache or unilateral weakness suggest a potential stroke or vascular event and require immediate medical intervention."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Research on 'The Non-Responder' suggests that approximately what percentage of stalled progress in chronic fatigue cases is linked to unaddressed HPA-axis dysfunction and 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR)?",

                "Less than 5%",
                "Roughly 15%",

                "Exactly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex chronic illness, the Cell Danger Response (CDR) is a fundamental metabolic shift. Studies suggest over 60% of non-responders are stuck in a CDR cycle where the body prioritizes defense over recovery."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A client presents with Hashimoto's, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and Type 2 Diabetes. Using the 'Complexity First' rule, which action is most appropriate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In multi-system cases, you must address the most 'reactive' system first (MCAS/Histamine) to prevent flares, stabilize blood sugar to reduce inflammation, and work within a multidisciplinary team (referral)."
