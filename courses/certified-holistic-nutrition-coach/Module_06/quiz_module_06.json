            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation intentions link a situational cue (If X happens) with a specific response (Then I will do Y), which reduces the need for conscious decision-making and willpower."
