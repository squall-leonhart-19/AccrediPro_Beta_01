            "question": "According to the 'Therapeutic Order' discussed in Lesson 1, which intervention should be prioritized before introducing high-potency nutraceuticals or glandulars?",
            "options": [
                "Targeted hormone replacement therapy",
                "Establishing the foundations for health (sleep, hydration, and nutrition)",
                "Aggressive Phase II liver detoxification protocols",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Therapeutic Order dictates that we must first establish the foundations for health and remove obstacles to healing (e.g., poor sleep, nutrient deficiencies) before moving to more invasive or potent interventions."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, metabolic health is defined by glycemic control. Which postprandial glucose reading (2 hours after a meal) is considered the optimal target for metabolic flexibility in a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "Under 180 mg/dL",
                "Under 140 mg/dL",

                "Between 140 and 160 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While clinical 'normal' is often higher, optimal metabolic health and insulin sensitivity are characterized by returning to a blood glucose level under 140 mg/dL within two hours of a meal."

            "question": "When assessing HPA-Axis function in Lesson 4, a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)—where cortisol fails to rise significantly 30 minutes after waking—is most indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "Acute high-stress 'fight or flight' response",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-60% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A flat response is a clinical marker of HPA-axis dysfunction often seen in chronic fatigue and burnout."

            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights that blue light exposure (460-480nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin. By what percentage can a 2-hour exposure to bright tablets/phones suppress melatonin levels?",

                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 22%",

                "Melatonin is not affected by blue light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that 2 hours of exposure to blue-light-emitting devices before bed can suppress melatonin levels by about 50%, significantly disrupting the circadian rhythm and sleep architecture."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 6's detoxification pathways, which compound is specifically noted for its ability to induce Nrf2 and upregulate Phase II enzymes like glutathione S-transferase?",
            "options": [
                "Caffeine",
                "Sulforaphane (from cruciferous vegetables)",

                "Simple glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a potent inducer of the Nrf2 pathway, which triggers the production of Phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Based on the 'Movement as Medicine' protocol in Lesson 7, what is the impact of a 15-minute 'postprandial' (after meal) walk on blood glucose levels?",
            "options": [
                "It has no measurable effect on glucose",
                "It can reduce glucose spikes by up to 22% compared to sitting",
                "It increases cortisol and worsens glycemic control",
                "It is only effective if done at high intensity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postprandial walking utilizes 'muscle glucose uptake' via GLUT4 translocation, significantly lowering the glucose spike (up to 22%) without requiring high insulin levels."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When synthesizing a comprehensive protocol (Lesson 8), why is 'Circadian Alignment' often addressed before 'Advanced Supplementation'?",
            "options": [
                "Because supplements are more expensive",
                "Because circadian rhythms regulate the absorption and metabolism of nutrients and hormones",
                "Because clients prefer sleep advice over diet advice",
                "It shouldn't be; supplements are always the first priority"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian biology governs nearly every physiological process, including digestion, enzyme production, and hormone sensitivity. Fixing the 'clock' ensures the body can actually utilize the nutritional interventions provided."

            "question": "A client presents with high systemic inflammation (hs-CRP of 4.5 mg/L). According to the protocols in Lesson 3, which dietary change should be the primary focus?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of refined vegetable oils (corn, soy)",
                "Eliminating ultra-processed foods and increasing polyphenols (berries, leafy greens)",
                "Switching to a high-protein, zero-fiber diet",
                "Increasing sodium intake to 5,000mg per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High hs-CRP (>3.0 mg/L) indicates systemic inflammation. Ultra-processed foods and high Omega-6 oils drive this, while polyphenols and antioxidants help modulate the inflammatory response."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which phase of liver detoxification involves 'conjugation' (adding a molecule like glutathione or sulfate to a toxin) to make it water-soluble for excretion?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I (Cytochrome P450)",
                "Phase II",
                "Phase III (Antioxidant defense)",
                "Phase IV (Bacterial fermentation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification is the conjugation phase, where the liver attaches a substance (glucuronic acid, glutathione, or an amino acid) to a toxin to make it water-soluble so it can be excreted via bile or urine."
