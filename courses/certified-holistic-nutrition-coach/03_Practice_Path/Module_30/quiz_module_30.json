            "explanation": "Niche mastery establishes you as an expert in a specific area, allowing for value-based pricing and higher conversion rates (up to 73% higher than generalists) because you solve a specific, high-stakes problem for a specific group."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Automating a broken or unrefined process only 'scales the mess.' You must first prove the workflow manually (the 'Do It Manually' phase) before moving to the 'Automate' phase."
