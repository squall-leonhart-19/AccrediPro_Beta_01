                "It has no measurable effect on immune cell signaling.",
                "It causes a permanent shutdown of the HPA axis that cannot be reversed.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to sustained cortisol release, which eventually causes immune cells to downregulate their receptors, leading to runaway inflammation despite high cortisol levels."

                "It focuses exclusively on the patient's current symptoms to save time.",
                "It allows the practitioner to see the chronological relationship between life events, triggers, and the evolution of symptoms.",
                "It is used only for billing and insurance coding purposes.",
                "It replaces the need for any laboratory or diagnostic testing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Timeline organizes a patient's story chronologically, helping the practitioner identify how antecedents, triggers, and mediators have interacted over time to create the current state of health."

            "question": "Research suggests that the 'Exposome'—the sum of environmental exposures over a lifetime—is a major driver of chronic disease. Approximately what percentage of chronic disease risk is estimated to be determined by environmental/lifestyle factors rather than genetics alone?",
