            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Which protein acts as the primary physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions and is utilized in functional medicine as a serum or fecal biomarker for 'leaky gut'?",
            "options": ["Occludin", "Zonulin", "Claudin-1", "Vinculin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. Elevated levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and various autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to the North American Consensus on breath testing, what is the diagnostic threshold for a positive Hydrogen (H2) SIBO result within 90 minutes of ingesting a substrate?",
            "options": "A rise of ≥10 ppm from baseline",
            "options": ["A rise of ≥10 ppm from baseline", "A rise of ≥20 ppm from baseline", "A rise of ≥30 ppm from baseline", "A rise of ≥15 ppm from baseline"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The North American Consensus states that a rise in hydrogen of ≥20 ppm from baseline within 90 minutes is considered positive for SIBO."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "A patient's functional stool analysis reveals a Fecal Calprotectin level of 250 µg/g. What is the most appropriate clinical interpretation?",
            "options": ["Normal finding with no clinical significance", "Indication of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency", "Significant mucosal inflammation requiring further investigation for IBD", "Evidence of a Type I IgE-mediated food allergy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fecal Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils during inflammation. Levels above 200-250 µg/g are strongly suggestive of active organic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Metabolic endotoxemia is primarily driven by the translocation of which substance into systemic circulation, triggering TLR4 receptors?",
            "options": ["Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)", "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)", "Secondary Bile Acids", "D-Lactate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia refers to the 2-3 fold increase in circulating Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls, which triggers systemic low-grade inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "In the 5R Framework of GI restoration, which 'R' involves the use of hydrochloric acid (HCl), digestive enzymes, and ox bile?",
            "options": ["Remove", "Replace", "Reinnoculate", "Repair"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Replace' phase focuses on restoring digestive factors that may be deficient, such as stomach acid, pancreatic enzymes, and bile salts."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which immune cell type is the primary mediator of 'Oral Tolerance,' preventing the immune system from overreacting to dietary proteins?",
            "options": ["Th17 Cells", "Natural Killer (NK) Cells", "CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs)", "B-Lymphocytes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immunological tolerance to food antigens and commensal bacteria in the gut."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "The 'Gut-Brain Axis' communication is bi-directional. Which cranial nerve serves as the primary physical conduit for transmitting sensory information from the gut to the brain?",
            "options": ["Trigeminal Nerve (V)", "Facial Nerve (VII)", "Vagus Nerve (X)", "Hypoglossal Nerve (XII)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve provides the main physical link between the enteric nervous system (ENS) and the central nervous system (CNS)."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A client with chronic constipation and bloating shows a Methane (CH4) level of 12 ppm at the 30-minute mark on a breath test. How should this be classified?",
            "options": ["Hydrogen-dominant SIBO", "Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO)", "Normal result (below 20 ppm)", "Small Intestinal Fungal Overgrowth (SIFO)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Per the North American Consensus, methane levels ≥10 ppm at any point during the test are diagnostic for Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO), which is often associated with constipation."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, are crucial for gut health. Which of the following is NOT a primary function of butyrate?",
            "options": ["Serving as the primary fuel source for colonocytes", "Promoting the differentiation of Th17 pro-inflammatory cells", "Inducing apoptosis in colon cancer cells", "Strengthening the intestinal barrier by increasing tight junction expression"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate actually promotes the differentiation of anti-inflammatory Regulatory T cells (Tregs), not pro-inflammatory Th17 cells."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which biomarker found in functional stool testing is a surrogate marker for the 'Common Mucosal Immune System' and reflects the 'first line of defense' at the GI barrier?",
            "options": ["Steatocrit", "Secretory IgA (sIgA)", "Eosinophil Protein X (EPX)", "Beta-Glucuronidase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA (sIgA) is the primary immunoglobulin of the mucosal immune system, providing immune exclusion by preventing pathogens and toxins from adhering to the intestinal epithelium."
