            "question": "According to the advanced lipidomics framework, which marker is considered the most accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk because it measures the total number of atherogenic particles?",
            "options": [
                "LDL-C (Calculated)",
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)",
                "Triglyceride/HDL Ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ApoB is the primary structural protein found on all potentially atherogenic particles (VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp(a)). Since each particle contains exactly one molecule of ApoB, it provides a direct count of the total number of atherogenic particles, making it superior to LDL-C, which only measures the mass of cholesterol within those particles."

            "question": "A patient presents with a Fasting Insulin of 18 μIU/mL and a Fasting Glucose of 105 mg/dL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and clinical status?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR 1.8; Insulin Sensitive",
                "HOMA-IR 2.5; Early Insulin Resistance",
                "HOMA-IR 4.6; Significant Insulin Resistance",
                "HOMA-IR 8.2; Type 2 Diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR = (105 * 18) / 405 = 4.66. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 indicate significant insulin resistance and increased risk for metabolic syndrome."

            "question": "In the context of mitochondrial bioenergetics, which molecule acts as the primary electron carrier, shuttling electrons from Complex I and II to Complex III of the Electron Transport Chain?",
            "options": [
                "Cytochrome C",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)",
                "Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)",
                "Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a lipid-soluble electron carrier that moves within the inner mitochondrial membrane to transport electrons from Complexes I and II to Complex III. Cytochrome C shuttles electrons between Complexes III and IV."

            "question": "Which mechanism best describes the phenomenon of 'Metabolic Endotoxemia' discussed in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "The direct infection of the myocardium by Gram-negative bacteria",
                "The translocation of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into systemic circulation via chylomicrons following high-fat meals",
                "The overproduction of lactic acid by gut bacteria during intense exercise",
                "The accumulation of urea in the blood due to kidney dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia occurs when Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the cell walls of Gram-negative gut bacteria cross the intestinal barrier. This is often facilitated by high-saturated fat intake, as LPS can be incorporated into chylomicrons and transported into the blood, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation via TLR4 activation."

            "question": "Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a critical clinical marker for endothelial health. What is its primary physiological effect?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of Nitric Oxide (NO)",
                "It acts as a competitive inhibitor of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS)",
                "It increases the elasticity of the arterial media layer",
                "It facilitates the transport of L-arginine into the endothelial cell"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADMA is an endogenous analog of L-arginine. It competes with L-arginine for the active site of the eNOS enzyme. High levels of ADMA 'uncouple' eNOS, leading to decreased Nitric Oxide production and increased superoxide formation, which promotes endothelial dysfunction."

            "question": "The Nrf2 signaling pathway is often referred to as the 'master regulator' of the antioxidant response. Which of the following is a potent dietary activator of Nrf2?",
            "options": [
                "Refined Fructose",
                "Sulforaphane (found in cruciferous vegetables)",
                "Trans-palmitoleic acid",
                "Retinol (Vitamin A)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane, particularly from broccoli sprouts, is one of the most potent natural activators of the Nrf2 pathway. Once activated, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE), triggering the expression of phase II detox enzymes and endogenous antioxidants like glutathione."

            "question": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a highly atherogenic particle. Which statement regarding its management is correct based on current clinical guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Lp(a) levels are primarily managed through low-carb dietary interventions",
                "Lp(a) is largely genetically determined and does not respond significantly to most standard statin therapies",
                "Exercise is the most effective way to lower Lp(a) by 50% or more",
                "Lp(a) should only be measured in patients over the age of 65"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lp(a) levels are 70-90% genetically determined and remain relatively stable throughout life regardless of diet or exercise. Notably, statins may slightly increase Lp(a) levels in some patients. Management focuses on lowering overall ApoB/LDL-C risk to compensate for the high Lp(a) risk."

            "question": "During the 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR), as described by Dr. Robert Naviaux, what happens to mitochondrial function?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondria increase ATP production to facilitate tissue repair",
                "Mitochondria shift from energy production to cellular defense, reducing oxidative phosphorylation",
                "Mitochondria multiply rapidly through biogenesis to meet energy demands",
                "Mitochondria stop producing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cell Danger Response is a metabolic shift where mitochondria move away from energy production (oxidative phosphorylation) toward cellular defense. This involves stiffening the cell membrane and releasing ATP into the extracellular space as a signaling molecule, which can lead to chronic fatigue if the response persists."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course examined the impact of Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) on cardiometabolic markers. What was a primary finding regarding insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "TRF had no effect on insulin sensitivity compared to standard caloric restriction",
                "TRF (10-hour window) significantly reduced HOMA-IR and fasting insulin independent of weight loss",
                "TRF was only effective if combined with a high-carbohydrate diet",
                "TRF increased oxidative stress markers in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows that Time-Restricted Feeding (specifically early TRF) can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce HOMA-IR scores even in the absence of significant weight loss, likely due to the alignment of nutrient intake with circadian rhythms of insulin expression."

            "question": "Which specific measurement on an Advanced Lipid Panel indicates 'Pattern B' and a significantly higher risk for plaque formation?",
            "options": [
                "A preponderance of Large, Buoyant LDL particles",
                "A preponderance of Small, Dense LDL (sdLDL) particles",
                "High levels of HDL2b subfractions",
                "A low Triglyceride to HDL ratio (<1.0)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pattern B refers to a lipid profile characterized by small, dense LDL particles. These particles are more atherogenic because they easily penetrate the endothelial wall, have a higher affinity for arterial proteoglycans, and are more susceptible to oxidation than large, buoyant 'Pattern A' particles."
