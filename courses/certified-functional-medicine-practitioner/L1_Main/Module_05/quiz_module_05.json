            "question": "In the 'Calibrate' phase of the AccrediPro methodology, what is the primary risk of the 'Set and Forget' clinical mindset?",
            "options": [
                "Increased administrative overhead for the practitioner",
                "Failure to account for the dynamic nature of biological systems and homeostatic shifts",
                "Reduced profitability due to fewer follow-up appointments",
                "Excessive reliance on subjective patient data over objective labs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Set and Forget' mindset ignores the fact that as one system heals, the requirements of other systems change. Calibration ensures the protocol evolves alongside the patient's shifting biochemistry."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "When re-testing biomarkers like HbA1c or Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), what is the clinically recommended minimum interval to account for biological turnover?",
            "options": [
                "14 to 21 days",
                "30 days",
                "8 to 12 weeks",
                "6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HbA1c reflects the average glucose over the lifespan of a red blood cell (~120 days), and TSH requires 6-8 weeks to stabilize after a dosage change. Re-testing earlier often yields misleading data."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client's initial Medical Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) score was 84. After 60 days, their score is 58. According to the module, does this represent a 'clinically significant' improvement?",
            "options": [
                "No, a significant improvement requires a 50% reduction in score",
                "Yes, any reduction in MSQ score is considered clinically significant",
                "Yes, it exceeds the 30% threshold for clinically significant progress",
                "No, the score must drop below 20 to be considered successful"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, a 30% reduction in the MSQ score is generally recognized as the threshold for a clinically significant response to an intervention."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "If a patient is a 'Non-Responder' to a well-designed gut healing protocol, which 'Hidden Barrier' should be investigated first according to the Module 5 troubleshooting hierarchy?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of patient compliance with the diet",
                "Inadequate dosage of probiotics",
                "Environmental triggers such as mycotoxins or occult dental infections",
                "Genetic SNPs related to vitamin D metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a standard-of-care functional protocol fails, practitioners must look for 'upstream' barriers like mold (mycotoxins), heavy metals, or hidden infections that keep the immune system in a state of high alarm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological goal of 'Titration' when introducing potent antimicrobial or detoxifying agents?",
            "options": [
                "To saturate the cellular receptors as quickly as possible",
                "To minimize the risk of Herxheimer (die-off) reactions and assess individual tolerance",
                "To ensure the patient feels an immediate 'kick' from the supplement",
                "To reduce the total cost of the supplement protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration (starting low and increasing slowly) allows the practitioner to find the 'Minimum Effective Dose' while avoiding overwhelming the patient's elimination pathways."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Clinical Pivot' framework, after how many weeks of zero objective or subjective progress should a practitioner consider a fundamental change in strategy?",
            "options": [
                "2 weeks",
                "4 weeks",
                "8 to 12 weeks",
                "24 weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 8-12 week window (roughly 90 days) is the standard 'pivot point.' If no progress is made in this timeframe, the underlying 'Root Cause' hypothesis is likely incorrect or incomplete."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "When using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a biofeedback tool for calibration, a consistent downward trend in HRV despite improved sleep suggests:",
            "options": [
                "The patient is successfully adapting to stress",
                "The patient is in a state of sympathetic dominance or overreaching",
                "The patient needs more cardiovascular exercise",
                "The HRV monitor is likely malfunctioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A declining HRV trend indicates a stressed nervous system and a lack of autonomic resilience, signaling that the current 'therapeutic load' or lifestyle stress is too high."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, transitioning to 'Longevity' involves moving the client from a 'Repair' focus to a 'Resilience' focus. What characterizes this transition?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the number of supplements to prevent future disease",
                "Widening the dietary variety and testing metabolic flexibility",
                "Restricting calories to under 1,200 per day indefinitely",
                "Stopping all testing and monitoring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longevity calibration focuses on metabolic flexibility (the ability to use different fuel sources) and expanding the diet while maintaining the gains achieved during the repair phase."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with 'hypersensitivity' to almost all supplements. What is the recommended 'Calibration' strategy for this case?",
            "options": [
                "Stop all supplements and focus exclusively on high-intensity exercise",
                "Introduce one single variable at a time, with a 3–5 day 'wash-in' period between changes",
                "Prescribe a broad-spectrum multivitamin to cover all bases at once",
                "Use the highest possible dose immediately to 'break through' the sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For sensitive 'canary' clients, the 'Rule of One' is essential: change only one variable at a time and wait several days to observe the reaction before adding anything else."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'PROMs' (Patient-Reported Outcome Measure) rather than a clinical biomarker?",
            "options": [
                "Fasting Insulin levels",
                "High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score",
                "Urinary Organic Acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PROMs are validated questionnaires (like the BPI or MSQ) that capture the patient's subjective experience of their health status, which is a critical component of the Calibration process."
