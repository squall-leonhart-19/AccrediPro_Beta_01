            "question": "A patient presents with a fasting blood glucose of 96 mg/dL. While the laboratory reference range classifies this as 'Normal' (<100 mg/dL), what is the functional medicine 'optimal' range for fasting glucose to minimize glycation risk?",
            "options": [
                "75 - 86 mg/dL",
                "90 - 99 mg/dL",
                "60 - 70 mg/dL",
                "100 - 110 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, the optimal range for fasting glucose is typically 75-86 mg/dL. Research indicates that cardiovascular and metabolic risk begins to increase once fasting glucose exceeds 87-90 mg/dL, even if it remains within the standard laboratory 'normal' range."

            "question": "When calculating the HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance), which two biomarkers are required, and what score typically indicates early insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c and Triglycerides; Score > 1.0",
                "Fasting Insulin and Fasting Glucose; Score > 1.9",
                "C-Peptide and Post-prandial Glucose; Score > 3.0",
                "Fasting Insulin and LDL-C; Score > 2.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is calculated using (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose) / 405 (for mg/dL). An optimal score is <1.0; a score >1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and >2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance."

            "question": "On a CBC with Differential, a patient shows a Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) of 3.8. Based on the functional paradigm, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Normal immune balance",
                "Acute viral infection",

                "Potential iron deficiency anemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation. While the standard range is broad, an optimal NLR is typically between 1.2 and 2.0. A ratio above 3.0 is associated with increased systemic inflammation and higher cardiovascular risk."

            "question": "A 45-year-old male has an LDL-C of 110 mg/dL but an Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) of 125 mg/dL. Which statement best describes his cardiovascular risk?",
            "options": [
                "Low risk because LDL-C is near the optimal range.",
                "High risk because ApoB indicates a high number of atherogenic particles, regardless of LDL-C mass.",
                "Average risk because his HDL-C must be high to compensate.",
                "No risk because ApoB is only relevant if Triglycerides are over 200 mg/dL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles (LDL, VLDL, IDL). A high ApoB in the presence of 'normal' LDL-C indicates a high concentration of small, dense LDL particles, which are more prone to oxidation and arterial wall penetration."

            "question": "In a patient with 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' or chronic physiological stress, which thyroid pattern is most likely to be observed on a functional panel?",
            "options": [
                "High TSH, Low Free T4, Low Free T3",
                "Low TSH, High Free T4, High Free T3",
                "Normal TSH, Normal/Low Free T4, Low Free T3, and High Reverse T3",
                "Normal TSH, High Free T4, Low Reverse T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During chronic stress or non-thyroidal illness, the body downregulates the conversion of T4 to T3 and increases the production of Reverse T3 (RT3) to conserve energy. This results in 'cellular hypothyroidism' despite a seemingly normal TSH."

            "question": "A Comprehensive Stool Analysis reveals a Fecal Elastase level of 120 μg/g. What is the primary clinical intervention indicated by this biomarker?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive antibiotic therapy for SIBO",
                "High-dose probiotics to restore Bifidobacterium",
                "Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and digestive support",
                "Increased dietary fiber to treat constipation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fecal Elastase is a marker of exocrine pancreatic function. Levels below 200 μg/g indicate pancreatic insufficiency, necessitating the use of supplemental digestive enzymes to ensure nutrient absorption."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Why is RBC Magnesium considered a more accurate clinical marker of status than Serum Magnesium?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Magnesium only represents 1% of total body magnesium and is tightly homeostatically regulated.",
                "RBC Magnesium measures the magnesium bound to hemoglobin.",
                "Serum Magnesium is affected by recent dietary intake, whereas RBC Magnesium is not.",
                "RBC Magnesium is only useful for detecting acute toxicity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Because the body maintains serum magnesium levels within a very narrow range to protect cardiac function, serum levels can appear normal even when intracellular stores are significantly depleted. RBC Magnesium reflects the status within the cells over the preceding 3-4 months."

            "question": "An elevated level of Beta-glucuronidase in a stool microbiome assessment suggests which of the following metabolic concerns?",
            "options": [
                "Inability to digest dietary proteins",
                "Increased risk of reabsorbing deconjugated toxins and estrogens from the gut",
                "A lack of beneficial Lactobacillus species",
                "Excessive production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-couples' toxins and hormones (like estrogen) that the liver has already neutralized. This allows them to be reabsorbed into circulation (enterohepatic circulation), increasing the toxic load."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is often used to assess liver health. In functional medicine, a GGT level at the very low end of the reference range (e.g., <10 U/L) may indicate:",
            "options": [
                "Superior liver detoxification capacity",
                "A deficiency in Vitamin B12",
                "Glutathione depletion or a need for sulfur-containing amino acids",
                "Optimal antioxidant status"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While high GGT indicates biliary stasis or oxidative stress, a very low GGT (below 10-15 U/L) can suggest a deficiency in the precursors needed to synthesize glutathione, as GGT is involved in the gamma-glutamyl cycle."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which biomarker ratio is the strongest predictor of insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles (Pattern B)?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol / HDL ratio",
                "LDL / HDL ratio",
                "Triglyceride / HDL ratio",
                "Albumin / Globulin ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio is a powerful surrogate marker. A ratio >2.0 (in mg/dL) suggests the presence of small dense LDL, and a ratio >3.0 is highly correlated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome."
