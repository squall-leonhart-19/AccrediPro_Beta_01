            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A Glycemic Load (GL) of 20 or more is considered high; 11-19 is medium, and 10 or less is low. High GL diets are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and systemic inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ubiquinol is the reduced, active antioxidant form of CoQ10. As patients age, their ability to convert Ubiquinone to Ubiquinol decreases, making the reduced form more effective for restoring biological function."
