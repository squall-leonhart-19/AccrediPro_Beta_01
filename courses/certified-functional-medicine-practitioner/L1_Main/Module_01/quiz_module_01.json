            "options": [
                "To initiate intensive detoxification protocols based on initial symptoms",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A trigger is a discrete event (insult) that initiates a change in health status or the onset of symptoms. Antecedents are pre-existing factors, and mediators are factors that sustain the condition."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mediators are ongoing factors—biochemical (like cytokines) or psychosocial (like chronic stress)—that contribute to the persistence of a disease process."

                "It allows the practitioner to dominate the conversation to save time",
                "It shifts the focus from the patient's story to purely objective lab data",
                "It fosters a therapeutic partnership that improves patient compliance and clinical outcomes",
                "It is a mandatory legal requirement for insurance billing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic presence and active listening are essential for building the 'Therapeutic Partnership,' which is a cornerstone of Functional Medicine and correlates with better patient engagement."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics teaches that while genes (SNPs) may load the gun, the environment (the exposome) pulls the trigger. Gene expression is highly modifiable through lifestyle and environmental interventions."

            "options": [
                "Because joint pain is always caused by lack of calcium",
                "Because systemic inflammation often originates from gut-derived triggers and dysbiosis",
                "Because the Assimilation node is the easiest to explain to patients",
                "Because insurance only covers gastrointestinal diagnostic codes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Functional Medicine, we 'start with the gut' because issues in the Assimilation node (like dysbiosis or hyperpermeability) often drive systemic inflammation that manifests in other nodes, such as Defense and Repair (joint pain)."
