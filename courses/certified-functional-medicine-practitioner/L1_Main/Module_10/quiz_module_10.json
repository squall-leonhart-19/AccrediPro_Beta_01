            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the context of Functional Architecture, which immune component is responsible for 'immune exclusion' by binding to pathogens and preventing their attachment to the mucosal epithelium?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "Secretory IgA (sIgA)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA (sIgA) is the primary antibody of the mucosal immune system. It performs immune exclusion by coating pathogens and food antigens, preventing them from adhering to and penetrating the intestinal barrier."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis highlighted the role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Which SCFA is specifically recognized as the primary energy source for colonocytes and a key regulator of T-regulatory (Treg) cell differentiation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike hydrogen SIBO which requires a rise within 90 minutes, IMO is diagnosed by a methane concentration of ≥ 10 ppm at any point during the breath test, reflecting overgrowth in both the small and large intestines."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxin) from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria binds to Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering a pro-inflammatory cascade involving NF-κB and the release of systemic inflammatory cytokines."
