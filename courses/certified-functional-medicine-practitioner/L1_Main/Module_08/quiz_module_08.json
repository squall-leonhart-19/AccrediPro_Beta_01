            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "Which biomarker is now considered the most accurate indicator of the total number of atherogenic particles, proving more predictive of cardiovascular risk than standard LDL-C?",
            "options": ["LDL-C", "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)", "HDL-C", "VLDL-Cholesterol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles (LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a)), whereas LDL-C only measures the mass of cholesterol within those particles, which can be misleading in cases of small dense LDL."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In the context of mitochondrial dysfunction, which complex of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) is the primary site of electron leakage and is most susceptible to inhibition by environmental toxins like rotenone?",
            "options": ["Complex I", "Complex II", "Complex III", "Complex IV"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest complex and a major source of superoxide production when inhibited or dysfunctional."
        },

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with resistant weight gain despite a caloric deficit. Laboratory results show elevated urinary phthalate metabolites. Which mechanism explains how these 'obesogens' contribute to adipogenesis?",
            "options": ["Direct inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis", "Activation of PPAR-gamma (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma)", "Blockage of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus", "Stimulation of ghrelin production in the stomach"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many endocrine disruptors like phthalates and organotins act as PPAR-gamma agonists, which triggers the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes (fat cells)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "According to the 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module, what is the optimal HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score for maintaining peak metabolic health and longevity?",
            "options": ["< 1.0", "< 2.5", "< 3.0", "< 5.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges often go up to 2.5, optimal functional medicine targets for HOMA-IR are < 1.0 to ensure maximum insulin sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical has been clinically shown to upregulate the expression of the LDL receptor (LDLR) on the liver surface via the activation of AMPK, effectively mimicking the metabolic effects of Metformin?",
            "options": ["Resveratrol", "Berberine", "Curcumin", "Quercetin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine is a potent AMPK activator that improves insulin sensitivity and increases hepatic LDLR expression to clear LDL from the blood."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Elevated levels of Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] are primarily genetically determined. What is the specific physiological reason Lp(a) is significantly more atherogenic and pro-thrombotic than standard LDL?",
            "options": ["It is smaller and denser than standard LDL", "It contains apolipoprotein(a), which is structurally similar to plasminogen and inhibits fibrinolysis", "It lacks the B-100 protein required for clearance", "It has a higher affinity for HDL particles"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The apolipoprotein(a) component of Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding sites, thereby inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis) and increasing heart attack risk."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "When calibrating the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is most indicative of parasympathetic (vagal) tone and metabolic resilience?",
            "options": ["SDNN", "RMSSD", "LF/HF Ratio", "Total Power"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) is the primary time-domain measure used to estimate vagally-mediated changes reflected in HRV."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "The 'Mitochondrial Theory of Aging' highlights the depletion of specific cofactors. Which nutrient is a critical precursor for NAD+ synthesis, essential for DNA repair via PARP enzymes and sirtuin activation?",
            "options": ["Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)", "Riboflavin (B2)", "Magnesium Glycinate", "Alpha-Lipoic Acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) and Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) are direct precursors to NAD+, which is consumed by sirtuins for longevity and PARPs for DNA repair."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Metabolic Syndrome' criteria (TG: 210 mg/dL, HDL: 32 mg/dL, Fasting Glucose: 115 mg/dL). Based on Module 8 strategies, what is the most effective first-line nutritional intervention to improve the TG/HDL ratio?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate/Low-fat diet to reduce saturated fat", "Isocaloric Mediterranean diet with <50g net carbohydrates", "Vegan diet with high fruit intake for antioxidants", "Standard American Diet supplemented with a multivitamin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restricting carbohydrates (specifically refined sugars and starches) is the most effective way to lower Triglycerides and improve the TG/HDL ratio, a key marker of insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "In the 2019 NHANES study referenced in Lesson 1, what percentage of American adults were found to be 'metabolically healthy' across all five key markers (glucose, TG, HDL, BP, and waist circumference)?",
            "options": ["52%", "35%", "12%", "22%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that a staggering 88% of US adults are metabolically unhealthy, leaving only 12% who meet the criteria for optimal metabolic health."
