        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which protein is identified in Lesson 1 as the primary physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions, often used as a biomarker for increased intestinal permeability?",
            "options": ["Occludin", "Claudin-1", "Zonulin", "Vinculin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. When elevated, it signals the disassembly of tight junction proteins, leading to increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A patient's stool analysis reveals a Secretory IgA (sIgA) level significantly below the reference range (<400 mg/dL). According to the Microbiome-Immune Crosstalk lesson, what is the most likely clinical interpretation?",
            "options": ["An acute, overactive immune response to a pathogen", "Compromised mucosal immunity and reduced first-line defense", "Excessive activation of the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)", "High levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low sIgA indicates a depleted mucosal immune system, often caused by chronic stress, malnutrition, or chronic infection, leaving the patient more vulnerable to pathogens and food sensitivities."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3 (Observing GI Biomarkers), which marker is described as a highly sensitive calcium-binding protein used to differentiate between Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?",
            "options": ["Fecal Fat", "Steatocrit", "Fecal Calprotectin", "Pancreatic Elastase-1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fecal Calprotectin is a marker of neutrophil infiltration in the gut mucosa. High levels (>200 µg/g) are strongly suggestive of IBD, while low levels in a symptomatic patient point toward IBS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) differs from classic SIBO because the primary organisms involved (such as Methanobrevibacter smithii) are:",
            "options": ["Gram-negative bacteria", "Archaea that consume hydrogen to produce methane", "Fungi that ferment glucose", "Viruses that infect the brush border"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IMO is caused by Archaea, not bacteria. These organisms utilize hydrogen produced by other bacteria and carbon dioxide to produce methane gas, which is often associated with constipation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "During Step U (Uncovering Root Causes), which secondary biomarker on an Organic Acid Test (OAT) is a byproduct of bacterial tryptophan metabolism and suggests protein maldigestion due to hypochlorhydria?",
            "options": ["Indican", "Citramalate", "Arabinose", "Quinolinate"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Indican is produced when bacteria ferment undigested tryptophan. High levels on an OAT or urine test often indicate low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) or upper GI bacterial overgrowth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the Advanced 5-R Protocol, which specific intervention is most appropriate for the 'REPLACE' phase in a patient with low Pancreatic Elastase-1 (<200 µg/g)?",
            "options": ["High-dose probiotics", "L-Glutamine and Zinc Carnosine", "Exogenous digestive enzymes and/or Betaine HCl", "Antimicrobial herbs like Oregano oil"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Replace' phase focuses on restoring digestive secretions. Low Pancreatic Elastase-1 indicates exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, requiring supplemental enzymes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses biofilms. What is the primary reason that pathogens within a biofilm matrix are up to 1,000 times more resistant to antimicrobials than planktonic bacteria?",
            "options": ["They lack a cell wall for antibiotics to target", "The Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) matrix acts as a physical and chemical shield", "Biofilm bacteria divide 10 times faster than normal bacteria", "Biofilms only form in the presence of heavy metals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The EPS matrix (composed of DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides) prevents the penetration of antimicrobials and protects the colony from the host's immune cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "According to the Gut-Brain Axis lesson, which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is the primary fuel source for colonocytes and plays a critical role in maintaining the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) integrity?",
            "options": ["Acetate", "Propionate", "Butyrate", "Succinate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is essential for gut barrier health and has systemic anti-inflammatory effects, including the upregulation of tight junction proteins in the blood-brain barrier."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that metabolic endotoxemia—the translocation of LPS into the blood—is a primary driver of which systemic condition?",
            "options": ["Type 1 Diabetes", "Low-grade systemic inflammation and insulin resistance", "Acute appendicitis", "Hyperthyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation through a leaky gut triggers TLR4 receptors, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation, which is a known driver of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "When calibrating the Gut-Brain Axis (Step C), which nerve is the primary conduit for the 'bottom-up' signaling of gut-derived inflammatory cytokines to the brain?",
            "options": ["Phrenic nerve", "Vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X)", "Sciatic nerve", "Trigeminal nerve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve provides the main bidirectional communication pathway between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system, sensing gut inflammation and microbiota metabolites."
