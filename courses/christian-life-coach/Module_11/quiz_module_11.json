            "question": "According to the lesson on neuroplasticity, how does the biological process of 'synaptic pruning' relate to the biblical mandate in Romans 12:2?",
            "options": [
                "It suggests the brain is fixed and cannot be transformed after childhood.",
                "It is the physical mechanism where unused 'old self' neural pathways weaken while new 'renewed' pathways are strengthened.",
                "It refers to the removal of the frontal lobe's influence during prayer.",
                "It proves that spiritual growth is entirely independent of physical brain structures."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synaptic pruning is the biological equivalent of 'putting off the old self'; as we stop ruminating on toxic thoughts and focus on 'whatever is true' (Phil 4:8), the physical connections for those old thoughts weaken and are eventually pruned."

                "DNA is mutated permanently by sin and cannot be altered by spiritual practice.",
                "Generational patterns are purely social and have no biological basis.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics shows that environmental factors and trauma can influence gene expression across generations, providing a scientific parallel to the biblical concept of generational patterns and the need for intentional 'uprooting'."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Research on 'Post-Traumatic Growth' (PTG) indicates that what percentage of survivors report positive psychological change following a crisis, supporting a biblical theology of suffering?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
