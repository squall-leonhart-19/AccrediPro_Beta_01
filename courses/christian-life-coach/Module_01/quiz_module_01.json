            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the Greek term 'Parakaleo' is identified as the theological root for Christian coaching. What is the primary functional definition of this term in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "To provide clinical diagnosis and treatment for past trauma",
                "To call alongside, encourage, and exhort toward future growth",
                "To exercise ecclesiastical authority over a subordinate",
                "To strictly provide biblical instruction without client input"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parakaleo literally means 'to call alongside.' In Christian coaching, this represents the coach walking with the client to encourage and exhort them toward their God-given potential, rather than focusing on clinical pathology."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Identity in Christ' framework (Lesson 2), what is the primary danger of performance-based coaching for the Christian client?",
            "options": [
                "It leads to a 'works-righteousness' mindset where value is tied to achievement",
                "It increases the client's speed of goal attainment too quickly",
                "It focuses too heavily on the Imago Dei at the expense of productivity",
                "It prevents the coach from charging professional fees"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Performance-based coaching can inadvertently reinforce the belief that a client's worth is tied to their output. Christian coaching must ground the client in their 'Being' (Identity in Christ) before focusing on 'Doing' (Goals)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Scriptural Authority. When a client's goals directly contradict biblical principles, what is the ethical 'Scriptural Mirror' approach for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the coaching relationship without explanation",
                "Ignore the contradiction to maintain a positive coaching rapport",
                "Use Socratic questioning to help the client view their goal through the lens of Scripture",
                "Override the client's autonomy and dictate a new set of biblical goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Scriptural Mirror' approach involves using powerful questions to help the client reflect on their own alignment with the Word, honoring both Scriptural authority and the client's volitional responsibility."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Ethics and Integrity' (Lesson 4), which of the following scenarios constitutes a 'Referral Trigger' requiring a transition from coaching to clinical counseling?",

                "A client who wants to transition to a new career path"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches work with the 'functional' population. If a client exhibits signs of clinical pathology, such as deep depression or self-harm, the ethical requirement is to refer them to a licensed mental health professional."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 distinguishes between a 'Contract' and a 'Covenant.' What is a defining characteristic of a 'Coaching Covenant'?",

                "It is a transactional agreement based solely on the exchange of money for services",
                "It is a relational commitment that reflects the 'Hesed' (steadfast love) of God",
                "It is a secret agreement that bypasses standard business ethics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a contract is legal and transactional, a covenant is a relational and spiritual commitment. It reflects the biblical concept of 'Hesed,' emphasizing mutual growth, trust, and presence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metanoia (repentance/renewal of the mind) aligns with neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections in response to new thoughts and behaviors (Romans 12:2)."

            "id": "q1_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Christian coaching acknowledges the Holy Spirit as the 'Senior Coach.' The human coach facilitates the space, but true transformation and revelation come from the Spirit's work in the client's heart."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Case Study Application: A client, 'Sarah,' is obsessed with achieving a promotion to prove her worth to her estranged father. Which foundational concept from Module 1 should the coach prioritize?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is operating out of a 'deficit identity.' The coach must first help her anchor her worth in her identity as God's child (Lesson 2) before the promotion becomes a healthy goal rather than a validation seeking mechanism."
