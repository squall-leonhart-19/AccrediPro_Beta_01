            "question": "A client reveals persistent symptoms of clinical depression, including suicidal ideation and an inability to perform daily tasks. According to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines (L2), what is the coach’s ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the frequency of coaching sessions to provide better support.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional and cease coaching until stabilized.",
                "Incorporate more intensive prayer and deliverance ministry into the sessions.",
                "Ask the client to sign an additional waiver acknowledging the coach is not a therapist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches work with 'functional' clients on future-oriented goals. Clinical pathology, especially suicidal ideation, falls outside the coaching scope and requires an immediate referral to a clinical professional."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Theological Foundations' (L1), the concept of 'Imago Dei' primarily dictates that the coach should:",
            "options": [
                "Ensure the client adopts the coach's specific denominational views.",
                "Treat every client with inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their presenting issues.",
                "Focus exclusively on the client's spiritual failures rather than their goals.",
                "Charge lower fees to those who demonstrate more 'godly' character."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Imago Dei (Image of God) foundation establishes that every human possesses inherent dignity, which forms the basis for ethical respect, autonomy, and unbiased care in coaching."

        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A coach is operating in a small rural church where their client is also their child’s Sunday School teacher. According to Lesson 4 on Dual Relationships, what is the best course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the relationship to avoid making the client feel uncomfortable.",
                "Immediately terminate the coaching relationship to avoid any conflict.",
                "Discuss the dual relationship openly, set clear boundaries, and document the management plan.",
                "Ask the client to step down from teaching Sunday School during the coaching term."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In faith communities, dual relationships are often unavoidable. The ethical approach is 'Boundary Management'—openly discussing the dynamic, setting limits, and documenting how the professional boundary will be maintained."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "Regarding 'Mandatory Reporting' (L3), if a client in a confidential session discloses that they are currently neglecting the basic physical needs of their elderly parent, the coach must:",

                "Report the suspicion of elder abuse to the appropriate state authorities as required by law.",
                "Discuss the matter with the church elders before taking any legal action.",
                "Advise the client to pray for more patience and strength in caregiving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality is not absolute. Mandatory reporting laws generally cover child abuse, elder abuse, and threats of harm to self or others. Ethical Christian coaching adheres to these legal requirements."

                "They are discouraged in favor of transparent, pre-established professional fees to avoid power imbalances.",
                "They should only be accepted if they exceed the coach's standard hourly rate.",
                "They are the only biblical way to receive compensation for ministry-related work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional stewardship requires transparency. Relying on 'love offerings' can create ambiguity, financial instability, and unhealthy power dynamics. Clear fee structures protect both the coach and the client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical integration of spiritual disciplines requires 'Informed Consent.' Clients should know ahead of time how spiritual elements will be used and have the right to decline them without penalty."

                "Ignore the request and never mention it to avoid embarrassment.",
                "Accept the request but put the client in a 'restricted' viewing list."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a 'Digital Boundary' is crucial. Mixing personal and professional digital lives can lead to boundary blurring and privacy violations. Coaches should maintain separate professional personas."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "A 2021 study on referral networks (L8) indicated that collaborative care can improve client outcomes by 30%. In this context, 'Collaborative Care' means:",

            "explanation": "Collaborative care involves a multidisciplinary approach where professionals (with the client's explicit, written consent) coordinate efforts to support the client's holistic well-being."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Spiritual bypassing is an ethical concern because it prevents genuine healing and growth by using 'God talk' or religious rituals to ignore or suppress real-world problems or trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Financial integrity requires honesty and proactivity. Correcting billing errors immediately builds trust and aligns with the biblical mandate for 'just weights and measures' (Proverbs 11:1)."
