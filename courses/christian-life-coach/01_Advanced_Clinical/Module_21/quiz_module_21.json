                "Secular treatment focuses on the past, while Christian planning focuses only on the future.",
                "Christian planning views the client as a steward of God-given potential rather than a broken machine to be fixed.",

                "Secular treatment is evidence-based, while Christian planning is purely intuitive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that biblical growth planning is rooted in the doctrine of stewardship (Matthew 25:14-30), viewing the client's life and sanctification as a trust from God rather than a clinical deficit to be repaired."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As taught in Lesson 2, identifying patterns that are Persistent (time-bound), Pervasive (affects multiple life domains), and Power-draining (saps spiritual vitality) allows the coach to target root causes rather than symptoms."
