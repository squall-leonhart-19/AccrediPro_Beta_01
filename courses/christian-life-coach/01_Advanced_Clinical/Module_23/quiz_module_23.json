            "question": "According to the lesson on Neuro-Biblical Integration, a 2021 study demonstrated that consistent meditation on Scripture for 12 minutes daily significantly increased density in which brain region associated with empathy and emotional regulation?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that focused spiritual meditation strengthens the Anterior Cingulate Cortex, which acts as a bridge between the emotional limbic system and the analytical prefrontal cortex, facilitating 'metanoia' or cognitive renewal."

            "question": "In the context of Spiritual Discernment (L2), how is 'Spiritual Desolation' primarily distinguished from clinical depression in a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "Desolation is always accompanied by physical lethargy and sleep disturbances.",
                "Desolation is characterized by a felt distance from God despite a desire for Him, whereas depression often involves a global loss of interest (anhedonia).",
                "Desolation only occurs in non-believers who lack the Holy Spirit.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are treated with the same cognitive tools."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual discernment identifies desolation as a temporary state of 'soul-dryness' where the client still yearns for God, whereas clinical depression is a broader psychological condition requiring different therapeutic interventions."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Somatic Theology (L3) utilizes the 'Vagus Nerve' as a physiological bridge for spiritual peace. Which technique is most effective for a client experiencing a 'fight-or-flight' response during prayer?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid-fire intercessory prayer",
                "Exhalations longer than inhalations (4-7-8 breathing) paired with 'Breath Prayers'",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to improve mental focus",
                "Suppression of all physical sensations to focus on the spirit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system via the Vagus nerve, allowing the body to enter a state of 'Sabbath rest' that facilitates deeper spiritual connection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Joseph Effect reframes past trauma ('man meant it for evil') into a redemptive arc ('God meant it for good'), shifting the client's identity from a victim of circumstances to a participant in a divine plan."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "A coach uses a 'Paradoxical Intervention' (L5) by asking a perfectionist client to 'intentionally fail at one minor task this week.' Which biblical principle does this mirror?",

                "The Parable of the Talents",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical interventions disrupt the 'Law of Reversed Effort' by embracing weakness to find God's strength, aligning with the biblical paradox that His power is made perfect in our infirmities."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "Prophetic Listening (L6) involves 'The Third Ear.' What is the primary objective when a coach identifies a 'Holy Spirit Prompt' that contradicts the client's current logic?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately command the client to change their mind",
                "To ignore the prompt if it isn't in the coach's notes",
                "To offer it as a 'weighted inquiry' for the client to test against Scripture and peace",
                "To tell the client exactly what God said without question"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced coaching requires humility; intuitive prompts are offered as inquiries for the client's own discernment process, ensuring the coach remains a facilitator rather than a mediator."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The data suggests that over 65% of persistent negative mindsets (strongholds) are reinforced by cognitive fusion, where the client fails to 'take every thought captive' as commanded in 2 Corinthians 10:5."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "Suggest she stop praying entirely for a month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical interventions for OCD/Anxiety often involve 'leaning into' the fear to prove its lack of power, which breaks the cycle of reassurance-seeking and highlights the sufficiency of grace."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Hero's Return' focuses on the redemptive value of the trial—what the client brings back from the 'wilderness' to bless others, shifting the focus from loss to stewardship."
