            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Advanced Endocrine Disruptors, through which mechanism do EDCs like phthalates primarily exert transgenerational epigenetic effects on the F2 generation?",
            "options": [
                "Direct mutation of the DNA sequence in somatic cells",
                "Alterations in germline DNA methylation during primordial germ cell development",
                "Permanent destruction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis",
                "Immediate reduction in the total oocyte pool of the F0 generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs influence future generations by altering the 'epigenetic programming' (specifically DNA methylation and histone modification) of germ cells while they are developing in utero, affecting individuals who were never directly exposed."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the study of the Gut-Vagina-Uterus axis, what percentage of Lactobacillus dominance in the endometrial microbiota is identified as a threshold for significantly higher implantation and live birth rates?",
            "options": [
                ">50%",
                ">75%",
                ">90%",
                "100% (Absolute purity)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into the uterine microbiome indicates that a 'Lactobacillus-dominated' environment (>90% Lactobacillus) is correlated with significantly better reproductive outcomes compared to non-Lactobacillus dominated environments."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Hyperinsulinemia impacts egg quality by stimulating the theca cells to overproduce which of the following, leading to follicular arrest?",
            "options": [
                "Androgens",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels act synergistically with LH to stimulate theca cell androgen production. This creates an androgenic microenvironment that inhibits follicle maturation and impairs oocyte quality."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client's lab work shows an LH:FSH ratio of 3:1 and an AMH of 5.8 ng/mL. Based on Module 14's Biomarker Deep Dive, what is the most likely clinical interpretation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An LH:FSH ratio greater than 2:1, combined with an elevated AMH (typically >3.5-4.0 ng/mL), is a classic biomarker signature for PCOS, reflecting high follicular density and dysregulated gonadotropin signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "During chronic stress, the activation of the HPA axis leads to the release of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH). How does CRH specifically affect the HPO axis?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the release of GnRH to increase fertility",
                "It inhibits GnRH pulsatility, leading to suppressed LH and FSH",
                "It increases the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH",
                "It has no direct effect on the reproductive system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CRH and stress-induced beta-endorphins directly inhibit the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, which leads to lower levels of LH and FSH, potentially causing anovulation or luteal phase defects."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which metric in advanced paternal testing is considered a superior predictor of miscarriage risk compared to standard semen analysis parameters (count/motility)?",

                "Fructose levels in seminal fluid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI), often caused by oxidative stress, is strongly linked to recurrent pregnancy loss and failed IVF outcomes, even when traditional parameters like count and motility appear normal."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In the context of Endometriosis (Module 14, Lesson 7), which cytokine is typically elevated in the peritoneal fluid and is known to impair sperm-egg interaction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is significantly elevated in the peritoneal environment of endometriosis patients, contributing to pelvic inflammation and reduced fertility."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Optimization lesson, what is the 'Optimal' range for HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) for a client trying to conceive?",

                "< 1.0",
                "< 1.5",
                "2.0 - 3.0",
                "> 4.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While clinical 'normal' may go higher, fertility optimization targets a HOMA-IR of < 1.5 to ensure maximum insulin sensitivity and metabolic health for oocyte development."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (32) has had two early miscarriages. Her hs-CRP is 4.5 mg/L and her homocysteine is 14 μmol/L. Based on the Practitioner's Blueprint, what is the primary clinical focus?",

                "Increasing caffeine intake for energy",
                "Aggressive weight loss through caloric restriction",

                "Immediate referral for egg donation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": " Sarah's elevated hs-CRP (>3.0) indicates systemic inflammation, and her high homocysteine (>10) suggests methylation issues, both of which are risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss and require targeted nutritional/lifestyle intervention."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "What is the 'window of opportunity' for paternal programming, where lifestyle interventions can most significantly impact the epigenetic health of the sperm?",
            "options": [
                "7-10 days",
                "24-48 hours",
                "72-90 days",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because the cycle of spermatogenesis takes approximately 72 to 90 days, this 3-month window is the critical period for implementing lifestyle changes to improve sperm DNA quality and epigenetic markers."
