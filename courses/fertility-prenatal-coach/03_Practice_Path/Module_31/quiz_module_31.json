                "It is required by most insurance providers for reimbursement.",
                "It prevents clients from asking for refunds if they do not conceive."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Outcome-based pricing positions the coach as a specialist who delivers a specific result, making the investment about the value of that result (a baby) rather than an arbitrary hourly rate."
