            "options": [
                "The number of hours worked per week divided by total revenue.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Leverage Ratio measures how much impact or revenue is generated per unit of time. In group coaching, a high leverage ratio means serving more clients (e.g., 20) in the same time previously spent on one client (1 hour)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-ticket 'tripwire' product (usually $7-$47) converts a lead into a customer quickly, lowering the psychological barrier to purchase and establishing a financial relationship before pitching high-ticket services."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket coaching requires a significant investment of time and energy. Application funnels filter out 'tire kickers' and ensure the coach only speaks with leads who are a high-fit for the program's specific outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Founder Trap' occurs when a business cannot function without the owner. Investors or buyers want a 'turnkey' system; if the brand is tied exclusively to the founder's face and name, the business has low 'transferable value'."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
