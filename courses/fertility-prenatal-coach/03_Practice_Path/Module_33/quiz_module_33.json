                "Tell the client that supplements are unregulated and therefore do not fall under medical boundaries."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To stay within the coaching scope of practice and avoid 'practicing medicine without a license,' coaches must provide education and research summaries rather than clinical prescriptions or specific dosages for medical conditions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Claims-made policies require the insurance to be in effect at the time of the claim. If a coach switches providers or retires, they often need 'tail coverage' to protect against future claims from past events."
