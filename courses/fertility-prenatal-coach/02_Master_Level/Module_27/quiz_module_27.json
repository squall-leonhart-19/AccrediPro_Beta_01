        {
            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "Which PCOS phenotype is characterized by 'Classic' presentation, including clinical hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, and typically carries the highest risk for metabolic syndrome?",
            "options": ["Phenotype A", "Phenotype B", "Phenotype C", "Phenotype D"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phenotype A is the 'classic' and most severe form of PCOS, meeting all three Rotterdam criteria and exhibiting the highest rates of insulin resistance and metabolic risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "In clients with Endometriosis, 'Progesterone Resistance' is a key pathological feature. What is the primary cellular consequence of this resistance during the luteal phase?",
            "options": ["Excessive thickening of the endometrium", "Inadequate decidualization of the uterine lining", "Premature surge of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)", "Suppression of Prostaglandin E2"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone resistance in endometriosis prevents the endometrium from undergoing proper decidualization, which is essential for embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A 39-year-old client is preparing for an IVF cycle due to Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR). Based on clinical evidence for mitochondrial support, what is the recommended daily dosage and timing for CoQ10 (Ubiquinol) supplementation?",
            "options": ["100mg daily starting on Day 1 of stimulation", "200mg daily for 2 weeks prior to retrieval", "600mg daily for at least 8-12 weeks prior to retrieval", "1000mg daily only during the down-regulation phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To improve oocyte mitochondrial function and ATP production, 600mg of CoQ10 for approximately 3 months (the duration of oogenesis) is the standard evidence-based protocol for AMA/DOR."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Regarding Male Factor Infertility, a Sperm DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) above what percentage is clinically associated with significantly lower natural conception rates and increased miscarriage risk?",
            "options": ["10%", "15%", "30%", "50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A DFI > 30% is considered high fragmentation, which correlates with reduced fertility, poor embryo quality, and a higher risk of recurrent pregnancy loss."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In cases of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) linked to Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), what is the gold-standard integrative medical intervention used alongside lifestyle support?",
            "options": ["High-dose Vitamin C and E", "Low-dose Aspirin (LDA) and Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)", "Progesterone-only therapy", "Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of Low-dose Aspirin and Heparin (LMWH) is the evidence-based standard for preventing thrombotic events and improving live birth rates in APS-related RPL."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Which hormone, produced by the granulosa cells of pre-antral follicles, is considered the most reliable marker for Ovarian Reserve as it remains relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": ["Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)", "Estradiol (E2)", "Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)", "Inhibin B"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMH levels reflect the size of the primordial follicle pool and do not fluctuate significantly with the menstrual cycle, making it a superior marker for ovarian reserve compared to FSH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Secondary Infertility' 18 months after her first child. She is still breastfeeding twice daily. What is the most likely physiological mechanism hindering her current conception efforts?",
            "options": ["Elevated Prolactin inhibiting GnRH pulsatility", "Permanent depletion of ovarian reserve", "Postpartum Estrogen Dominance", "Uterine scarring from the previous birth"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactational amenorrhea/subfertility is driven by Prolactin, which suppresses the pulsatile release of GnRH, thereby inhibiting LH surges and ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In 'Reciprocal IVF' for same-sex female couples, which of the following describes the procedure correctly?",
            "options": ["Both partners undergo egg retrieval to create a combined embryo", "One partner provides the oocytes while the other partner carries the pregnancy", "A surrogate carries the embryo created from one partner's egg", "Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) is performed on both partners simultaneously"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reciprocal IVF allows both partners to be physically involved: one undergoes stimulation and retrieval (genetic parent), and the other undergoes the transfer and carries the pregnancy (gestational parent)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "When addressing Insulin Resistance in PCOS Phenotype B (non-polycystic), what specific ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol has been shown to most effectively restore ovulatory function and improve insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": ["1:1", "10:1", "40:1", "100:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol mimics the physiological ratio found in plasma and is the most effective for metabolic and ovulatory improvements in PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Advanced Maternal Age (AMA) is clinically defined as age 35 or older. What is the primary biological driver for the increased rate of aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities) in this population?",
            "options": ["Increased uterine fibroid growth", "Degradation of the meiotic spindle fibers in the oocyte", "Decline in cervical mucus quality", "Reduced blood flow to the pelvic floor"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As oocytes age, the proteins responsible for the meiotic spindle (which separates chromosomes) degrade, leading to errors in chromosomal segregation and higher rates of aneuploidy."
