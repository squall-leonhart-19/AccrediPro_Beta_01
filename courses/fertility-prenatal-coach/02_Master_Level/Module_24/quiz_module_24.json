            "question": "In the CONCEIVE Synthesis™ framework, which phase specifically addresses the 'Environmental Load and Detoxification Pathways' as a primary driver of egg quality?",
            "options": [
                "Phase C: Core Foundations",
                "Phase E: Environmental Clearance",
                "Phase I: Immune Modulation",
                "Phase V: Vascular Optimization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase E (Environmental Clearance) in the CONCEIVE Synthesis™ focuses on identifying and reducing endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and optimizing Phase I and II liver detoxification to improve the follicular environment."

            "question": "The Barker Hypothesis, central to Primordial Prevention Mastery, suggests that the intrauterine environment can program the fetus for which of the following long-term outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Only immediate birth weight and gestational age",
                "Genetic mutations that are irreversible after birth",
                "Epigenetic 'programming' of metabolic, endocrine, and cardiovascular health in adulthood",
                "The gender of the offspring's future children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Barker Hypothesis (or DOHaD) posits that environmental exposures during critical windows of development (prenatal) program the offspring's physiology, increasing the risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes and CVD later in life."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When interpreting functional fertility labs, a client with an AMH of 0.8 ng/mL and a Day 3 FSH of 14 mIU/mL most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)",
                "Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)",
                "Optimal fertility for her age group",
                "A high likelihood of hyperstimulation during IVF"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An AMH below 1.0 ng/mL combined with an elevated FSH (typically >10-12 mIU/mL) is a classic functional indicator of Diminished Ovarian Reserve, requiring more aggressive mitochondrial support."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to the Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology (NEI) of Conception, what is the ideal cytokine shift required for successful embryo implantation?",
            "options": [
                "A shift from Th2 dominance to Th1 dominance",
                "A shift from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory) dominance",
                "Complete suppression of all T-cell activity",
                "A 500% increase in Natural Killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implantation requires a delicate 'immunological switch' where the maternal immune system shifts from a Th1 (pro-inflammatory/rejection) state to a Th2 (anti-inflammatory/tolerance) state to accept the semi-allogeneic embryo."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In the management of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL), what percentage of cases are attributed to 'unexplained' factors, often involving underlying immune or epigenetic dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "Up to 50%",
                "Nearly 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that in approximately 50% of RPL cases, standard medical testing (karyotyping, uterine scans) finds no cause, highlighting the need for functional and NEI-based interventions."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "For a client undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), meta-analyses suggest that initiating CoQ10 (Ubiquinol) supplementation is most effective when started how long before oocyte retrieval?",
            "options": [
                "1 week before retrieval",
                "Only during the stimulation phase",
                "At least 90 days prior to retrieval",
                "Immediately after the embryo transfer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because the final stages of oocyte maturation (folliculogenesis) take approximately 90-100 days, mitochondrial support like CoQ10 must be present throughout this window to significantly impact egg quality."

            "question": "A Master Practitioner using Somatic Coaching identifies a client in a 'Hypo-aroused' state (collapse/numbness). Which intervention is most appropriate for Trauma-Informed Fertility Care?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive HIIT exercise to force the heart rate up",
                "Gentle sensory grounding and micro-movements to return to the Window of Tolerance",
                "Deep tissue massage to release muscle tension",
                "Ignoring the state and focusing strictly on lab results"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In somatic work, hypo-arousal is a survival response. Practitioners use gentle grounding and small, safe movements to help the client's nervous system regulate back into the Window of Tolerance without re-traumatization."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In the context of Master Practitioner Leadership, what is the primary purpose of a 'Collaborative Care Map'?",
            "options": [
                "To replace the need for a Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE)",
                "To track the client's supplement dosages only",
                "To coordinate communication and roles between the coach, RE, acupuncturist, and therapist",
                "To provide a legal disclaimer for the coach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners lead by integrating various modalities. A Collaborative Care Map ensures all providers are aligned, reducing client stress and preventing contraindicated treatments."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "Research into Secondary Infertility shows it accounts for what proportion of infertility cases, often linked to 'post-partum depletion' and unresolved inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 10%",
                "Approximately 30%",
                "Approximately 60%",
                "Secondary infertility is a myth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Global statistics, including data from the WHO, indicate that secondary infertility (inability to conceive after a previous live birth) is actually more common than primary infertility, accounting for roughly 60% of cases."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Advanced interpretation of the 'Cortisol Awakening Response' (CAR) on a functional lab test provides insight into which aspect of fertility?",
            "options": [
                "The client's ovarian reserve",
                "The HPA-axis resiliency and the body's 'readiness' for the stress of pregnancy",
                "The exact day of ovulation",
                "The quality of the husband's sperm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a marker of HPA-axis plasticity. A blunted or exaggerated CAR suggests the client's neuro-endocrine system is struggling to manage stress, which can downregulate the HPO-axis and inhibit GnRH pulsatility."
