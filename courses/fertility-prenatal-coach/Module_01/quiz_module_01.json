            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oocytes have the highest concentration of mitochondria of any cell. These mitochondria provide the energy (ATP) necessary for the complex processes of fertilization and initial cell divisions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Barker Hypothesis suggests that the intrauterine environment and preconception health 'program' the fetus, influencing the risk of adult-onset diseases like Type 2 diabetes and CVD."
