            "question": "Why is the '90-day window' considered the critical period for pre-conception priming?",
            "options": [
                "It is the time required for a primordial follicle to develop into a mature, ovulatory egg.",
                "It is the exact lifespan of a human egg once it has been released from the ovary.",
                "It is the minimum time required for the liver to completely regenerate its detoxification enzymes.",
                "It represents the total duration of a standard menstrual cycle multiplied by three."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The recruitment and maturation of a follicle from the primordial stage to the pre-ovulatory stage takes approximately 90-100 days, making this window the primary opportunity to influence egg quality through nutrition and lifestyle."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the context of metabolic detoxification, what is the primary risk of having a highly active Phase I pathway with a sluggish Phase II pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrients are excreted too quickly before they can be utilized by the developing oocyte.",
                "The accumulation of highly reactive intermediate metabolites that can cause cellular and DNA damage.",
                "The body enters a state of permanent ketosis, which is contraindicated for fertility.",
                "Phase III transporters become over-saturated, leading to kidney stones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase I creates intermediate metabolites (often more toxic than the original substance). If Phase II (conjugation) is slow, these reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage DNA in eggs and sperm."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client presents with signs of 'estrogen dominance' despite normal production. Her stool test shows elevated beta-glucuronidase. What is the mechanism occurring in her estrobolome?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-glucuronidase is destroying estrogen before it can reach the uterus.",
                "The enzyme is converting progesterone into estrogen in the lower GI tract.",
                "The enzyme is 'un-coupling' conjugated estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation.",
                "Beta-glucuronidase is blocking the absorption of Vitamin D, which regulates estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the 'de-conjugated' estrogen to re-enter the bloodstream via the portal vein."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to the 2013 LIFE Study, couples with the highest concentrations of certain phthalates took how much longer to conceive compared to those with the lowest levels?",

                "5% longer",
                "20% longer",

                "Phthalates were found to have no statistical impact on time-to-pregnancy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research, including the LIFE study, indicates that high exposure to EDCs like phthalates can result in a 20% reduction in fecundity, significantly increasing the time-to-pregnancy (TTP)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NAC is the rate-limiting precursor for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is essential for the glutathione-S-transferase pathway in Phase II detoxification."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, what is identified as the 'optimal' functional range for HbA1c when priming for pregnancy to minimize oxidative stress on the follicles?",
            "options": [
                "4.8% to 5.2%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' medical ranges go up to 5.6%, functional fertility standards aim for 4.8% to 5.2% to ensure stable blood sugar and minimal insulin-driven androgen production."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III involves the transport of conjugated toxins out of the cell and into the bile or urine for final elimination from the body via the GI tract or kidneys."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Heating plastics leaches bisphenols and phthalates into food. Switching to glass is a highly effective, evidence-based way to reduce daily EDC exposure immediately."

            "question": "A practitioner is crafting a protocol for a client with a history of heavy metal exposure. Why is it recommended to perform the 'Cleanse' phase BEFORE active conception attempts begin?",
            "options": [
                "Because detoxification supplements are the only way to ensure twins.",
                "To avoid the mobilization of stored toxins into the bloodstream during pregnancy, where they can cross the placenta.",
                "Because Phase II nutrients are toxic to a developing fetus.",
                "There is no reason; cleansing should be done during the first trimester for maximum effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight loss or aggressive detox during pregnancy can mobilize heavy metals (like lead and mercury) and persistent organic pollutants from adipose tissue and bone into the blood, potentially exposing the fetus."
