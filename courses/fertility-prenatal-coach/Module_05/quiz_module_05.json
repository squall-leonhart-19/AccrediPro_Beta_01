            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that women with unexplained infertility had significantly higher blood concentrations of which heavy metal compared to fertile controls?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lead (Pb) is a potent reproductive toxin that interferes with the HPO axis and increases oxidative stress in the follicular fluid, significantly correlating with unexplained infertility."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In environmental medicine, source removal is the 'gold standard' intervention, as it stops the emission of toxins at the point of origin rather than attempting to filter them later."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In the context of Personal Care Products (Lesson 5), why are Parabens (e.g., Methylparaben) specifically concerning for fertility patients?",
            "options": [
                "They are potent neurotoxins",
                "They act as xenoestrogens, binding to estrogen receptors",
                "They cause immediate skin irritation",
                "They prevent the absorption of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parabens are endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen (xenoestrogens), potentially leading to estrogen dominance and disrupting the delicate hormonal balance required for ovulation."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often called 'forever chemicals,' are most commonly introduced into the 'Fertility-Friendly Kitchen' through which source?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PFAS are used to create non-stick surfaces. When heated or scratched, these chemicals can leach into food and have been linked to delayed time-to-pregnancy (TTP)."

            "question": "According to Lesson 7, how does evening exposure to 'Blue Light' (450-490nm) specifically interfere with the reproductive cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It increases progesterone production too early",
                "It suppresses melatonin, which is a key antioxidant for protecting oocytes",
                "It causes immediate DNA fragmentation in sperm",
                "It prevents the absorption of folic acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is not just a sleep hormone; it is a powerful antioxidant found in high concentrations in follicular fluid. Blue light suppresses melatonin, depriving the developing egg of its primary nocturnal protection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The bedroom represents the longest continuous exposure period (sleep). Optimizing air quality and bedding provides the highest 'return on investment' for reducing the daily body burden."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Meeker et al.) has shown that high BPA levels are associated with significantly lower oocyte counts (roughly 24%) and decreased fertilization success in clinical settings."
