            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score of 2.4. Based on the module content, how should this be interpreted in a fertility context?",
            "options": [
                "This is an optimal score for preconception, indicating high insulin sensitivity.",
                "This indicates early-stage insulin resistance, which can impair the theca cell response and disrupt androgen production.",
                "This score is only relevant for type 2 diabetics and has no bearing on ovulatory function.",
                "This indicates severe hypoglycemia and requires immediate sugar supplementation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 is often indicative of early insulin resistance. In fertility, elevated insulin stimulates the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, frequently leading to ovulatory dysfunction."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which specific enzyme, produced by an imbalanced estrobolome, is responsible for deconjugating estrogen in the gut, leading to its reabsorption into circulation?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase",
                "Lipoprotein lipase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Aromatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the 're-activated' estrogen to re-enter the bloodstream, contributing to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on the vaginal microbiome, which species is considered the 'gold standard' for a protective environment and is associated with higher rates of embryo implantation?",
            "options": [
                "Lactobacillus crispatus",
                "Gardnerella vaginalis",

                "Atopobium vaginae"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactobacillus crispatus produces high levels of D-lactic acid, which maintains a low pH and creates a stable environment conducive to healthy implantation, whereas L. iners is often associated with a more transitional or dysbiotic state."

            "question": "In the context of metabolic flexibility, what is the primary benefit of the body's ability to efficiently switch between oxidizing carbohydrates and fats for reproductive health?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the client to eat unlimited calories without weight gain.",
                "It ensures a steady ATP supply to the oocytes and prevents oxidative stress caused by chronic glucose reliance.",
                "It completely eliminates the need for prenatal vitamins.",
                "It prevents the body from ever entering a state of ketosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility ensures that the mitochondria (especially in high-demand cells like oocytes) can utilize different fuel sources efficiently, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with 'glucose flickering'."

            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2 found that women with the highest dietary glycemic load (GL) had a significantly higher risk of ovulatory infertility. What was the reported percentage increase in risk?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies, including the Nurses' Health Study II, have shown that women in the highest quintile of glycemic load consumption had a 91% higher risk of ovulatory infertility compared to those in the lowest quintile."

            "options": [
                "SIBO bacteria directly infect the fetus in the first trimester.",
                "Malabsorption of key nutrients like Vitamin B12 and iron, and increased systemic inflammation (LPS translocation), can compromise fetal development.",
                "SIBO is the only known cause of morning sickness.",
                "Pregnancy hormones like progesterone actually cure SIBO by increasing motility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SIBO causes nutrient malabsorption and increases intestinal permeability. The resulting systemic inflammation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation can create a pro-inflammatory environment that is sub-optimal for pregnancy."

                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and methylation. For individuals with MTHFR genetic variations, synthetic folic acid may not be efficiently converted to the active form, making 5-MTHF (methylfolate) the preferred supplemental form."

            "question": "A client presents with bloating, constipation, and heavy, painful periods. Her stool test shows high Beta-glucuronidase. Which dietary intervention is most specific for supporting the clearance of deconjugated estrogens?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of simple sugars for quick energy.",
                "Eliminating all fermented foods to reduce bacteria.",

                "A low-protein, high-fat carnivore diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cruciferous vegetables contain compounds that support glucuronidation, and fiber helps bind and excrete the hormones. Calcium-D-Glucarate specifically inhibits the beta-glucuronidase enzyme."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain optimal insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammatory spikes, a postprandial glucose level of under 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) at the 1-hour mark is generally targeted in a preconception setting."
