            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches must avoid 'prescribing' specific dosages or 'diagnosing/curing' conditions. Their role is to provide education and evidence-based options for the client to discuss with their medical provider."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner redirects their own feelings or experiences onto the client, which can cloud professional judgment, especially in the emotionally charged field of fertility."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Undisclosed financial incentives create a conflict of interest, as the coach's recommendation may be motivated by profit rather than the client's best interest. Transparency is required for ethical integrity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
