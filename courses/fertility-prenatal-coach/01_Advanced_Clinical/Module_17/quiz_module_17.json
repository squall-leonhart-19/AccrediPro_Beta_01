            "question": "According to updated ESHRE and ASRM guidelines discussed in Lesson 1, what is the current clinical definition of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL)?",
            "options": [
                "Three or more consecutive losses before 20 weeks gestation",
                "Two or more documented pregnancy losses, not necessarily consecutive",
                "Any two losses occurring within a 12-month period",
                "Five or more losses involving biochemical pregnancies only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While older definitions required three consecutive losses, modern clinical guidelines (ESHRE/ASRM) now define RPL as the loss of two or more pregnancies to facilitate earlier investigation and intervention."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In a client with Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR), which biomarker is considered the most reliable for predicting 'quantitative' egg supply because it is produced by antral follicles and is cycle-independent?",
            "options": [
                "Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)",
                "Estradiol (E2)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMH is produced by the granulosa cells of small antral and pre-antral follicles; unlike FSH, it does not fluctuate significantly throughout the menstrual cycle, making it the gold standard for assessing egg quantity."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights the 'Inflammatory Challenge' of Endometriosis. Which specific mechanism explains how pelvic inflammation affects fertility in these clients?",
            "options": [
                "Cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 in the peritoneal fluid impair oocyte quality and sperm motility",
                "High progesterone levels prevent the thickening of the endometrial lining",
                "A total lack of pelvic blood flow prevents embryo nourishment",
                "Increased vaginal pH levels neutralize sperm before they reach the cervix"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis creates a pro-inflammatory environment where elevated cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in the peritoneal fluid can damage the spindle apparatus of the oocyte and reduce the swimming capacity of sperm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client's partner is diagnosed with Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA). What does this diagnosis specifically imply regarding his reproductive health?",
            "options": [
                "There is a physical blockage in the vas deferens preventing sperm exit",
                "The sperm are present but have 0% motility",
                "There is a failure of sperm production within the testes themselves",
                "The sperm lack the necessary enzymes to penetrate the egg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA) indicates a sperm production problem (spermatogenic failure), whereas Obstructive Azoospermia (OA) indicates that sperm are being produced but cannot exit due to a blockage."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, how does hyperinsulinemia directly exacerbate the hormonal imbalance in a PCOS client?",
            "options": [
                "It suppresses the pituitary gland's release of LH",
                "It stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce excess androgens",
                "It increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), lowering free testosterone",
                "It forces the conversion of testosterone into estrogen in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate the ovarian theca cells, leading to increased production of androgens (testosterone), which drives the clinical symptoms of PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which anatomical factor, discussed in Lesson 6, is a common cause of secondary infertility specifically following a previous Cesarean section?",
            "options": [
                "Endometrial polyps",
                "Bicornuate uterus",
                "Isthmocoele (C-section scar defect)",
                "Cervical incompetence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An isthmocoele is a reservoir or 'niche' that forms at the site of a previous C-section scar; it can collect old blood and mucus, creating a toxic environment for sperm and hindering embryo implantation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "If a client has experienced 'Unexplained Infertility' and failed multiple IVF transfers with high-grade embryos, which diagnostic test is most appropriate to evaluate the 'Window of Implantation'?",
            "options": [
                "Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)",
                "Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA)",
                "Post-Coital Test",
                "Semen Analysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ERA test biopsies the endometrium to determine if the 'window of implantation' is displaced (pre-receptive or post-receptive), allowing for personalized embryo transfer timing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "For a client with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and positive TPO antibodies, what is the generally recommended TSH threshold for those actively trying to conceive to minimize miscarriage risk?",
            "options": [
                "Under 5.0 mIU/L",
                "Under 4.0 mIU/L",
                "Under 2.5 mIU/L",
                "Exactly 0.1 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines generally recommend maintaining TSH levels below 2.5 mIU/L for women with thyroid antibodies who are attempting to conceive, as higher levels are associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 42-year-old client (AMA) has a DFI (DNA Fragmentation Index) report for her partner showing 35% fragmentation. Based on Lesson 4, what is the most evidence-based recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with standard IUI immediately",
                "Suggest the partner take high-dose antioxidants for 3 months and retest",
                "Advise that DNA fragmentation has no impact on IVF outcomes",
                "Recommend the client switch to donor eggs immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A DFI over 30% is associated with poor outcomes. Since sperm take approximately 74-90 days to develop, a 3-month protocol of targeted antioxidants (like Vitamin C, E, and Zinc) can significantly reduce fragmentation before the next ART cycle."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses 'Autoimmune Infertility.' What is the primary concern when a client tests positive for Antiphospholipid Antibodies (APS)?",
            "options": [
                "Failure of the egg to mature during the follicular phase",
                "Increased risk of blood clots in the placenta (thrombosis) leading to loss",
                "An inability of the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida",
                "Permanent damage to the fallopian tubes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune condition that increases the risk of blood clots; in pregnancy, this can cause placental thrombosis and infarction, leading to recurrent pregnancy loss."
