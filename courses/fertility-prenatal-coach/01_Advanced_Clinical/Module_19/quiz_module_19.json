            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress activates the HPA axis, where glucocorticoids (cortisol) suppress the GnRH pulse generator and increase the expression of RFRP-3, which acts as a brake on the reproductive system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have shown that CoQ10 supplementation (typically 600mg/day) can significantly improve clinical pregnancy rates and oocyte yield in women classified as poor ovarian responders."

            "question": "When interpreting advanced biomarkers (Lesson 6), what does a sustained rise in urinary Pregnanediol Glucuronide (PdG) indicate in a clinical context?",
            "options": [
                "That the LH surge is about to occur within 12 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PdG is the major urinary metabolite of progesterone. A sustained rise confirms that ovulation has occurred and that the corpus luteum is producing progesterone to support the luteal phase."
