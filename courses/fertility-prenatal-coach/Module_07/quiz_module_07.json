            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC is responsible for the 'top-down' regulation of emotions, allowing visualization to dampen the amygdala's fear response and lower systemic cortisol."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In somatic awareness practice, what is the primary purpose of 'Interoceptive Exposure' for a fertility client?",
            "options": [
                "To ignore physical pain during injections",
                "To increase the speed of the follicular phase",
                "To build tolerance for internal sensations and reduce the 'threat' response to reproductive signals",
                "To visualize the ovaries specifically in a golden light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive exposure helps clients reconnect with their bodies by observing sensations without judgment, reducing the autonomic nervous system's 'fight or flight' response to fertility-related signals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Luteal phase imagery focuses on receptivity, progesterone support, and the successful adhesion (implantation) of the embryo into a nutrient-rich lining."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A 2011 study by Domar et al. found that women who participated in a Mind-Body program (MBSR) prior to their second IVF cycle had a pregnancy rate of approximately ____ compared to 20% in the control group.",

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "A client states: 'If this cycle doesn't work, my body has completely failed me and I'll never be happy.' This is a classic example of which cognitive distortion?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polarized thinking involves seeing things in black-and-white terms (success vs. total failure), which increases psychological pressure and cortisol."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visualization targets the relaxation of the uterine muscle and the increase in blood flow (vascularization) to support the decidualization process necessary for pregnancy."

                "Push through the visualization to reach the end",
                "Ask the client to explain why they are crying immediately",

                "End the session and tell the client they are not ready for visualization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount; grounding techniques help the client regulate their nervous system and return to a state of safety before processing the emotion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional equivalence means the brain activates the same motor and sensory pathways during vivid visualization as it does during the actual experience, allowing for physiological shifts."
