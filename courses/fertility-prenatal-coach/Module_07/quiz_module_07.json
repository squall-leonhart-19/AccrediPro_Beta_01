            "question": "According to the 2022 meta-analysis by Levine et al. (updating the 2017 study), what is the estimated annual decline in sperm concentration globally among men since 1973?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 1.1%",
                "Approximately 0.5%",
                "Approximately 2.4%",
                "Approximately 5.0%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 2022 update confirmed that the rate of decline in sperm concentration has accelerated, showing an average decline of roughly 1.1% per year globally since 1973."

            "question": "A client presents with a 'normal' standard semen analysis (WHO 6th Ed. parameters) but has a history of recurrent pregnancy loss with his partner. Which advanced parameter is most likely to provide clinical insight?",
            "options": [
                "Sperm Morphology",
                "Sperm Concentration",
                "DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI)",
                "Semen pH level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard semen analysis measures quantity and movement, but DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) assesses the integrity of the genetic material; high DFI is strongly linked to recurrent pregnancy loss even when standard parameters are normal."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Research into the 'Prudent' or Mediterranean dietary pattern (high in fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables) has shown what specific impact on male fertility compared to the 'Western' diet?",
            "options": [
                "No significant difference in sperm quality",
                "Higher total sperm count and improved motility",
                "Increased sperm count but decreased morphology",
                "Decreased testosterone but increased motility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, including the 2019 Danish men study (n=2,935), consistently show that a Mediterranean/Prudent diet is associated with higher total sperm counts and better motility compared to diets high in processed meats and refined sugars."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Scrotal hyperthermia is a major risk factor for subfertility. An increase of how many degrees Celsius above the physiological norm is sufficient to significantly impair spermatogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 0.2°C",
                "1 - 2°C",
                "5 - 7°C",
                "10°C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The testes are physiologicaly 2-3°C cooler than core body temperature. An elevation of just 1-2°C above this norm can impair the enzymes required for DNA synthesis and increase oxidative stress in the germ cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which specific supplement has been shown in clinical trials to significantly improve sperm motility by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics and providing antioxidant protection?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol)",
                "Iron",
                "Calcium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Supplementation (typically 200-300mg) has been proven to improve sperm motility and concentration by reducing oxidative damage to the sperm membrane."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In male fertility coaching, why is Erectile Dysfunction (ED) considered a 'canary in the coal mine' for systemic health?",
            "options": [
                "It is always caused by low sperm count",
                "It is purely a psychological manifestation of fertility stress",
                "The penile arteries are smaller than coronary arteries, making ED an early indicator of cardiovascular disease",
                "It indicates a complete lack of testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ED is often a 'sentinel' symptom of endothelial dysfunction. Because penile arteries are 1-2mm while coronary arteries are 3-4mm, ED often precedes clinical cardiovascular disease by 3-5 years."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) such as phthalates and bisphenols (BPA) primarily impact male fertility through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "By acting as androgen antagonists or estrogen mimics",
                "By increasing the speed of spermatogenesis to 30 days",
                "By thickening the blood-testis barrier",
                "By increasing the alkalinity of the seminal fluid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EDCs interfere with the HPG axis by mimicking estrogen or blocking androgen receptors, leading to reduced testosterone production and impaired sperm development."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "When implementing lifestyle and nutritional changes for a male client, how long is the minimum 'pre-conception window' required to see the impact on a full new cycle of sperm?",
            "options": [
                "7 days",
                "28 days",
                "Approximately 72-90 days",
                "6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The full cycle of spermatogenesis and epididymal maturation takes approximately 72 to 90 days. Therefore, interventions must be sustained for at least 3 months to affect the quality of the ejaculated sperm."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client uses a laptop on his lap for 4 hours a day and uses a hot tub twice weekly. Based on the 2023 study data, what is the most likely physiological outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased testosterone due to heat exposure",
                "Increased sperm DNA fragmentation due to oxidative stress",
                "Improved sperm morphology through heat-shock proteins",
                "No impact as long as he takes a multivitamin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Laptops and hot tubs induce scrotal hyperthermia, which is a primary driver of oxidative stress, leading to increased DNA fragmentation and reduced sperm viability."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which fatty acid ratio in the sperm cell membrane is most critical for maintaining the fluidity and flexibility required for the acrosome reaction and fertilization?",
            "options": [
                "High Saturated Fat to Low Polyunsaturated Fat",
                "High Omega-6 to Low Omega-3",
                "High Omega-3 (DHA) to Low Omega-6",
                "High Trans-fat to Low Cis-fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sperm membranes require high levels of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an Omega-3 fatty acid, to remain fluid. A higher Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio is associated with better sperm parameters and fertilization success."
