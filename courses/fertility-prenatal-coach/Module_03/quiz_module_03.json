            "question": "Data from the Nurses' Health Study II (n=17,544) indicated that women with the highest 'Fertility Diet' scores, characterized by high monounsaturated fats and low-glycemic carbohydrates, experienced what percentage reduction in ovulatory infertility risk?",
            "options": [
                "24%",
                "48%",
                "66%",
                "82%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark Nurses' Health Study II found that adherence to a specific fertility diet pattern was associated with a 66% lower risk of ovulatory disorder infertility and a 27% lower risk of infertility from other causes."

            "question": "When supporting oocyte quality in clients over age 35, why is Ubiquinol preferred over Ubiquinone for mitochondrial support?",
            "options": [
                "It is the oxidized form and more stable in gastric acid.",
                "It has 3-4 times higher bioavailability and does not require the body to perform a conversion step.",
                "It specifically targets the zona pellucida rather than the mitochondria.",
                "It is the only form that can bypass the MTHFR enzyme bottleneck."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ubiquinol is the reduced, active form of CoQ10. As individuals age, the ability to convert Ubiquinone to Ubiquinol declines; therefore, the pre-converted form is more effective for supporting oocyte ATP production."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the context of spermatogenesis, which micronutrient is essential for the synthesis of selenoproteins that maintain the structural integrity of the sperm tail (flagellum)?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc",
                "Selenium",
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins (like GPx4) which are vital for the structural integrity of the sperm tail. Deficiency is often linked to poor sperm motility and morphological defects of the midpiece."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' influences fertility by producing which enzyme, which can deconjugate estrogens in the gut and lead to their reabsorption into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase",
                "Lipase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is produced by specific gut bacteria (the Estrobolome). High levels of this enzyme deconjugate estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation) rather than excreted, potentially leading to estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A clinical study on Omega-3 fatty acids and fertility found that women with higher blood levels of EPA and DHA were significantly more likely to conceive. What is the target Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio recommended in Module 3 to minimize systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "15:1",
                "10:1",
                "Under 4:1",
                "1:1 only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet often reaches ratios of 16:1 or higher, a ratio of 4:1 or lower is clinically associated with reduced inflammation and improved reproductive outcomes."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "For a client with a confirmed MTHFR C677T polymorphism, which form of folate is the most bioavailable and safest recommendation to prevent neural tube defects and manage homocysteine?",
            "options": [
                "Folic Acid (synthetic)",
                "Pteroylmonoglutamic acid",
                "5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)",
                "Folinic Acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "5-MTHF is the biologically active form of folate. Individuals with MTHFR polymorphisms have a reduced ability to convert synthetic folic acid into this active form, making 5-MTHF the superior choice."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "How does the 'Spinnbarkeit' effect relate to a client's hydration and electrolyte status?",
            "options": [
                "It refers to the thickness of the uterine lining.",
                "It describes the stretchability of cervical mucus, which requires optimal hydration and alkaline minerals to facilitate sperm transport.",
                "It is the process of the sperm penetrating the egg.",
                "It is a measure of vaginal pH acidity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spinnbarkeit refers to the elastic, egg-white consistency of fertile cervical mucus. This consistency is highly dependent on hydration and the presence of electrolytes like sodium and potassium to maintain its water-retaining structure."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In customizing nutrition for PCOS, the 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is used because:",
            "options": [
                "It is the ratio found in healthy follicular fluid and helps restore ovulatory function.",
                "It prevents the absorption of all dietary carbohydrates.",
                "It increases testosterone to promote follicle growth.",
                "It is the ratio required to trigger the LH surge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio mimics the physiological ratio found in plasma and follicular fluid. This specific ratio has been shown in multiple meta-analyses to be more effective than Myo-inositol alone for improving insulin sensitivity and ovulation in PCOS patients."

            "question": "Which of the following is a critical 'Quality Control' step when a coach evaluates a client's fish oil or Omega-3 supplement?",
            "options": [
                "Checking for a high ratio of saturated fat.",
                "Ensuring the product has been third-party tested for rancidity (peroxide value) and heavy metals.",
                "Making sure it contains at least 5000mg of Vitamin A.",
                "Confirming it is packaged in a clear plastic bottle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because polyunsaturated fats are highly unstable, third-party testing for oxidation (rancidity) and heavy metal contamination (mercury, lead) is vital for safety and efficacy in prenatal care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of Vitamin E and C has been shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce chronic pelvic pain and inflammatory markers in women with endometriosis by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS)."
