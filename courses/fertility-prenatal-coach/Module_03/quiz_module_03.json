            "question": "In the context of the HPO Axis, how does the frequency of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) pulses determine the type of gonadotropin released by the anterior pituitary?",
            "options": [
                "Low-frequency pulses favor LH release, while high-frequency pulses favor FSH release.",
                "High-frequency pulses favor LH release, while low-frequency pulses favor FSH release.",
                "GnRH frequency only affects the amplitude of hormone release, not the specific type.",
                "Pulse frequency is constant; only the total concentration of GnRH determines the output."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pituitary gland interprets GnRH pulse frequency as a signaling code. High-frequency pulses (every 60-90 minutes) stimulate the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), while lower frequency pulses (every 120+ minutes) favor Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)."

            "question": "Research on melatonin's role in the follicular microenvironment has demonstrated which of the following regarding oocyte quality?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin concentrations are significantly lower in follicular fluid than in peripheral blood.",
                "Melatonin acts as a pro-oxidant to trigger the rupture of the follicle during ovulation.",
                "Melatonin acts as a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting the oocyte from DNA damage during maturation.",
                "Supplementing with 10mg of melatonin is the standard clinical recommendation for all fertility patients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant. In the pre-ovulatory follicle, it neutralizes ROS produced during the metabolic activity of follicular growth, thereby protecting the delicate DNA of the maturing oocyte."

            "options": [
                "A single temperature reading that is 0.5°C higher than the previous day.",
                "Three consecutive temperatures that are at least 0.1°C higher than the average of the previous 10 days.",
                "Three consecutive temperatures that are all higher than the previous six, with the third being at least 0.2°C (0.4°F) above the coverline.",
                "Six consecutive temperatures that are higher than the previous three."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The standard rule for confirming ovulation via BBT is a sustained rise where three consecutive temperatures are higher than the preceding six 'low' temperatures, indicating the thermogenic effect of progesterone."

            "options": [
                "The day with the highest volume of mucus regardless of quality.",
                "The first day that clear, stretchy, or lubricative mucus appears.",
                "The last day of any fertile-quality (clear, stretchy, or lubricative) mucus characteristics.",
                "The day exactly 14 days before the expected start of the next period."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Peak Day' is the last day of fertile-type mucus (Type E). It is only identified retrospectively on the following day when the mucus transitions back to a dry or sticky (non-fertile) sensation."

            "question": "A 2021 clinical study noted that a Luteal Phase Defect (LPD) is most accurately diagnosed when the post-ovulatory phase is shorter than how many days?",
            "options": [
                "14 days",
                "12 days",
                "10 days",
                "8 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase of less than 10 days is clinically defined as a Luteal Phase Defect. This short duration often provides insufficient time for a fertilized embryo to implant and signal the corpus luteum to continue progesterone production."

            "question": "How does chronic blue light exposure after 9:00 PM specifically disrupt the female reproductive rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "It increases FSH levels prematurely, causing early ovulation.",
                "It suppresses pineal melatonin, which can lead to a 'blunted' or delayed LH surge and poor oocyte maturation.",
                "It directly inhibits the production of cervical mucus in the cervix.",
                "It causes an immediate drop in basal body temperature, making charting impossible."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light suppresses the pineal gland's production of melatonin. Since melatonin helps regulate the timing and robustness of the LH surge, chronic suppression can lead to irregular ovulation and reduced oocyte quality."

                "15 hours per week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While moderate exercise is beneficial, vigorous exercise (defined as >60 minutes of high-intensity activity) for more than 5 hours per week can lead to energy deficiency and HPO axis disruption in non-obese women."

            "options": [
                "Cortisol destroys the follicles within the ovary directly.",
                "Cortisol inhibits the secretion of Kisspeptin, the peptide required to trigger GnRH release.",
                "Cortisol increases estrogen levels to the point where the HPO axis shuts down.",
                "Cortisol causes the uterine lining to shed prematurely before ovulation can occur."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol acts as a metabolic signal that inhibits Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamus. Without Kisspeptin, GnRH is not released in the pulses required to stimulate FSH and LH, leading to a halt in the ovulatory cycle."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (32) presents with a BBT chart showing a slow, 'stair-step' rise after ovulation and a 9-day luteal phase with spotting starting on day 7. Which intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate referral for IVF due to ovarian failure.",
                "Implementing a protocol to support progesterone production, such as Vitex or B6, and assessing stress levels.",

                "Restricting caloric intake to reduce estrogen dominance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms (slow BBT rise, short luteal phase, and pre-menstrual spotting) are classic signs of progesterone insufficiency. Supporting the corpus luteum and reducing cortisol (which 'steals' pregnenolone from progesterone production) is the primary goal."

            "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between Cervical Mucus (CM) and Basal Body Temperature (BBT)?",
            "options": [
                "BBT rises 2-3 days before the appearance of fertile CM.",
                "The 'Peak Day' of CM typically occurs 1-2 days before or on the day of the thermal shift in BBT.",
                "CM and BBT always change on the exact same day.",
                "CM is controlled by progesterone, while BBT is controlled by estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen (which creates fertile CM) peaks just before ovulation. Progesterone (which raises BBT) rises after ovulation. Therefore, the 'Peak Day' of CM usually precedes the BBT rise by 24-48 hours."
