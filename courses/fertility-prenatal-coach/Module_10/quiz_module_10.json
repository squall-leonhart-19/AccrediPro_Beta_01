            "question": "By approximately which week of the second trimester does the fetus begin to develop the 'vernix caseosa,' and what is its primary physiological purpose?",
            "options": [
                "Week 14; to facilitate the first movements of the limbs.",
                "Week 20; to protect the delicate fetal skin from amniotic fluid exposure.",
                "Week 16; to provide a layer of insulation for thermoregulation.",
                "Week 24; to assist in the development of the fetal immune system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vernix caseosa typically appears around week 20. It is a waxy, biofilm-like substance that protects the fetal skin from chapping or abrasions caused by constant exposure to amniotic fluid."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Metabolism mapping for Gestational Diabetes (GDM) risk identifies the 24-28 week window as critical for screening. What is the primary hormonal driver of increased insulin resistance during this period?",
            "options": [
                "Decreased maternal progesterone levels.",
                "Excessive production of insulin by the fetal pancreas.",

                "A sudden drop in maternal thyroxine (T4) levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human placental lactogen (hPL), growth hormone, and cortisol are produced by the placenta to ensure glucose availability for the fetus, but they simultaneously increase maternal insulin resistance."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client in her 22nd week reports sharp, sudden pain in the lower abdomen when changing positions. Based on Module 10, Lesson 3, what is the most likely anatomical cause?",

                "Early Braxton Hicks contractions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Round ligament pain is common in the second trimester as the uterus grows and pulls on the ligaments that support it, often causing sharp, jabbing sensations during sudden movements."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When designing a prenatal strength program for the second trimester, why is it recommended to limit the time spent in a supine (flat on back) position?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the risk of Supine Hypotensive Syndrome caused by vena cava compression.",

                "To ensure the fetus remains in a head-down (vertex) position.",
                "To prevent the over-stretching of the pelvic floor muscles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The weight of the enlarging uterus can compress the inferior vena cava when lying supine, reducing blood flow to the heart and potentially causing dizziness for the mother and reduced oxygen for the fetus."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines discussed in Lesson 5, what is the recommended average caloric increase for a woman with a normal pre-pregnancy BMI during the second trimester?",

                "Approximately 500-600 kcal/day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a woman with a normal pre-pregnancy BMI, the energy requirement increases by approximately 340 calories per day during the second trimester to support fetal growth and maternal tissue expansion."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which specific nutrient is highlighted in Module 10 as being essential for fetal brain and retinal development during the 'brain growth spurt' that begins in the second trimester?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, is a major structural component of the brain and retina. Accumulation in the fetal brain accelerates significantly during the second and third trimesters."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maternal gut health and diet (specifically fiber and fermented foods) influence the microbial metabolites passed through the placenta, potentially shaping the early fetal environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The structures of the inner ear are well-developed by week 18, and by week 24, the fetus can consistently respond to sounds outside the womb, making it an ideal time for bonding techniques."

                "To increase lung capacity for labor.",
                "To stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.",
                "To coordinate the diaphragm and pelvic floor for functional stability.",
                "To manually turn a breech baby."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Core Breath involves the reflexive movement of the diaphragm and pelvic floor working together, which helps manage intra-abdominal pressure and protects the pelvic floor during pregnancy."
