            "question": "In the C.O.N.C.E.I.V.E. Framework™, the 'V' stands for Vitality & Nervous System Regulation. Why is this pillar considered foundational for clients undergoing ART?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for hormonal medications during IVF.",
                "Chronic sympathetic dominance can lead to vasoconstriction, potentially reducing blood flow to the uterine lining.",
                "It is the only pillar that directly increases the number of retrieved oocytes.",
                "It focuses exclusively on physical exercise to improve metabolic rate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'V' pillar focuses on shifting the client from a 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) state to a 'rest and digest' (parasympathetic) state. Research indicates that high stress and sympathetic dominance can cause vasoconstriction, which may impair uterine artery blood flow and endometrial receptivity."

            "question": "Clinical guidelines discussed in Lesson 2 suggest that for women attempting to conceive, the 'Optimal' range for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is generally tighter than standard lab ranges. What is the target TSH level for fertility optimization?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 mIU/L",
                "Below 2.5 mIU/L",
                "2.5 - 4.5 mIU/L",
                "Anywhere under 5.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard lab ranges often go up to 4.5 or 5.0 mIU/L, reproductive endocrinology guidelines (such as those from the American Thyroid Association) suggest that TSH should ideally be below 2.5 mIU/L to reduce the risk of miscarriage and optimize ovulation."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 emphasizes bioavailability in the 'N' (Nutrition) pillar. For a client with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, why is 5-MTHF preferred over synthetic folic acid?",
            "options": [
                "Synthetic folic acid is toxic to the liver in all doses.",
                "5-MTHF is cheaper and more stable for long-term storage.",
                "Individuals with this polymorphism have a reduced ability to convert synthetic folic acid into the active folate needed for DNA methylation.",
                "Synthetic folic acid inhibits the absorption of Vitamin B12."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR enzyme is responsible for converting folate into its active form (5-methyltetrahydrofolate). Those with the C677T variant have reduced enzyme activity (up to 70% reduction in homozygotes), making pre-methylated folate (5-MTHF) more bioavailable and effective."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the 'C' Pillar (Metabolic Detoxification), Phase II conjugation in the liver is critical for estrogen clearance. Which specific pathway is responsible for neutralizing 4-OH and 16-OH estrogen metabolites to prevent DNA damage?",
            "options": [
                "Sulfation",
                "Acetylation",
                "Methylation via COMT enzyme",
                "Glucuronidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) enzyme facilitates the methylation of catechol estrogens (like 4-OH estrone), converting them into stable, non-toxic methoxyestrogens. This prevents the formation of DNA-damaging quinones."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Reproductive Immunology (Lesson 5) explores the role of Uterine Natural Killer (uNK) cells. What is the primary difference between peripheral NK cells and uNK cells regarding pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "Peripheral NK cells are harmful, while uNK cells are essential for remodeling spiral arteries to support the placenta.",
                "uNK cells are only present during the follicular phase.",
                "Peripheral NK cells are responsible for egg fertilization.",
                "There is no difference; they are the same cells found in different locations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unlike peripheral NK cells which are cytotoxic (killing infected/cancerous cells), uNK cells are specialized immune cells that facilitate trophoblast invasion and the remodeling of uterine spiral arteries, which is crucial for establishing a healthy blood supply to the fetus."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Male Factor' lesson, a DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) score is a better predictor of fertility than a standard semen analysis. At what DFI threshold is a significant decline in natural conception and IUI success typically observed?",
            "options": [
                "> 5%",
                "> 15%",
                "> 30%",
                "> 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A DFI of >30% is clinically considered high fragmentation. Research shows that men with a DFI above 30% have significantly lower pregnancy rates and higher miscarriage rates, even if their standard parameters (count/motility) appear normal."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is discussed as a primary intervention for oocyte quality. For a client over 35 undergoing IVF, what is the evidence-based recommendation for dosage and timing?",
            "options": [
                "100mg daily, starting on the day of egg retrieval.",
                "200mg daily for 2 weeks prior to the cycle.",
                "600mg+ daily (as Ubiquinol), started at least 3 months prior to stimulation to cover the full folliculogenesis cycle.",
                "CoQ10 should be avoided during IVF as it interferes with gonadotropins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oocytes require significant mitochondrial energy (ATP) for meiosis. Since the maturation of a primordial follicle takes approximately 90-120 days, CoQ10 supplementation (ideally 600mg+ in divided doses) should begin 3 months prior to the IVF cycle to impact egg quality."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' is a subset of the gut microbiome that influences systemic estrogen levels. How does a dysbiotic estrobolome contribute to conditions like endometriosis?",
            "options": [
                "It produces excess progesterone, causing hormonal imbalance.",
                "It produces high levels of beta-glucuronidase, which deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream.",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary fats.",
                "It triggers the immediate destruction of the uterine lining."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bacteria in a dysbiotic gut can produce the enzyme beta-glucuronidase. This enzyme 'un-clips' the glucuronic acid from estrogen that the liver was trying to excrete, leading to the reabsorption of active estrogen and contributing to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "From a Professional Excellence and Ethics standpoint (Lesson 8), what is the correct protocol if a client presents with 'red flag' symptoms such as sharp, one-sided pelvic pain and a positive pregnancy test?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest an increase in magnesium to relax the pelvic muscles.",
                "Wait 48 hours to see if the pain subsides before taking action.",
                "Instruct the client to seek immediate medical evaluation (ER or OBGYN) to rule out an ectopic pregnancy.",
                "Advise the client to perform a vaginal steam to improve circulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize 'red flags' that fall outside their scope of practice. Sharp, unilateral pain in early pregnancy is a classic sign of an ectopic pregnancy, which is a medical emergency. Immediate referral is the only ethical and safe action."

            "question": "A case study in the module features 'Client M,' who has failed two IVF transfers despite having 'euploid' (chromosomally normal) embryos. Which 'Advanced Deep Dive' investigation is most appropriate next?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the dose of folic acid to 5000mcg.",
                "Testing for Chronic Endometritis (via biopsy) and assessing the vaginal microbiome for Lactobacillus dominance.",
                "Switching from IVF to IUI to 'try a more natural approach'.",
                "Focusing exclusively on weight loss to lower BMI."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When euploid embryos fail to implant, the focus shifts to the 'soil' (the endometrium). Chronic endometritis (asymptomatic inflammation) and a lack of protective Lactobacillus in the uterine/vaginal microbiome are leading causes of implantation failure and are key components of the Reproductive Immunology/Microbiome deep dive."
