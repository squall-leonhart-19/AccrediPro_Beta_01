            "question": "In the context of the HPO axis, how does high-frequency GnRH pulsatility specifically affect gonadotropin release?",
            "options": [
                "It selectively favors the secretion of LH over FSH.",
                "It inhibits the production of both LH and FSH via negative feedback.",
                "It selectively favors the secretion of FSH over LH.",
                "It triggers the immediate conversion of androgens to estrogens in the theca cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-frequency GnRH pulses favor LH secretion, while low-frequency pulses favor FSH secretion. This shift is critical during the late follicular phase to trigger the LH surge."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "When implementing therapeutic micronutrient protocols for egg quality, what is the clinically recommended dosage of CoQ10 (Ubiquinol) supported by research to improve mitochondrial function?",
            "options": [
                "50–100 mg per day",
                "200–300 mg per day",
                "400–600 mg per day",
                "1,000–1,200 mg per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies, including those focused on IVF outcomes and mitochondrial ATP production in oocytes, typically utilize dosages in the 400–600 mg range for therapeutic efficacy."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated beta-glucuronidase levels on a functional stool test. What is the primary physiological consequence regarding her estrogen metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibition of Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes.",
                "Deconjugation of estrogen in the gut, leading to its reabsorption into circulation.",
                "Rapid excretion of estrogen through the biliary pathway.",
                "Upregulation of the 2-OH pathway, reducing breast cancer risk."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by the estrobolome that 'un-couples' conjugated estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted, contributing to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When analyzing a DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) panel, what does a high level of THF and THE (Cortisol/Cortisone metabolites) relative to low Free Cortisol usually indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison's Disease).",
                "Rapid cortisol clearance (often seen in obesity or hyperthyroidism).",
                "A failure of the 11b-HSD2 enzyme in the kidneys.",
                "Chronic HPA axis suppression and low total production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High metabolites with low free cortisol suggest the body is producing plenty of cortisol, but it is being cleared or metabolized very quickly, common in cases of high inflammation, obesity, or hyperthyroidism."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the latest research on PCOS and Insulin Resistance, what is the optimal physiological ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol for restoring ovulation and improving oocyte quality?",

                "100:1 ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 Myo to D-chiro ratio is the physiological plasma ratio. Deviations from this (specifically too much D-chiro in the ovaries) can impair egg quality and FSH signaling."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Endometriosis is increasingly classified as an immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Which cytokine is most significantly elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with stage III/IV endometriosis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TNF-alpha is a hallmark pro-inflammatory cytokine in endometriosis that promotes adhesion formation, pain, and creates a hostile environment for the embryo."

                "Zinc and Selenium require 90 days to reach therapeutic levels in the testes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because a new 'crop' of sperm takes roughly 2.5 to 3 months to mature, any lifestyle or supplement interventions will not be fully reflected in a semen analysis until this cycle is complete."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In a client with PCOS, a fasting insulin level of 18 µIU/mL is found. How should a Functional Fertility Coach interpret this result?",
            "options": [
                "Normal, as it falls within the standard laboratory reference range (typically <25 µIU/mL).",
                "Low, indicating a need for increased carbohydrate intake to stimulate the pancreas.",
                "High, as optimal functional levels for fertility are typically between 2–5 µIU/mL.",
                "Irrelevant, as only Hemoglobin A1c matters for fertility outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 18 µIU/mL may be 'normal' on a lab report, it indicates significant insulin resistance in a functional context. Optimal fasting insulin for fertility and hormonal balance is generally <5 or 6 µIU/mL."

            "id": "q11_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies have compared NAC (at 1.2g to 1.8g daily) to Metformin, showing comparable improvements in insulin sensitivity and ovulation rates with fewer side effects."
