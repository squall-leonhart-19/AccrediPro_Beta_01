            "question": "According to fetal positioning research, which position is considered the 'gold standard' for facilitating a smoother descent through the pelvic inlet?",
            "options": [
                "Right Occiput Posterior (ROP)",
                "Left Occiput Anterior (LOA)",
                "Right Mentum Anterior (RMA)",
                "Left Occiput Transverse (LOT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Left Occiput Anterior (LOA) is considered the optimal position as the fetal back is angled toward the mother's front-left, allowing the smallest diameter of the head to navigate the pelvis efficiently."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a blood pressure reading of 145/92 mmHg at 36 weeks. Per ACOG clinical guidelines, what is the protocol for confirming a diagnosis of gestational hypertension?",
            "options": [
                "A single reading above 140/90 mmHg is sufficient for diagnosis",
                "Two readings above 140/90 mmHg taken at least 4 hours apart",
                "Two readings above 130/80 mmHg taken 24 hours apart",
                "A single reading above 160/110 mmHg with proteinuria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACOG defines gestational hypertension as a systolic BP of 140+ or diastolic of 90+ on two occasions at least 4 hours apart in a previously normotensive woman after 20 weeks gestation."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A 2011 study published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology found that consuming 6 date fruits (Phoenix dactylifera) daily for the final 4 weeks of pregnancy resulted in which outcome?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% reduction in the risk of gestational diabetes",
                "Significant increase in birth weight by an average of 200g",
                "Higher mean cervical dilatation upon admission and shorter first stage of labor",
                "Complete elimination of the need for postpartum oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study (Al-Kuran et al., 2011) showed that the date-consuming group had significantly higher cervical dilatation (3.52 cm vs 2.02 cm) and a significantly higher rate of spontaneous labor (96% vs 79%)."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When 'Birth Mapping' with a client, what is the primary distinction between a traditional 'Birth Plan' and a 'Birth Map'?",
            "options": [
                "A Birth Map is a legal document that the hospital must sign",
                "A Birth Map focuses exclusively on home birth logistics",
                "A Birth Map uses a 'Pathways' approach, planning for various contingencies (e.g., Path A, Path B, Path C)",
                "A Birth Map focuses only on the postpartum period and ignores the labor process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Birth Mapping is a flexible framework that prepares the client for different scenarios (spontaneous labor, induction, or cesarean), ensuring they remain empowered regardless of the clinical path the birth takes."

            "id": "q11_5",

                "Multiparity women (second or subsequent births)",
                "Women over the age of 40",
                "Primiparous women (first-time mothers)",
                "Women planning an elective cesarean"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cochrane reviews indicate that perineal massage most significantly reduces the incidence of episiotomy and third/fourth-degree tears in primiparous women."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In the 'Fear-Tension-Pain' cycle proposed by Dr. Grantly Dick-Read, how does fear directly contribute to increased labor pain?",
            "options": [
                "Fear causes the release of oxytocin, which over-stimulates the uterus",
                "Fear triggers the sympathetic nervous system, causing blood to divert from the uterus and tightening the cervical muscles",
                "Fear reduces the mother's heart rate, leading to fetal distress",
                "Fear has no physiological effect; it is purely psychological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fear triggers the 'fight or flight' response, releasing catecholamines that cause the circular muscles of the lower uterus to tighten against the longitudinal muscles of the fundus, creating physiological tension and pain."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "According to the MANA Stats study (n=18,700+), what is the approximate transfer rate from planned home births to the hospital for primiparous (first-time) mothers?",

                "Over 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the overall transfer rate for all planned home births is lower, first-time mothers have a higher transfer rate, typically cited between 23% and 37%, usually for non-emergent reasons like 'failure to progress.'"

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "During the 'Golden Hour' immediately following birth, what physiological benefit does skin-to-skin contact provide to the neonate?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate closure of the fontanelles",
                "Stabilization of blood glucose levels and thermoregulation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) regulates the infant's temperature, heart rate, and breathing, while also reducing the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which helps stabilize blood glucose."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client is concerned about 'low milk supply' before birth. As a coach, you explain that 'Colostrogenesis' begins in the third trimester. At what point is colostrum typically present in the breasts?",
            "options": [
                "Only after the placenta is delivered",
                "Starting between 16 and 22 weeks gestation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage I Lactogenesis (colostrogenesis) begins mid-pregnancy (16–22 weeks), meaning most women have colostrum available immediately upon birth, regardless of when their 'mature' milk comes in."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Upper right quadrant pain (liver involvement) and a 'thunderclap' headache are classic signs of severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome and require immediate emergency assessment."
