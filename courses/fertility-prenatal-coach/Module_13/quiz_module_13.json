            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme is responsible for the methylation of catechol estrogens, converting potentially DNA-damaging metabolites into stable, excretable forms."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of the HPO Axis, what is the primary function of Kisspeptin neurons located in the arcuate nucleus?",
            "options": [
                "Directly stimulating the ovaries to produce progesterone",
                "Acting as the 'master switch' to trigger the pulsatile release of GnRH",
                "Inhibiting the production of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Converting testosterone into estrogen via aromatization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kisspeptin is the primary upstream regulator of the HPO axis, signaling the hypothalamus to release Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) in a pulsatile manner."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to research on mitochondrial energetics, why is Ubiquinol preferred over Ubiquinone for clients over the age of 35?",
            "options": [
                "It is the oxidized form and more stable in stomach acid",
                "It is cheaper to manufacture and more accessible",
                "It is the pre-reduced, bioactive form with superior bioavailability and absorption",
                "It specifically targets the mitochondria in the liver rather than the oocytes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ubiquinol is the reduced (active antioxidant) form of CoQ10. As we age, the body's ability to convert Ubiquinone to Ubiquinol declines, making direct Ubiquinol supplementation more effective for oocyte ATP production."

                "1 ug/mL on the day of peak cervical mucus",
                "Over 5 ug/mL for multiple days during the mid-luteal window",
                "Exactly 10 ng/mL in a serum blood draw",
                "Any presence of the hormone regardless of the concentration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PdG is the urinary metabolite of progesterone. For a 'successful' ovulation confirmation, levels should ideally stay above 5 ug/mL for at least 3-4 days during the implantation window (days 7-10 post-peak)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are endocrine disruptors that interfere with Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs), which are essential for normal metabolic function and the production of reproductive hormones."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Oxytocin-Cortisol' relationship described in the Psychobiology of Intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "Oxytocin and Cortisol rise together to promote arousal",
                "High Cortisol levels stimulate the production of Oxytocin",
                "Oxytocin acts as a biological buffer, inhibiting the HPA axis and lowering Cortisol levels",
                "There is no measurable relationship between these two hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin has an inverse relationship with cortisol; it down-regulates the amygdala and inhibits the stress response, creating a physiological environment conducive to conception."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness and visualization reduce the firing of the Amygdala (the brain's fear center), which in turn reduces the inhibitory signals sent to the HPO axis."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Total Toxic Burden' found that cumulative exposure to EDCs (Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals) can reduce the probability of pregnancy by what percentage per cycle (fecundability index)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5-10%",
                "Approximately 17-29%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane (found in cruciferous vegetables) is a potent inducer of the Nrf2 pathway, which triggers the body’s internal production of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "According to the Professional Scope of Practice in Lesson 8, if a client’s lab results show a TSH of 4.5 mIU/L during the preconception phase, what is the coach's correct course of action?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe 50mcg of Levothyroxine immediately",
                "Tell the client they are infertile and cannot conceive",
                "Suggest lifestyle/nutritional support for thyroid health and refer to a physician for medical management",
                "Ignore the result as it is within the 'normal' lab reference range"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a TSH of 4.5 may be in 'normal' range for the general population, it is high for preconception (ideal is <2.5). A coach provides lifestyle support but MUST refer to a medical professional for diagnosis and medication."
