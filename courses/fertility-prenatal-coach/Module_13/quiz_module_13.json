            "question": "During the process of uterine involution, at what point should the fundus typically no longer be palpable abdominally as it returns to the true pelvis?",
            "options": [
                "24 hours post-delivery",
                "3 to 5 days post-delivery",
                "10 to 14 days post-delivery",
                "6 weeks post-delivery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Uterine involution is a rapid process where the uterus decreases in weight from approximately 1000g to 60g. By 10 to 14 days postpartum, the uterus should have descended into the true pelvis and should no longer be palpable above the symphysis pubis."

            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding lactation energetics suggests that exclusive breastfeeding requires an average additional energy intake of approximately how many calories per day?",
            "options": [
                "200-300 kcal",
                "450-500 kcal",
                "700-800 kcal",
                "1,000 kcal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Producing breast milk is metabolically demanding. While the body utilizes some fat stores accumulated during pregnancy, an additional intake of 450-500 calories per day is generally required to support milk production without depleting maternal nutrient stores."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "How do 'Baby Blues' clinically differ from Postpartum Depression (PPD) regarding timing and duration?",
            "options": [
                "Baby Blues start at 3 months; PPD starts immediately.",
                "Baby Blues involve psychosis; PPD involves only mild sadness.",
                "Baby Blues typically resolve within 10-14 days; PPD symptoms persist longer and are more severe.",
                "There is no clinical difference; they are interchangeable terms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Baby Blues affect up to 80% of new mothers and typically peak around day 4-5, resolving by day 14. If depressive symptoms persist beyond two weeks or interfere with the ability to care for the infant, it is categorized as PPD, affecting approximately 1 in 7 women."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "When assessing for Diastasis Recti Abdominis (DRA) in a postpartum client, what measurement is generally considered the threshold for clinical significance (the 'inter-recti distance')?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 0.5 cm",
                "Greater than 1.0 cm",
                "Greater than 2.0 cm (roughly 2 finger-widths)",
                "Greater than 5.0 cm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While some separation is normal in 100% of pregnancies by the third trimester, a persistent gap of more than 2.0 cm at 6-12 weeks postpartum is clinically defined as Diastasis Recti, requiring specific core rehabilitation to manage intra-abdominal pressure."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which specific component of breast milk acts as a prebiotic to selectively stimulate the growth of Bifidobacterium infantis in the newborn's gut?",
            "options": [
                "Casein proteins",
                "Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs)",
                "Lactose",
                "Medium-chain triglycerides"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HMOs are the third most abundant solid component in breast milk. They are indigestible by the infant but serve as a critical food source for beneficial bacteria like B. infantis, which helps program the infant's immune system."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Research into postpartum sleep architecture shows that 'fragmented sleep' (waking every 2 hours) has a similar cognitive impact to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking two cups of coffee",
                "4 hours of total sleep deprivation",
                "A blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% to 0.10%",
                "Increased REM cycle efficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have demonstrated that fragmented sleep, even if the total hours add up to 7 or 8, results in cognitive impairment, mood instability, and reduced reaction times comparable to significant sleep deprivation or mild alcohol intoxication."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Immediately following the delivery of the placenta, which hormonal shift is most responsible for the potential 'mood crash' observed in the first 72 hours?",
            "options": [
                "A 90-95% drop in Progesterone and Estrogen",
                "A sudden spike in Testosterone",
                "A decrease in Oxytocin",
                "A total cessation of Cortisol production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The placenta is a massive endocrine organ. Once delivered, levels of Estrogen and Progesterone plummet to pre-pregnancy levels within days. This 'hormonal withdrawal' is a primary physiological trigger for the Baby Blues and mood dysregulation."

            "question": "In the 'AccrediPro Coaching Framework,' what is the primary role of the coach during the 6-week 'waiting period' before a client is cleared for exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to lose 'baby weight'.",

                "Facilitating restorative rest, nutritional density, and nervous system regulation.",
                "Adjusting the client's thyroid medication dosage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach's scope during the early postpartum period (0-6 weeks) focuses on 'The Three Rs': Rest, Replenishment, and Regulation. Coaches should never diagnose medical conditions or prescribe intense exercise before medical clearance."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client presents 4 months postpartum with extreme fatigue, hair loss, and sensitivity to cold. While these can be 'normal' new parent symptoms, which condition should the coach suggest they screen for with their doctor?",

                "Gestational Diabetes (post-resolution)",
                "Postpartum Thyroiditis",

                "Vitamin D Toxicity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postpartum Thyroiditis affects about 5-10% of women. It often involves a phase of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. Symptoms like cold intolerance and significant hair loss are hallmarks that warrant a TSH/T4 blood panel."

            "question": "To support collagen synthesis and perineal/surgical tissue repair, which nutrient triad is most critical for a postpartum client?",

                "Calcium, Vitamin D, and K2",
                "Vitamin C, Zinc, and Amino Acids (Proline/Glycine)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a cofactor for collagen hydroxylation, Zinc is essential for cell division and protein synthesis, and amino acids like Proline and Glycine provide the structural building blocks for repairing skin and connective tissues after birth."
