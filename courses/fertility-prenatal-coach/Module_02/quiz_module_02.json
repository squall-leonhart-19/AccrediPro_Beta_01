        {
            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "In advanced biomarker testing, what is considered the 'functional optimal' range for fasting homocysteine to minimize the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)?",
            "options": ["< 15.0 µmol/L", "< 12.0 µmol/L", "< 7.0 µmol/L", "< 3.0 µmol/L"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While many labs list up to 15.0 µmol/L as normal, functional fertility standards seek levels below 7.0 µmol/L to ensure optimal methylation and reduce the risk of micro-thrombosis in the developing placenta."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client presents with an Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) level of 6.8 ng/mL and an Antral Follicle Count (AFC) of 24. These markers are most suggestive of which condition?",
            "options": ["Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)", "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)", "Optimal Ovarian Reserve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An AMH level above 3.5–4.0 ng/mL and a high AFC (typically >12-15 per ovary) are classic indicators of the polycystic morphology associated with PCOS, rather than simply 'high' fertility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the American Thyroid Association and the Endocrine Society, what is the recommended TSH upper limit for women in the first trimester of pregnancy and during the preconception period?",
            "options": ["4.5 mIU/L", "3.5 mIU/L", "2.5 mIU/L", "1.0 mIU/L"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To reduce the risk of miscarriage and support fetal neurological development, the clinical consensus for preconception and the first trimester is a TSH below 2.5 mIU/L."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) hypothesis describes how chronic stress can lead to progesterone deficiency. What is the primary mechanism?",
            "options": ["Cortisol destroys progesterone molecules in the bloodstream", "The body prioritizes the production of cortisol over sex hormones under stress", "High cortisol increases the rate of progesterone excretion in urine", "Stress prevents the ovaries from responding to LH"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pregnenolone is a precursor to both cortisol and progesterone. Under chronic stress, the biochemical pathway is diverted toward cortisol production to ensure survival, often at the expense of progesterone (the 'pro-gestation' hormone)."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which specific MTHFR polymorphism is most strongly associated with a 60-70% reduction in enzyme efficiency, requiring a strict avoidance of synthetic folic acid?",
            "options": ["A1298C Heterozygous", "C677T Homozygous", "C677T Heterozygous", "A1298C Homozygous"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The C677T homozygous genotype (two copies of the variant) causes the most significant reduction in the ability to convert folic acid into the usable 5-MTHF form, significantly impacting fertility and homocysteine regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In functional blood chemistry analysis, what is the target 'optimal' level for Vitamin D (25-OH) to support follicular maturation and IVF success rates?",
            "options": ["20 - 30 ng/mL", "30 - 40 ng/mL", "45 - 65 ng/mL", "> 100 ng/mL"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Vitamin D levels between 45-65 ng/mL are associated with better clinical pregnancy rates and improved follicular fluid environment compared to the standard 'sufficient' range of 30 ng/mL."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to the Rotterdam Criteria, how many of the three specific requirements must be met for a formal PCOS diagnosis?",
            "options": ["All three", "At least two", "Only one if it is hyperandrogenism", "At least two, but one must be polycystic ovaries"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rotterdam Criteria require at least two of the following: 1. Oligo- or anovulation, 2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and 3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which structural barrier is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, often causing a 'frozen pelvis' and significant inflammatory interference with egg quality?",
            "options": ["Uterine Fibroids", "Endometrial Polyps", "Endometriosis", "Adenomyosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis creates a pro-inflammatory environment that can damage oocytes, interfere with tubal motility, and hinder implantation, even when the fallopian tubes are not fully blocked."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A Day 3 FSH level of 14 IU/L combined with an Estradiol level of 85 pg/mL most likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Optimal fertility and high ovarian reserve", "A suppressed FSH due to high estrogen, masking DOR", "The early stages of Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An FSH > 10-12 IU/L on Day 3 is a classic indicator of DOR. While estrogen can sometimes suppress FSH, a level of 14 IU/L is already elevated, suggesting the pituitary is working harder to stimulate the ovaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of creating a 'Physiological Baseline Report' in the P.R.I.M.E. methodology?",
            "options": ["To provide a medical diagnosis for the client's infertility", "To identify sub-optimal 'gaps' between lab 'normal' and functional 'optimal' ranges", "To replace the need for an Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE)", "To prescribe high-dose pharmaceutical interventions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Baseline Report is a coaching tool used to identify functional imbalances (the 'gaps') that may be hindering conception, allowing for targeted nutritional and lifestyle interventions to optimize the physiological terrain."
