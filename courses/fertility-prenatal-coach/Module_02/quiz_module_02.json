            "question": "In the context of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis, what specifically triggers the 'LH Surge' required for ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "A rapid drop in progesterone levels during the mid-luteal phase",
                "Sustained high levels of estradiol (exceeding 200 pg/mL for ~48 hours) creating positive feedback",
                "A surge in Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) from the adrenal cortex",
                "Low-frequency GnRH pulses favoring FSH production over LH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While most of the cycle operates on negative feedback, ovulation is triggered by positive feedback where high estradiol levels for a sustained period cause the pituitary to release a massive surge of LH."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client's functional lab report shows high levels of 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone (16-OH) relative to 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH). According to Lesson 2, what is the primary clinical concern regarding this ratio?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of androgenic alopecia due to DHT conversion",
                "Impaired Phase II methylation via the COMT enzyme",
                "Excessive proliferative activity in estrogen-sensitive tissues and potential 'estrogen dominance' symptoms",
                "Insufficient endometrial thickening due to low estrogenic potency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "16-OH is a highly potent, proliferative estrogen metabolite. A low 2:16 ratio is associated with stronger estrogenic signaling and has been linked in studies to increased risks of estrogen-sensitive conditions."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which specific mechanism explains why hyperinsulinemia often leads to hyperandrogenism in female fertility clients?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin inhibits the production of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) in the liver, increasing free testosterone",
                "Insulin converts progesterone directly into DHEA in the adrenal glands",
                "High insulin levels block the FSH receptors on the granulosa cells",
                "Insulin stimulates the conversion of T4 to Reverse T3, slowing metabolic clearance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Insulin suppresses hepatic SHBG production. When SHBG is low, more testosterone circulates in its 'free' or unbound state, leading to androgenic symptoms and ovulatory disruption."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "To confirm successful ovulation and adequate corpus luteum function, when should 'Day 21' Progesterone testing ideally be performed for a client with a 32-day cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Exactly on Day 21 of the cycle, regardless of cycle length",
                "On Day 3 of the following menstrual cycle",
                "7 days after the predicted or detected day of ovulation (approximately Day 25)",
                "Immediately upon the first sign of fertile cervical mucus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone peaks mid-luteal phase, roughly 7 days post-ovulation. For a 32-day cycle, ovulation likely occurs around Day 18, making Day 25 the optimal testing window."

            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'The Metabolic Spark,' what is the recommended 'functional' TSH range for clients actively seeking to conceive, as opposed to standard clinical ranges?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 to 1.0 mIU/L",
                "0.5 to 2.5 mIU/L",
                "3.0 to 5.5 mIU/L",
                "Any value under 10.0 mIU/L is considered optimal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While lab reference ranges often go up to 4.5 or 5.0 mIU/L, functional fertility standards and many endocrine guidelines suggest keeping TSH below 2.5 mIU/L to reduce miscarriage risk and optimize ovulation."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol-Progesterone Shift) describes a process where chronic stress prioritizes the production of cortisol over sex hormones. Which enzyme's activity is often bypassed or reduced during this shift?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "5-alpha reductase",
                "17,20-lyase",
                "Thyroid peroxidase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under high stress, the body favors the pathway toward cortisol, often at the expense of the 17,20-lyase reaction which is required to move precursors toward DHEA and subsequent sex hormones."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Regarding male hormonal optimization, a 2022 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 7 found that which of the following had the most significant impact on reducing sperm DNA fragmentation?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 7 days a week",
                "Targeted antioxidant therapy (e.g., CoQ10, Vitamin E, and Zinc)",
                "Increasing soy protein intake to lower endogenous estrogen",
                "Exogenous testosterone replacement therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antioxidant therapy is a cornerstone of male fertility because it directly combats oxidative stress, which is the primary driver of sperm DNA fragmentation and morphological defects."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client presents with a Basal Body Temperature (BBT) chart showing a slow 'stair-step' rise after ovulation and a luteal phase duration of only 9 days. This pattern most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "High insulin sensitivity",
                "Luteal Phase Defect (LPD) or Progesterone deficiency",
                "Excessive 2-OH estrogen metabolites",
                "Optimal HPO axis orchestration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase shorter than 10 days and a slow temperature rise are classic indicators of Luteal Phase Defect, suggesting the corpus luteum is not producing sufficient progesterone to maintain the endometrium."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which nutrient is a critical cofactor for the COMT enzyme in Phase II estrogen detoxification, helping to convert hydroxyestrogens into methoxyestrogens?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and Magnesium",
                "Iron",
                "Vitamin K2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) requires Magnesium as a cofactor and SAMe as a methyl donor to successfully detoxify estrogen metabolites."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In a male client, an elevated LH level accompanied by a low Testosterone level (Primary Hypogonadism) suggests that the issue is located in:",
            "options": [
                "The Pituitary gland (failure to signal)",
                "The Hypothalamus (low GnRH)",
                "The Testes (Leydig cell failure)",
                "The Adrenal glands (low DHEA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If LH is high, the brain is signaling correctly, but the testes are failing to respond by producing testosterone. This indicates primary testicular failure rather than a signaling issue in the brain."
