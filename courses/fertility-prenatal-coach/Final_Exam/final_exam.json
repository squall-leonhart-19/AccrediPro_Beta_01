            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Cleanse & Prepare' phase focuses on metabolic health and reducing the body's toxic burden (endocrine disruptors) to create a hospitable environment for an embryo."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a 32-day cycle. According to Cycle Awareness (M4) protocols, when is her 'Peak' fertility window most likely to occur?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a 32-day cycle, ovulation typically occurs around day 18 (Cycle length minus 14 days for the luteal phase). The peak window is the 2-3 days leading up to and including ovulation."
