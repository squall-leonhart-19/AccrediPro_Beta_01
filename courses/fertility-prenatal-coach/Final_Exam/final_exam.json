                "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) as indicated by high follicular activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMH levels below 1.0 ng/mL are generally considered a marker for Diminished Ovarian Reserve. While AMH is a strong indicator of the quantity of the remaining oocyte pool, it is not a definitive measure of egg quality, which is more closely linked to age and oxidative stress levels (Inflammatory Inhibition)."

            "options": [
                "It indicates optimal insulin sensitivity for conception",
                "It suggests insulin resistance, which can disrupt ovulation and increase androgen production",
                "It confirms the presence of Type 1 Diabetes",
                "It is only relevant if the client is already pregnant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score above 1.9-2.0 indicates insulin resistance. In fertility, this is significant as hyperinsulinemia can stimulate the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, interfering with follicle development and ovulation."

                "Increasing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to boost testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High DNA fragmentation is often caused by oxidative stress. While count and motility may look normal, fragmented DNA reduces fertilization rates and increases miscarriage risk. Antioxidant therapy and lifestyle changes to reduce oxidative stress are the primary interventions."
