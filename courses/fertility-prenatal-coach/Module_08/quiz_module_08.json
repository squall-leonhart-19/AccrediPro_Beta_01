            "question": "Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is most clinically indicated in which of the following scenarios?",
            "options": [
                "Unexplained infertility with normal semen parameters",
                "Severe male factor infertility with low sperm count or motility",
                "Advanced maternal age (over 40) with high egg reserve",
                "History of multiple miscarriages with natural conception"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ICSI is specifically designed to overcome male factor infertility by injecting a single viable sperm directly into the oocyte, bypassing the need for the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer layers independently."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "During the stimulation phase of an IVF cycle, a coach should monitor for signs of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS). Which dietary intervention is evidence-based for reducing OHSS severity?",
            "options": [
                "Low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet to maintain energy",
                "Water-only fasting for 12 hours post-retrieval",
                "High-protein intake combined with electrolyte-rich fluids",
                "Elimination of all sodium to prevent fluid retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High protein intake (specifically albumin) and electrolyte-rich fluids help maintain osmotic pressure and keep fluid within the vascular space, reducing the risk of third-spacing associated with OHSS."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In the AccrediPro P.R.I.M.E. Approach for embryo transfer preparation, what does the 'M' represent?",
            "options": [
                "Medication Adherence",
                "Mindset & Modulation",
                "Metabolic Optimization",
                "Microbiome Balancing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'M' stands for Mindset & Modulation, focusing on reducing the sympathetic nervous system's 'fight or flight' response to optimize the uterine environment for implantation."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A 2021 study published in 'Fertility and Sterility' indicated that what percentage of patients experience clinical levels of anxiety or depression following a failed IVF cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Over 60%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 30-40% of patients meet the criteria for clinical anxiety or depression after a failed cycle, highlighting the need for intensive coaching support during this period."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "When supporting a client through a donor egg journey, how should a coach explain the role of the gestational parent's epigenetics?",
            "options": [
                "The gestational parent has no biological influence on the child's development.",
                "The gestational parent's uterine fluid contains microRNAs that can influence which donor genes are expressed.",
                "Epigenetics only apply to the donor's lifestyle choices prior to egg retrieval.",
                "The child will only share DNA with the egg donor and the sperm provider."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recent research into 'maternal-fetal communication' shows that microRNAs in the uterine fluid can influence the gene expression (epigenetics) of the embryo, allowing the gestational parent to have a biological impact on the child's development."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "What is the primary reason coaches advise clients to wait for a beta-HCG blood test rather than using home pregnancy tests (HPTs) 5 days after a trigger shot?",
            "options": [
                "Home tests are only 50% accurate during IVF.",
                "The HCG trigger shot can remain in the system for up to 10-14 days, causing a false positive.",
                "HPTs cannot detect the specific type of HCG produced in IVF pregnancies.",
                "Progesterone suppositories interfere with the chemical reaction in home tests."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The synthetic HCG used in 'trigger shots' to mature eggs can linger in the bloodstream, leading to a false positive on a home test if taken too early."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "According to a meta-analysis of lifestyle interventions in ART, a Mediterranean-style diet was associated with what increase in clinical pregnancy rates?",
            "options": [
                "No significant increase",
                "Approximately 10% increase",
                "Up to 40% higher clinical pregnancy and live birth rates",
                "85% increase in twin pregnancies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as Karayiannis et al.) have found that high adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with up to a 40% higher chance of clinical pregnancy compared to low adherence."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Maria' (41) is preparing for her first IVF cycle. Her doctor noted low ovarian reserve (AMH 0.6). Which supplement has the strongest evidence for improving oocyte mitochondrial function if started 90 days prior to retrieval?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C (500mg)",
                "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinol) 600mg",
                "Iron (65mg)",
                "St. John's Wort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 (specifically in the Ubiquinol form) has been shown in clinical trials to improve mitochondrial function in oocytes, which is critical for women with diminished ovarian reserve or advanced maternal age."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is an ethical consideration a coach should be prepared to discuss regarding 'Social Egg Freezing'?",
            "options": [
                "The mandatory requirement to use the eggs within 2 years.",
                "The 'false sense of security' and the reality that one retrieval may not guarantee a future live birth.",
                "The illegality of transporting frozen eggs across state lines.",
                "The requirement to have a partner's consent to freeze oocytes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A major ethical and coaching concern is the 'marketing' of egg freezing as a total insurance policy; coaches must help clients understand the statistical probability of success based on the number of eggs frozen and age at retrieval."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "During the 'Two-Week Wait' (TWW), clients often report symptoms like bloating, breast tenderness, and fatigue. How should a coach interpret these?",
            "options": [
                "They are definitive signs of successful implantation.",
                "They are usually side effects of supplemental progesterone and the recent retrieval procedure.",
                "They indicate that the body is rejecting the embryo.",
                "They are signs that the client needs to increase their exercise intensity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most 'early pregnancy symptoms' during an ART cycle are actually side effects of the high doses of progesterone (suppositories or injections) required to support the luteal phase, making it impossible to symptom-spot accurately."
