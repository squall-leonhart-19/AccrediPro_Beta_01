            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 30-35%",
                "Approximately 48-52%",
                "Approximately 70-75%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (Domar et al.) indicates that roughly 50% of women experiencing infertility meet the clinical criteria for depression or anxiety, levels similar to those facing life-threatening illnesses."

                "Permanently damaging the ovarian reserve",
                "Eliminating the production of progesterone entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the 'wear and tear' on the body from chronic stress, which disrupts the HPG axis, leading to altered gonadotropin secretion and potential ovulatory dysfunction."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client states, 'If this IVF cycle doesn't work, I will never be a mother and my life will be meaningless.' Which cognitive distortion is this an example of?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Catastrophizing involves jumping to the worst possible conclusion, while 'fortune telling' involves predicting a negative future outcome as an established fact."

                "To manifest a positive pregnancy test result"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scheduled worry time is a cognitive-behavioral technique that helps clients gain a sense of control by designating a specific 15-20 minute window for anxiety, thereby reducing 'hypervigilance' throughout the rest of the day."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported, which is common in early pregnancy loss or failed fertility treatments."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Buffer Technique involves using a trusted friend or a specific communication channel (like an email thread) to manage information flow, protecting the client from intrusive questions or the burden of repeating painful updates."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity Foreclosure in this context happens when the 'infertility patient' role consumes all other aspects of the individual's identity (career, hobbies, partner role), leading to a crisis of self when treatments fail or end."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches should validate the physiological reality of the anxiety while providing 'containment' strategies that limit the compulsive behaviors (checking) without shaming the client."
