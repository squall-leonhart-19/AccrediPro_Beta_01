            "question": "In Advanced Detoxification (Phase II), which pathway is specifically responsible for the conjugation of estrogens and catecholamines, requiring Magnesium and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as primary cofactors?",
            "options": [
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Methylation",
                "Sulfation",
                "Glutathione Conjugation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylation (via the COMT enzyme) is the Phase II pathway that neutralizes hydroxyestrogens. It is highly dependent on SAMe as a methyl donor and Magnesium as a catalyst."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. What is the primary mechanism by which an imbalanced estrobolome contributes to 'Estrogen Dominance'?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of progesterone in the colon",
                "Decreased absorption of dietary phytoestrogens",
                "Excessive production of beta-glucuronidase, which de-conjugates estrogen for reabsorption",
                "Direct synthesis of estradiol by Firmicutes bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid. When this happens in the gut, the 'bound' estrogen is freed and reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than being excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Hyperinsulinemia is a primary driver of ovulatory dysfunction. According to Lesson 3, how does high insulin directly increase the bioavailability of testosterone in women?",
            "options": [
                "By stimulating the adrenal glands to produce DHEA",
                "By inhibiting the liver's production of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)",
                "By increasing the conversion of progesterone to testosterone in the ovaries",
                "By blocking the androgen receptors in skin and hair follicles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin suppresses the hepatic synthesis of SHBG. Lower levels of SHBG mean less testosterone is bound, leading to higher levels of 'free' (biologically active) testosterone."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "The '90-Day Oocyte Window' is a cornerstone of the CONCEIVE plan. Why is this specific timeframe biologically significant for mitochondrial health?",
            "options": [
                "It is the time it takes for a primordial follicle to be recruited",
                "It represents the final stage of follicular maturation where the oocyte undergoes massive mitochondrial replication and ATP demand",
                "It is the lifespan of a corpus luteum",
                "It is the time required for the endometrial lining to fully reset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the 90 days prior to ovulation, the oocyte grows significantly and its mitochondrial count increases to roughly 200,000, making this window the most critical time for antioxidant and nutrient intervention."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In the HPA-HPO axis crosstalk, how does chronic 'survival mode' (high cortisol) typically manifest in the luteal phase?",
            "options": [
                "Increased progesterone sensitivity",
                "Shortened luteal phase due to suppressed LH pulsatility and 'Pregnenolone Steal'",
                "Early ovulation (Day 10 or earlier)",
                "Excessive cervical mucus production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress activates the HPA axis, which can inhibit GnRH and LH pulses. Additionally, the body may prioritize cortisol production over progesterone (Pregnenolone Steal), leading to luteal phase defects."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights that a standard spermiogram can miss 'Male Factor' issues in 15% of 'unexplained' cases. What advanced test is recommended for clients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)?",
            "options": [
                "Sperm Concentration Test",
                "Sperm DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI)",
                "Post-Coital Test",
                "Sperm pH Analysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DNA Fragmentation (DFI) measures the integrity of the paternal genetic material. High fragmentation (>25-30%) is strongly linked to miscarriage and failed fertilization even when count and motility look normal."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Regarding Micronutrient Synergies, why is the 'Folate vs. Folic Acid' distinction critical for clients with the MTHFR polymorphism?",
            "options": [
                "Folic acid is toxic to the liver in all doses",
                "MTHFR mutations prevent the conversion of synthetic folic acid into the active 5-MTHF, potentially leading to unmetabolized folic acid in the blood",
                "Folic acid causes the downregulation of estrogen receptors",
                "Active folate is only found in animal products"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR enzyme converts folate into its active form. Those with certain variants have reduced enzymatic activity (up to 70% reduction), making 5-MTHF (methylfolate) a more bioavailable and effective choice than synthetic folic acid."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Client 'Case Study A' presents with a HOMA-IR of 3.2 and an LH:FSH ratio of 3:1. What should be the primary focus of the first 4 weeks of her 12-week CONCEIVE plan?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive detoxification and juice fasting",

                "Immediate referral for IVF"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR >1.9 indicates insulin resistance, and a 3:1 LH:FSH ratio suggests PCOS. Stabilizing blood sugar is the foundational step to lowering androgens and restoring ovulation."

            "question": "Which specific nutrient synergy is most effective for improving sperm morphology and reducing oxidative stress (ROS) in the male partner?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-carnitine provides energy for sperm motility, while Zinc and Selenium are essential for testosterone synthesis and protecting the sperm membrane from oxidative damage."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 supports mitochondrial ATP production in the oocyte, which is essential for the energy-intensive process of chromosomal division (meiosis), thereby reducing aneuploidy."
