            "question": "During the 'luteal-placental shift,' at approximately which week of gestation does the placenta typically take over the primary production of progesterone from the corpus luteum?",
            "options": [
                "Weeks 4-6",
                "Weeks 7-10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition from the corpus luteum to the placenta for progesterone production, known as the luteal-placental shift, occurs between weeks 7 and 10. A failure in this transition is a common focus in early pregnancy monitoring."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B6 (10-25mg every 8 hours) and Ginger (up to 1000mg/day) are evidence-based, first-line recommendations for managing NVP before moving to pharmacological options like Doxylamine."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NIPT measures fragments of fetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood (cfDNA) and is highly accurate for screening Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 starting at 10 weeks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maternal hyperthermia, especially in the first trimester during organogenesis, is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, which is why hot tubs and excessive high-intensity exercise in heat are cautioned against."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early pregnancy fatigue is primarily driven by the massive surge in Progesterone (which has a sedative effect) and the significant metabolic energy required to develop the placenta and increase blood volume by 40-50%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Talk Test' is a subjective measure of intensity. If a client can maintain a conversation, she is likely at a moderate intensity, ensuring she is not over-exerting or diverting too much oxygen away from the developing fetus."
