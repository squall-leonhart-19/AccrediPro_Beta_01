            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), what is the primary mechanism by which Phthalates impact male reproductive health?",
            "options": [
                "They act as direct mutagens on the DNA sequence of sperm cells.",
                "They inhibit fetal androgen synthesis, leading to 'Phthalate Syndrome'.",
                "They increase the production of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH).",
                "They promote the over-calcification of the testicular basement membrane."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known anti-androgens that interfere with testosterone production during critical developmental windows, often resulting in reduced anogenital distance and impaired testicular function, collectively known as Phthalate Syndrome."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is a concept used in trauma-informed care to describe the state where a person is neither hyper-aroused (anxious/panicked) nor hypo-aroused (numb/dissociated), allowing for therapeutic progress."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Several studies, including those by Domar et al., have shown that mind-body programs can nearly double pregnancy rates in women struggling with infertility by reducing the inhibitory effects of chronic stress on the HPA axis."

                "It is the total weight of environmental toxins in the adipose tissue.",
                "It is the cumulative 'wear and tear' on the body caused by chronic stress response activation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief occurs when a loss (like early miscarriage or failed IVF) isn't recognized by society as a 'standard' loss, leaving the individual without traditional support structures."

            "question": "When implementing a 'Low-Tox' lifestyle (Lesson 8), why is it recommended to avoid heating food in plastic containers, even those labeled 'BPA-Free'?",
            "options": [
                "BPA-free plastics often use replacement chemicals like BPS or BPF, which have similar endocrine-disrupting effects.",
                "Plastic containers reflect microwave radiation, causing uneven cooking.",
                "The plastic absorbs the nutrients from the food when heated.",
                "Microplastics only leach into cold liquids, not hot food."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Many BPA substitutes (BPS/BPF) have been found to be equally potent endocrine disruptors. Heat accelerates the leaching of these chemicals into food regardless of the 'BPA-free' label."

                "To increase the heart rate to improve blood flow to the uterus.",
                "To stimulate the sympathetic nervous system's 'fight or flight' response.",
                "To activate the parasympathetic nervous system and return the client to their Window of Tolerance.",
                "To help the client ignore their physical sensations entirely."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques (like the 5-4-3-2-1 method) help pull a client out of a trauma response by engaging the senses and activating the parasympathetic nervous system (the 'rest and digest' state)."
