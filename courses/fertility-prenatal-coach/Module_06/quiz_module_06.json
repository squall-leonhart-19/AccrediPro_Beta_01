            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 explains the biological connection where cortisol inhibits Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), which in turn reduces the LH/FSH surge necessary for ovulation and healthy libido."

                "Because it invalidates the female partner's emotional experience by jumping to solutions instead of providing emotional presence",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that a 20-second hug is the 'tipping point' for the brain to release oxytocin, which actively lowers the heart rate and reduces circulating cortisol levels."
