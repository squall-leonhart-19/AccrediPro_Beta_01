            "question": "During the 'implantation window,' what specific immunological shift is required for successful embryo apposition and invasion?",
            "options": [
                "A permanent shift to a Th2-dominant anti-inflammatory state",
                "A transient pro-inflammatory Th1 response followed by a shift to Th2 dominance",
                "Complete suppression of Natural Killer (NK) cell activity in the endometrium",
                "A systemic increase in C-Reactive Protein (CRP) to trigger uterine contractions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Successful implantation requires a 'Goldilocks' inflammatory environment. A brief Th1 pro-inflammatory phase is necessary for the embryo to adhere and invade the lining, which must then transition to a Th2-dominant state to prevent maternal rejection."

            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding Oxidative Stress (OS) found that men with high levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) were how many times more likely to have significant sperm DNA fragmentation?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times",
                "2.2 times",
                "4.0 times",
                "8.5 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high ROS levels correlate strongly with sperm DNA fragmentation; men with excessive oxidative stress are approximately 4 times more likely to show DNA damage, significantly impacting blastocyst development."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which nutritional intervention has been shown in clinical trials to increase the probability of clinical pregnancy and live birth by up to 65-68% in women undergoing IVF?",
            "options": [
                "Strict Ketogenic Diet",

                "Vegan Diet with Soy Supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mediterranean diet, rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, reduces systemic inflammation. A landmark 2018 study (Karayiannis et al.) showed a 65-68% higher success rate in IVF for those with high adherence."

            "question": "In clients with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, why is it critical to address Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) antibodies even if TSH levels are within the 'normal' clinical range?",
            "options": [
                "TPO antibodies directly attack the developing oocyte in the follicle",
                "The presence of TPO antibodies doubles the risk of miscarriage even in euthyroid women",
                "TPO antibodies prevent the absorption of prenatal vitamins in the gut",
                "Antibodies increase the risk of gestational diabetes by 40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Even if TSH is normal (euthyroid), the presence of TPO antibodies indicates an active autoimmune inflammatory process that is associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of pregnancy loss."

            "question": "When recommending Omega-3 supplementation for egg quality, what is the primary mechanism by which EPA and DHA improve reproductive outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "By thickening the endometrial lining through estrogenic mimicry",
                "By increasing the production of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)",
                "By reducing systemic inflammation and improving mitochondrial function in oocytes",
                "By stimulating the pituitary gland to release more Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) inhibit the NF-κB pathway, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines while supporting mitochondrial health, which is essential for the high energy demands of oocyte maturation."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A client presents with unexplained infertility and chronic bloating. How can 'Leaky Gut' (Increased Intestinal Permeability) contribute to her fertility struggles?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the direct leakage of stomach acid into the fallopian tubes",
                "It allows Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream, triggering systemic inflammation",
                "It leads to the overproduction of progesterone, causing hormonal imbalance",
                "It prevents the liver from processing excess testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the intestinal barrier is compromised, LPS (endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria) enter systemic circulation. This triggers a chronic inflammatory response that can interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Chronic stress triggers the release of cortisol, which in the short term is anti-inflammatory. Why does chronic cortisol elevation eventually lead to a PRO-inflammatory state?",
            "options": [
                "The body runs out of cholesterol to make cortisol",
                "Glucocorticoid receptor resistance develops, allowing NF-κB to run unchecked",
                "Cortisol eventually turns into estrogen, causing dominance",
                "Chronic stress causes the thyroid to shut down entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exposure to cortisol causes immune cells to become less sensitive to its inhibitory signals (glucocorticoid resistance). This results in an unregulated inflammatory response and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

            "question": "According to the protocol for reducing pelvic inflammation in Endometriosis, which antioxidant has been shown in a 3-month study to reduce endometrioma size and pelvic pain?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C (500mg/day)",
                "N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) at 1,800mg/day",

                "Folic Acid (800mcg/day)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A study by Porpora et al. demonstrated that 600mg of NAC taken three times daily (1,800mg total) for three months led to a significant reduction in endometrioma mean diameter and a decrease in chronic pelvic pain."

            "question": "Which laboratory marker is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing low-grade systemic inflammation in a preconception screening?",
            "options": [
                "Total White Blood Cell Count",
                "High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "Serum Glucose",
                "Hemoglobin A1c"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While WBC and A1c provide health insights, hs-CRP is the most sensitive marker for low-grade systemic inflammation, which can affect ovulation and implantation even when other markers appear normal."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are vital for maternal-fetal tolerance. Which nutrient is most critical for the induction and function of these 'peacekeeper' cells?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Calcium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in the immune system by promoting the differentiation of Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are essential for preventing the mother's immune system from attacking the 'foreign' DNA of the embryo."
