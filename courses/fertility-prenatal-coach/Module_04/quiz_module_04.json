            "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for the thermogenic effect that causes the Basal Body Temperature (BBT) rise observed in the luteal phase?",
            "options": [
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Progesterone",
                "Estradiol",
                "Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation, acts on the hypothalamus to raise the body's set-point temperature by approximately 0.5°F to 1.0°F."
        },

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the '3 over 6' rule used in symptothermal charting, what is required to confirm a thermal shift has occurred?",
            "options": [
                "Three consecutive temperatures that are all at least 0.2°F higher than the highest of the previous six temperatures.",
                "Three temperatures that are higher than the average of the entire previous cycle.",
                "Six consecutive temperatures that are higher than the three temperatures recorded during menses.",
                "A single temperature spike of at least 0.5°F sustained for 48 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The '3 over 6' rule requires three consecutive daily temperatures to be higher than the preceding six 'cool' temperatures, with the third high temp ideally being 0.4°F higher than the cover line (though 0.2°F is the standard minimum for the first two)."

            "question": "A client charts the following: Monday (Egg White), Tuesday (Watery), Wednesday (Egg White), Thursday (Creamy/Sticky). Which day is the 'Peak Day'?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Peak Day' is defined as the last day of highly fertile cervical mucus (clear, stretchy, or lubricative) before the drying-up transition, regardless of which day had the 'most' volume."

            "options": [
                "Soft, High, Open, Wet",
                "Solid, Hard, Outward, White",

                "Slight, Horizontal, Obstructed, Waxy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "During the fertile window, the cervix becomes Soft (like an earlobe), High (harder to reach), Open (the os dilates), and Wet (due to fertile mucus)."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A 2021 study on the 'Fertile Window' found that the probability of conception is highest (approx. 25-30%) when intercourse occurs on which day(s)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that O-2 and O-1 are the most fertile days because they allow sperm to be present in the fallopian tubes when the egg is released."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 regarding charting irregularities, a luteal phase consistently shorter than how many days is identified as a potential 'Luteal Phase Defect' (LPD)?",
            "options": [
                "14 days",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase of 9 days or fewer is clinically considered short and may indicate insufficient progesterone to support embryo implantation."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "What is the primary limitation of 'Calendar-Method' period tracking apps for clients seeking to conceive?",
            "options": [
                "They require too much manual data entry.",
                "They rely on historical averages rather than real-time physiological biomarkers.",
                "They cannot be used by women with 28-day cycles.",
                "They are more expensive than symptothermal kits."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calendar apps assume the future will look like the past; however, ovulation can vary cycle-to-cycle due to stress or illness, making real-time signs (CMM/BBT) more accurate."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When implementing the C.O.N.C.E.I.V.E. Charting method, what does the 'E' in the framework represent to ensure data integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen levels only",
                "Evening measurements",

                "Exercise intensity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'E' stands for External Factors/Exceptions, which must be noted because things like alcohol consumption or travel can cause artificial BBT spikes."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "If a client's chart shows a 'Sawtooth' pattern with erratic high and low temperatures and no clear biphasic shift, what is the most likely interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperthyroidism",
                "Anovulation (lack of ovulation)",
                "Pregnancy",
                "Early menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A lack of a clear, sustained biphasic temperature shift usually indicates that ovulation did not occur, resulting in no progesterone rise to stabilize the temperature."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Secondary fertility signs, such as 'Mittelschmerz,' refer to which physiological sensation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mittelschmerz is German for 'middle pain' and refers to the localized pelvic pain some women feel during the rupture of the follicle during ovulation."
