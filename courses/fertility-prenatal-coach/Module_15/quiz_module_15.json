                "Because generalist coaches are legally prohibited from working with prenatal clients",
                "To avoid having to learn about different reproductive conditions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Niching down allows a practitioner to speak directly to a specific audience's pain points, positioning them as an expert and allowing for premium pricing compared to a generalist."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leveraging your existing network (Warm Market) is the fastest way to build initial momentum because the 'Know, Like, and Trust' factor is already established."
