            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "During the 'Cleanse & Prepare' phase (L1), which specific Phase II detoxification pathway is most critical for the conjugation and subsequent excretion of endogenous estrogens to prevent estrogen dominance?",
            "options": [
                "Sulfation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Acetylation",
                "Amino Acid Conjugation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation, facilitated by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, is the primary pathway for neutralizing estrogen. If this or the 'estrobolome' (gut microbiome) is compromised, estrogen can be deconjugated and reabsorbed."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the context of the HPO Axis (L2), which neuropeptide acts as the primary 'gatekeeper' by integrating metabolic and external signals to trigger the release of GnRH?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin",
                "Ghrelin",
                "Kisspeptin",
                "Somatostatin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kisspeptin, produced in the arcuate nucleus, is the master regulator that signals GnRH neurons to pulse. It is highly sensitive to energy availability and stress (cortisol)."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Mitochondrial health is vital for oocyte quality (L3). Based on the 90-day follicular maturation window, when is the MOST critical time to implement high-dose Ubiquinol (CoQ10) supplementation?",
            "options": [
                "Only during the 5 days of menstruation",
                "During the 14 days of the luteal phase",
                "At least 3-4 months prior to planned conception",
                "Immediately after a positive pregnancy test"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oocytes require approximately 90-120 days to mature from the primordial stage. Supplementing during this entire window supports mitochondrial ATP production during the energy-intensive process of meiosis."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "When interpreting complex cycles (L4), a 'PDG' (Pregnanediol Glucuronide) rise that occurs but fails to stay elevated for at least 3 consecutive days suggests which clinical possibility?",
            "options": [
                "Successful fertilization",
                "Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD) or weak ovulation",
                "Anovulatory bleeding",
                "Early onset of menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A transient rise in PDG (progesterone metabolite) indicates that while ovulation may have occurred, the corpus luteum is not producing sufficient progesterone to sustain the uterine lining, often termed a 'weak' ovulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Environmental Epigenetics (L5), a 2021 meta-analysis suggests that high maternal exposure to phthalates can lead to which specific outcome in male offspring?",
            "options": [
                "Increased birth weight",
                "Shortened Anogenital Distance (AGD)",
                "Advanced skeletal age",
                "Increased testosterone production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are anti-androgenic. High exposure in utero is statistically linked to shortened AGD in males, a marker of reduced androgen signaling during the critical fetal development window."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroimmunology (L6), how does chronic sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation specifically impair the 'Implantation Window'?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing cervical mucus elasticity",
                "By shifting the immune system toward a Th1-dominant (pro-inflammatory) state",
                "By lowering blood glucose levels",
                "By stimulating excessive oxytocin release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol drive a Th1-dominant immune response. Successful implantation requires a shift toward Th2 (anti-inflammatory) dominance to prevent the maternal immune system from attacking the embryo."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "For a client with PCOS (L7), why is addressing Hyperinsulinemia considered a primary 'upstream' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin directly increases SHBG levels",
                "Insulin inhibits the pituitary from releasing LH",
                "Insulin stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce excess androgens",
                "Insulin prevents the conversion of testosterone to estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH on ovarian theca cells to drive androgen production and simultaneously suppresses SHBG in the liver, leading to higher levels of 'free' bioavailable testosterone."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Which physiological mechanism is the hallmark of Endometriosis-related infertility according to the 'Complex Case Integration' (L7)?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of follicular stimulating hormone",

                "Excessive progesterone production in the follicular phase",
                "Hypoprolactinemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis creates a hostile, pro-inflammatory environment. Elevated cytokines (like TNF-alpha and IL-6) in the peritoneal and follicular fluid can impair sperm motility and damage oocyte quality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In the CONCEIVE Coaching Protocol (L8), the 'I' stands for 'Integration.' What is the primary focus of this stage?",
            "options": [
                "Integrating high-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Integrating medical data with lifestyle adjustments and emotional resilience",
                "Integrating a vegan diet protocol",
                "Integrating multiple supplement brands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves synthesizing the clinical data (biomarkers, labs) with the client's unique lifestyle, psychological state, and goals to create a cohesive, sustainable action plan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client presents with a 35-day cycle, a slow BBT rise, and significant 'spotting' 4 days before her period. Using the CONCEIVE protocol, which area should the coach prioritize first?",
            "options": [
                "Intense detox with a 7-day water fast",
                "Immediate referral for IVF",
                "Optimizing the HPO axis through stress reduction and Progesterone support",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to boost energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A slow BBT rise and pre-menstrual spotting are classic signs of low progesterone/luteal phase deficiency. Addressing the HPO axis and supporting the corpus luteum (via nutrition/stress management) is the priority."
