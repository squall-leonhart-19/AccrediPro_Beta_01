                "The coach is spending more than 20% of their time on marketing strategies.",
                "The business's revenue is entirely dependent on the coach's personal billable hours.",
                "The coach has hired a virtual assistant to manage clinical scheduling.",
                "The coach is utilizing automated webinars to generate leads."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Technician Trap' occurs when the business owner is the sole provider of the service, meaning the business cannot scale because revenue is capped by the owner's personal time and physical presence."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio is the industry gold standard for scaling. It indicates that for every $1 spent on marketing, the business generates $3 in lifetime value, allowing for reinvestment and profit."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Churn rate is 4/100 = 4%. Lifespan is calculated as 1 / Churn Rate (1 / 0.04 = 25 months). Understanding this helps predict long-term revenue."

                "Licensing is more expensive for the coach to set up.",
