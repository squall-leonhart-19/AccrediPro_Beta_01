            "question": "In the transition from Practitioner to CEO (L1), what is the primary shift required regarding 'Low-Value' vs. 'High-Value' tasks?",
            "options": [
                "Performing all clinical assessments personally to ensure quality control.",
                "Delegating administrative and repetitive tasks to focus on strategic growth and system design.",
                "Increasing the number of 1-on-1 hours to maximize immediate cash flow.",
                "Moving all client communication to automated chatbots without human oversight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CEO mindset requires moving from 'doing' the work to 'designing' the systems. High-value tasks for a leader include strategy, partnership building, and system optimization, while clinical delivery is eventually delegated."

            "question": "According to the Module 35 data on scaling, what is the primary advantage of a 'Cohort-Based' group coaching model over an 'Evergreen' model?",

                "Lower initial marketing costs.",
                "Reduced need for instructor presence.",
                "Higher completion rates due to peer accountability and social dynamics.",
                "Lower price points for the end consumer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cohort models leverage social proof and synchronous learning, which typically results in significantly higher engagement and completion rates (often 70-90%) compared to self-paced evergreen courses."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "B2B clients prioritize business outcomes. Positioning nutrition services as a competitive advantage that increases enrollment or improves staff wellness/retention is more effective than clinical data alone."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SOPs allow a practice to scale while maintaining a 'signature' level of care. Without documented protocols, client outcomes become dependent on individual coach talent rather than the practice's system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy scaling ratio is 3:1 (LTV:CAC). If it costs $500 to acquire a customer, that customer should bring in at least $1,500 in revenue to cover fulfillment, overhead, and profit."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Churn rate (the rate at which clients leave) can negate even the most successful marketing. If churn is high, the business must constantly spend to replace lost revenue, making sustainable growth impossible."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional valuations are typically based on a multiple of EBITDA (usually 2x to 5x for small to mid-sized practices), as this represents the true's profitability and cash flow."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Scaling' and 'Growing' as defined in Module 35?",
            "options": [
                "Growing means adding revenue; Scaling means adding revenue at a faster rate than costs.",

                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Growth often implies adding resources at the same rate as revenue (linear). Scaling is the ability to increase revenue exponentially while only increasing costs incrementally (non-linear)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licensing is a 'one-to-many' strategy. By selling the rights to use their proven system or curriculum, the practitioner generates passive revenue and impact without providing the direct service themselves."
