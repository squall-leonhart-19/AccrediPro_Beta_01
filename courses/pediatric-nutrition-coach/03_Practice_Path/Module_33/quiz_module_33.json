                "Teaching the family how to read nutrition labels for carbohydrate counting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adjusting medication dosages (like insulin) or prescribing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for a clinical condition is strictly reserved for licensed medical professionals or Registered Dietitians, falling outside the coaching scope of practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "The laws of the state/country where the client is physically located at the time of service.",
                "Federal law always supersedes local laws in telehealth, rendering local jurisdiction irrelevant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the majority of legal frameworks (including the US and EU), the 'nexus' of service is the location of the client. Coaches must comply with the regulations and licensing laws of the jurisdiction where the client resides."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "A coach wants to use a testimonial from a parent stating that a specific supplement 'cured their child's ADHD.' Why does this pose a significant legal risk under FTC and FDA guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "It is a 'Disease Claim' rather than a 'Structure/Function Claim,' which is prohibited for non-drugs.",
                "Testimonials are illegal in pediatric nutrition coaching regardless of the content.",
                "The coach did not include the child's full medical record in the advertisement.",
                "ADHD is not a condition recognized by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The FDA and FTC prohibit making 'Disease Claims' (claiming a product cures, treats, or prevents a disease) for supplements or coaching services. Coaches should only use 'Structure/Function' claims, such as 'supports cognitive focus.'"

            "id": "q33_5",
            "question": "What is the legal distinction between 'Consent' and 'Assent' in a pediatric coaching agreement?",
            "options": [
                "Consent is given by the coach; Assent is given by the parent.",
                "Consent is the legal agreement by the parent; Assent is the child's informal agreement to participate.",
                "Consent is required for children over 18; Assent is required for those under 18.",
                "There is no legal distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in pediatric law."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legally, a minor cannot provide 'Informed Consent.' The parent/guardian provides the legal consent, while the child provides 'Assent,' which demonstrates their willingness to participate and respects their autonomy."

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "During a session, a coach notices unexplained bruising and the child mentions they haven't eaten in two days because they were 'being bad.' What is the coach's legal obligation as a 'Mandatory Reporter'?",

                "Wait until the next session to see if the situation improves before taking action.",
                "Confront the parents immediately and demand an explanation.",
                "Report the suspicion to the appropriate child protective services agency immediately.",
                "Document the findings but do not report, as coaching is protected by client-coach privilege."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In most jurisdictions, health and wellness professionals are mandatory reporters. They are legally required to report suspected abuse or neglect to authorities. Coaching does not provide 'privilege' that supersedes child safety laws."

        {
            "id": "q33_7",
            "question": "According to professional liability standards, why is it critical for a coach to maintain 'Referral Triggers' in their practice?",

                "To satisfy the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",
                "To mitigate risk by ensuring clients with clinical needs are directed to appropriate medical professionals.",
                "To ensure the coach does not have to work more than 20 hours per week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Referral triggers define specific symptoms or conditions (e.g., sudden weight loss, disordered eating patterns) that require the coach to refer the client to a doctor, thereby protecting the coach from liability and ensuring client safety."

        {
            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "For operational compliance, how long should a Pediatric Nutrition Coach generally retain client records after the coaching relationship has ended?",

                "Records should be destroyed immediately to comply with GDPR-K.",
                "Until the child reaches the age of majority (usually 18) plus the state's statute of limitations period.",
                "Exactly 5 years, regardless of the child's age."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because the statute of limitations for a minor often doesn't begin until they reach adulthood, records should typically be kept until the child reaches the age of majority plus several additional years (often 3-7 years) depending on local law."

            "id": "q33_9",

                "The claim must be accompanied by a disclaimer that explains the level of scientific evidence.",
                "The claim must be endorsed by a celebrity to be considered 'Qualified.'",
                "Qualified health claims are only allowed for prescription medications, not nutrition services."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Qualified health claims are supported by some scientific evidence but do not meet the 'Significant Scientific Agreement' standard. Therefore, they must be qualified by a disclaimer to prevent misleading consumers."

            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "A 2022 review of pediatric health litigation found that the most common cause of professional liability claims against non-licensed practitioners was:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Failure to refer is a primary source of liability. If a coach continues to treat a child whose symptoms require medical intervention, they can be held liable for negligence or practicing medicine without a license."
