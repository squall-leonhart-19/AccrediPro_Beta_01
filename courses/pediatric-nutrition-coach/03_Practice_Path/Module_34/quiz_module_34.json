            "question": "According to Lesson 1 on Architecting High-Impact Groups, what is considered the 'Cognitive Sweet Spot' for group size to maximize peer-to-peer learning without diluting individual attention?",
            "options": [
                "3 to 5 participants",
                "8 to 12 participants",
                "15 to 25 participants",
                "Unlimited, provided there is a moderator",
                "2 to 4 participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that 8-12 participants allow for sufficient diversity of experience (social proof) while maintaining enough intimacy for the coach to track individual progress."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When adapting the G.R.O.W. Method™ for group delivery (Lesson 2), how should the 'W' (Way Forward) phase be structured to ensure accountability?",
            "options": [
                "The coach assigns the same goal to everyone to simplify tracking",
                "Participants keep their goals private to avoid comparison",
                "Participants declare one 'Micro-Action' to the group to leverage social commitment",
                "The coach skips this phase to save time in a group setting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Public commitment in a group setting significantly increases adherence rates. Declaring a 'Micro-Action' creates a 'social contract' within the group ecosystem."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Adult Learning Principles (Andragogy). Which of Knowles' 6 principles explains why parents are more engaged when learning how to manage 'picky eating' rather than general 'macronutrient theory'?",
            "options": [
                "The Need to Know",
                "Self-Concept",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adults are 'problem-centered' learners. They are most motivated to learn when the information provides immediate solutions to real-life challenges, such as mealtime power struggles."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, you encounter 'The Dominator'—a parent who consumes 40% of the Q&A time discussing their child's specific allergies. What is the recommended 'Pivot' technique?",
            "options": [
                "Ask the parent to wait until the end of the 6-week program",
                "Interrupt them and move to the next person immediately",
                "Validate the concern, then bridge to a universal theme that benefits the whole group",
                "Mute their microphone or ignore their hand raise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective facilitation involves validating the individual while 'bridging' back to the collective. For example: 'That is a complex situation. Let's look at how the underlying principle of label reading applies to everyone here.'"

        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "According to statistics in Lesson 5 (Hybrid Ecosystems), what is the maximum recommended length for an asynchronous 'Micro-Learning' video to maintain a 90% completion rate among busy parents?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data from digital learning platforms indicates that parent engagement drops significantly after the 7-minute mark due to the 'interruption-heavy' nature of caregiving."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "When building strategic partnerships with pediatric clinics (Lesson 6), what is the most compelling 'Value Proposition' for a busy Pediatrician?",

                "The coach will rewrite the clinic's medical protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doctors often feel frustrated by the lack of time for lifestyle counseling. A coach provides a 'referral solution' for the behavioral implementation that the physician lacks time to deliver."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "The 'GROW Index' for groups (Lesson 7) measures social cohesion. A 2022 meta-analysis cited in the lesson showed that group-based pediatric interventions achieved what percentage higher retention compared to 1-on-1 models?",

                "5%",
                "12%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study (n=4,120) found a 22% higher retention rate in group settings, largely attributed to the 'Normalization' effect—parents feeling they are not alone in their struggles."

            "id": "q34_8",

            "options": [
                "Group agreements do not need to mention scope of practice",
                "Group agreements must include a 'Peer Confidentiality' clause, as the coach cannot guarantee what other parents will share",
                "Group programs do not require a signed agreement",
                "Only the coach is required to sign the group agreement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a group setting, you must legally mandate that participants keep each other's shared information private, protecting the 'safe space' and mitigating your liability for peer disclosures."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Case Study: You are running a 'Sugar-Free Family' workshop. You notice 'The Silent Parent' has not spoken for three sessions. What is the best pedagogical move?",
            "options": [
                "Call on them unexpectedly to force participation",
                "Assume they are not interested and focus on the active participants",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introverted or overwhelmed learners often thrive in 'low-stakes' participation formats like small breakout pairs or typing in a chat box before speaking to the whole group."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "In the 'Train the Trainer' scaling model (Lesson 8), what is the purpose of 'Methodological Fidelity'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure every coach uses the exact same jokes",

                "To make the program as long and complicated as possible"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fidelity ensures that as you scale, the quality and 'brand promise' of the pediatric outcomes remain consistent, regardless of which coach is leading the group."
