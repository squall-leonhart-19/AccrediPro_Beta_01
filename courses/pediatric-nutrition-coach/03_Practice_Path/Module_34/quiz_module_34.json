            "question": "According to the 'Intimacy-Impact Ratio' discussed in Lesson 1, what is the optimal participant range for a high-impact pediatric group coaching program to ensure both peer support and individual attention?",
            "options": [
                "3-5 participants",
                "8-12 participants",

                "8-12 participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 establishes that 8-12 participants is the 'sweet spot' for maintaining intimacy while benefiting from the diverse perspectives and social modeling of a group environment."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When adapting the G.R.O.W. Method™ for group delivery, how should the 'R' (Reality) phase be facilitated to avoid the session becoming a series of individual check-ins?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should speak to each parent one-on-one while others watch",
                "Skip the Reality phase to save time in group settings",
                "Identify 'Universal Barriers' through collective polling or whiteboarding",
                "Have parents write their reality in a private journal and not share it"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In group settings, the Reality phase is most effective when the coach identifies common themes or 'Universal Barriers' (e.g., time poverty, picky eating) that resonate with the majority of the group."

            "id": "q34_3",

                "Long, lecture-style sessions lasting over 90 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adult learners, especially busy parents, are motivated by the 'Orientation to Learning'—they need solutions that are immediately applicable to their current challenges at home."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "A facilitator encounters a 'Dominant Parent' who frequently interrupts others to share long anecdotes. Which technique from Lesson 4 is most appropriate to maintain group balance?",

                "Ask the parent to leave the session immediately",
                "Use the 'Parking Lot' technique to defer specific personal stories to the end",

                "Stop the session and explain the rules of etiquette to the whole group"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Parking Lot' technique allows the facilitator to acknowledge the participant's input while keeping the group on track, deferring off-topic or overly long personal stories to a later time."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In the 'Hybrid Digital Ecosystem' model (Lesson 5), what is the primary purpose of 'Asynchronous Micro-Learning' between live sessions?",
            "options": [
                "To replace the need for live sessions entirely",
                "To increase the 'Dose-Response' effect and maintain behavioral momentum",
                "To reduce the price of the program by 50%",
                "To provide entertainment for the children while parents cook"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynchronous elements provide small, frequent touchpoints that increase the 'dose' of the intervention, leading to better habit formation and higher success rates (the 'Dose-Response' effect)."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "When pitching a group program to a pediatric clinic (Lesson 6), which 'Value Proposition' is most likely to secure a partnership with a physician?",

                "The program will reduce the clinic's overhead costs by 30%",
                "The program provides the 'Behavioral Architecture' that physicians lack time to implement",
                "The coach will handle all insurance billing for the clinic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physicians often face a 'time-gap' where they can diagnose but cannot provide the intensive behavioral support needed for nutritional change. The coach fills this 'Behavioral Architecture' role."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "The 'GROW Index' for groups (Lesson 7) measures progress across three domains. Which of the following is a primary metric in the 'Behavioral Adherence' domain?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The GROW Index focuses on tangible, quantitative behavioral markers, such as the consistent implementation of specific dietary protocols (e.g., Green-Light meals)."

                "The coach assumes all responsibility for the child's health outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clear boundaries are essential for liability. Coaches must explicitly state that group sessions are educational and coaching-based, not a medical or therapeutic diagnosis."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "In the 'Train the Trainer' scaling model, what does the 'Standardization Coefficient' ensure?",
            "options": [
                "That every facilitator charges the exact same price",
                "That the curriculum is delivered with high 'Inter-Rater Reliability' and fidelity",
                "That the program is translated into at least five languages",
                "That all coaches have the same personality type"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardization ensures that no matter who is facilitating, the core methodology and quality of the GROW system remain consistent (fidelity)."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 7 compared group-based pediatric interventions to individual coaching. What was a key finding regarding 'Social Modeling'?",
            "options": [
                "Group participants were 27% more likely to sustain habits at 6 months due to peer accountability",
                "Individual coaching was 50% more effective in all categories",
                "Group programs caused more stress for parents than individual sessions",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that the 'Social Modeling' inherent in groups leads to significantly higher long-term adherence rates (approximately 27% higher) compared to isolated 1-on-1 coaching."
