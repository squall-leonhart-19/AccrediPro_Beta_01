            "question": "A 12-year-old male client presents with acanthosis nigricans and a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dL. According to the pediatric metabolic health guidelines discussed in Lesson 1, which additional marker is most predictive of early-stage insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c of 5.4%",
                "HOMA-IR score greater than 3.16",
                "Total Cholesterol of 190 mg/dL",
                "Post-prandial glucose of 120 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While fasting glucose and HbA1c may remain within 'normal' ranges in children, a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score exceeding 3.16 is a validated threshold for identifying insulin resistance in the pediatric population, often preceding clinical hyperglycemia."

            "question": "Lesson 2 explores the Gut-Brain Axis. Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gut, and how does this impact pediatric neurodevelopment?",
            "options": [
                "25%; primarily affects local gastric motility",
                "50%; influences the blood-brain barrier permeability",
                "90-95%; communicates with the CNS via the Vagus Nerve to influence mood and behavior",
                "10%; acts as a precursor to dopamine in the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "90-95% of serotonin is produced in the gut. Through the 'bi-directional highway' of the Vagus nerve and the production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), the microbiome significantly influences pediatric neuro-psychiatric health."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Micronutrient Synergy' (Lesson 3), why is the administration of Vitamin D3 without Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) potentially problematic for a developing child's cardiovascular and skeletal health?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3 inhibits the absorption of K2 in the small intestine",
                "Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, but K2 is required to activate Osteocalcin and Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) to direct that calcium into bones and away from arteries",
                "Vitamin K2 is required to convert D3 into its active form, 1,25(OH)2D",
                "The combination causes a rapid depletion of intracellular magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 increases the demand for K2. Without K2, the increased calcium absorbed by D3 can remain in the soft tissues (calcification) rather than being integrated into the bone matrix via K2-dependent proteins."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Research discussed in Lesson 4 regarding ADHD suggests that children with the condition often present with significantly lower peripheral levels of which specific mineral, which serves as a cofactor for dopamine synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Copper",
                "Manganese",
                "Ferritin (Iron stores)",
                "Selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies show that children with ADHD often have lower serum ferritin levels. Iron is a crucial cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production, which is central to ADHD pathophysiology."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights 'Obesogens' like Phthalates and Bisphenol A (BPA). What is the primary mechanism by which these environmental toxins disrupt pediatric endocrine health?",
            "options": [
                "They cause immediate destruction of pancreatic beta cells",
                "They act as ligands for PPAR-gamma receptors, triggering adipogenesis and disrupting leptin signaling",
                "They block the absorption of dietary fiber in the colon",
                "They increase the renal clearance of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) like phthalates are known as 'obesogens' because they activate Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which programs stem cells to become fat cells and increases fat storage."

            "question": "For a competitive adolescent athlete (Lesson 6), what is the recommended protein intake range to support both growth and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during intense training cycles?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "2.5 - 3.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "Exactly 0.95 g/kg regardless of activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the RDA for sedentary children is lower, adolescent athletes require 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight to support the dual demands of physiological growth and athletic recovery."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Mechanostat Theory' in Lesson 7, what is the critical 'window of opportunity' for maximizing peak bone mass through nutritional synergy and mechanical loading?",
            "options": [
                "Birth to age 5",
                "The two years surrounding peak height velocity (puberty)",
                "After the age of 21 when growth plates close",
                "Exclusively during the first 1,000 days of life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Up to 90% of peak bone mass is acquired by age 18-20, but the years surrounding puberty (the 'window of opportunity') are the most critical for nutritional and mechanical interventions to prevent osteoporosis later in life."

            "question": "In Behavioral Coaching (Lesson 8), the 'Division of Responsibility' (DOR) model suggests that the parent is responsible for 'what, when, and where' food is served. What is the child's primary responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Cleaning the plate to ensure nutrient density",
                "Choosing which vegetables to buy at the store",
                "Whether to eat and how much to eat from what is provided",
                "Calculating their own macronutrient ratios"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DOR model, developed by Ellyn Satter, emphasizes that when parents take over the 'how much' (the child's job), it leads to power struggles and disrupts the child's internal hunger/satiety cues."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Which specific fatty acid ratio has been shown in clinical trials to be most effective for improving attention and reducing hyperactivity in neurodivergent children?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses of Omega-3 supplementation in pediatric ADHD suggest that supplements with higher ratios of EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) relative to DHA are more effective for improving clinical symptoms of inattention."

            "question": "A 15-year-old female athlete presents with recurrent stress fractures. Despite adequate Calcium and Vitamin D intake, her Boron levels are low. How does Boron contribute to bone structural integrity?",
            "options": [
                "It replaces calcium in the hydroxyapatite crystal",
                "It extends the half-life of Vitamin D and estrogen, and reduces urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium",
                "It acts as a primary stimulant for growth hormone secretion",
                "It increases the acidity of the stomach to improve mineral ionization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boron is a trace mineral that plays a synergistic role by reducing the excretion of bone-building minerals and enhancing the biological activity of Vitamin D and steroid hormones involved in bone remodeling."
