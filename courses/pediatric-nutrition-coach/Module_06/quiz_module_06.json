            "question": "In pediatric metabolic health, clinical research suggests that a Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) score above which threshold is typically indicative of insulin resistance in prepubertal children?",
            "options": ["1.2", "2.6", "4.5", "5.2"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While adult thresholds vary, a HOMA-IR score exceeding 2.6 in prepubertal children is a widely recognized clinical marker for early-stage insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Regarding the Gut-Brain Axis, which specific Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is most noted for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)?",
            "options": ["Acetate", "Propionate", "Butyrate", "Succinate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, promoting the expression of BDNF, which is critical for neuroplasticity and cognitive development in children."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "When optimizing micronutrient synergy for bone health, why is the administration of Vitamin K2 (as MK-7) considered essential alongside high-dose Vitamin D3?",
            "options": ["It increases the absorption of Vitamin D in the small intestine", "It activates osteocalcin, ensuring calcium is deposited in the bone matrix rather than soft tissues", "It prevents the breakdown of Vitamin D in the liver", "It acts as a primary antioxidant for the bone marrow"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, but Vitamin K2 is required to activate the proteins (osteocalcin and matrix GLA protein) that direct that calcium into the bones and teeth."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of nutritional interventions for ADHD found that clinical efficacy is highest when Omega-3 supplementation maintains which specific ratio of EPA to DHA?",
            "options": ["1:1 ratio", "1:2 ratio (Higher DHA)", "3:1 or higher ratio (Higher EPA)", "1:10 ratio"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that supplements with a higher EPA to DHA ratio (3:1 or greater) show more significant improvements in attention and behavioral symptoms in children with ADHD."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which mechanism best explains how environmental toxins like phthalates act as 'obesogens' in the pediatric population?",
            "options": ["They immediately destroy pancreatic beta cells", "They activate Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ), increasing adipocyte differentiation", "They prevent the absorption of dietary fats in the gut", "They inhibit the production of ghrelin, the hunger hormone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and BPA are known to activate PPARγ, a master regulator of adipogenesis, which leads to an increase in the number and size of fat cells during critical developmental windows."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "According to the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) framework, what is the minimum 'Energy Availability' (EA) threshold required to prevent menstrual dysfunction and bone mineral density loss in adolescent female athletes?",
            "options": ["15 kcal/kg FFM/day", "30 kcal/kg FFM/day", "45 kcal/kg FFM/day", "60 kcal/kg FFM/day"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An energy availability below 30 kcal per kilogram of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the critical threshold where hormonal disruption and impaired bone modeling typically occur."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In the context of 'Mechanotransduction' in pediatric bone modeling, which cells are primarily responsible for sensing physical load and signaling osteoblasts to form new bone?",
            "options": ["Osteoclasts", "Osteocytes", "Chondrocytes", "Adipocytes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Osteocytes act as the 'mechanosensors' of the bone; they detect fluid flow and physical strain, sending signals to modulate the activity of bone-building osteoblasts."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In Ellyn Satter's 'Division of Responsibility' (DOR) for pediatric feeding, which of the following is the child's exclusive responsibility?",
            "options": ["Determining what food is provided", "Choosing the location of the meal", "Deciding how much, if any, of the offered food to eat", "Setting the timing of snacks"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The parent is responsible for the 'what, when, and where' of feeding, while the child is responsible for 'how much' and 'whether' they eat, which helps preserve innate hunger cues."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Which micronutrient deficiency is most strongly associated with the development of Pica (the ingestion of non-food items) in neurodivergent children?",
            "options": ["Vitamin B12", "Zinc", "Iron", "Vitamin A"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency (with or without anemia) is the most common nutritional correlate for Pica behaviors. Zinc deficiency is also frequently observed in these cases."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Why must Magnesium status be assessed before increasing a child's Vitamin D intake to therapeutic levels?",
            "options": ["Magnesium is a cofactor for the enzymes that convert Vitamin D into its active form", "High Vitamin D levels cause the body to stop absorbing Magnesium", "Magnesium and Vitamin D compete for the same receptor in the gut", "Magnesium is required to transport Vitamin D through the blood"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "All enzymes that metabolize Vitamin D require Magnesium as a cofactor. If a child is deficient in Magnesium, Vitamin D supplementation may remain ineffective or potentially deplete Magnesium stores further."
