            "question": "A 14-month-old child presents with weight-for-length at the 3rd percentile and has crossed two major percentile lines downward over four months. To achieve catch-up growth in complex Failure to Thrive (FTT), what is the generally recommended caloric intake target?",
            "options": [
                "100% of the RDA for the child's actual weight",
                "120% to 150% of the RDA for the child's expected weight-age",
                "Strictly 200% of the RDA to ensure rapid weight gain",
                "The same caloric intake as a neurotypical peer of the same age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For complex FTT, catch-up growth typically requires 120-150% of the RDA for the child's 'weight-age' (the age at which the child's current weight would be at the 50th percentile) to overcome the energy deficit."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "Which clinical feature most accurately distinguishes Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) from developmentally appropriate 'picky eating' in a 6-year-old child?",
            "options": [
                "A preference for 'white foods' like bread and pasta",
                "Occasional refusal to try new vegetable varieties",
                "Nutritional deficiency or dependence on oral nutritional supplements to maintain weight",
                "Dislike of strong-smelling foods like fish or broccoli"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While picky eaters may have preferences, ARFID is characterized by significant weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning, often requiring supplement dependence."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In pediatric cases of Metabolic Syndrome and suspected Insulin Resistance, a Triglyceride to HDL-C (TG/HDL) ratio above which threshold is considered a significant biomarker for cardiovascular risk?",

                "1.0",
                "2.0",
                "3.0",
                "5.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio > 3.0 in children and adolescents is strongly associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome complications."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A 12-year-old with Crohn’s Disease is prescribed Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) to induce remission. According to clinical guidelines, what percentage of daily calories must come from the formula for EEN to be effective?",
            "options": [
                "50% of total calories",
                "75% of total calories",
                "80-90% of total calories",
                "100% of total calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "EEN requires 100% of daily nutritional requirements to be met via liquid formula (polymeric or elemental) for 6-8 weeks to maximize the likelihood of mucosal healing and remission."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When working with neurodivergent children (ASD/ADHD), research indicates that sensory-based food selectivity frequently leads to which specific micronutrient profile?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with ASD often exhibit lower intakes of Calcium, Zinc, and Vitamin D due to the exclusion of whole food groups (like dairy or meats) based on texture or sensory aversions."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE mediated allergy. What is the hallmark timing and symptom of an acute FPIES reaction after ingesting a trigger food?",
            "options": [

                "Anaphylaxis requiring immediate epinephrine within 30 seconds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acute FPIES typically presents with severe, repetitive vomiting 1-4 hours after ingestion, often leading to lethargy and dehydration, unlike the immediate skin or respiratory reactions seen in IgE-mediated allergies."

                "15 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energy Availability (EA) below 30 kcal per kilogram of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the critical threshold where the body begins to suppress physiological functions to conserve energy."

                "Ignoring socioeconomic factors to focus purely on biochemistry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed nutrition recognizes that food insecurity and past trauma affect eating behaviors; prioritizing 'felt safety' and consistent access to food is essential for regulation and health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RED-S can occur even in athletes with a 'normal' BMI if their energy intake does not match their high energy expenditure, leading to bone density loss and menstrual irregularities."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "For a child with ADHD taking stimulant medication who experiences significant 'mid-day' appetite suppression, which strategy is recommended to maintain growth velocity?",

                "Eliminating all snacks to ensure the child is hungry for dinner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To combat medication-induced appetite suppression, practitioners recommend a high-calorie/high-protein breakfast before the medication kicks in and 'mechanical eating' (scheduled high-density snacks) when the medication wears off in the evening."
