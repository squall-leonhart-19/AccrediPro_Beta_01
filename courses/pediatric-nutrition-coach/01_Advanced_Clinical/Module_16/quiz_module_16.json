            "question": "In the context of Complex Failure to Thrive (FTT), which clinical indicator most accurately signifies a 'growth failure' requiring immediate intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A single weight measurement below the 10th percentile on CDC charts.",
                "A child's weight-for-age falling across two or more major percentile lines over time.",
                "A height-for-age measurement that remains at the 15th percentile for six months.",
                "A caloric intake that is 10% below the Estimated Energy Requirement (EER)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard diagnostic criteria for FTT include weight-for-age dropping below the 5th percentile or, more significantly, a downward trend where the child crosses two or more major percentile lines (e.g., from the 50th to the 10th)."

            "question": "A 7-year-old patient presents with extreme food selectivity, eating only three specific brands of white crackers. Unlike 'picky eating,' an ARFID diagnosis is confirmed if which of the following is present?",
            "options": [
                "The child expresses a desire to lose weight or has body dysmorphia.",
                "The child refuses to eat vegetables but accepts most fruits and proteins.",
                "The restriction leads to significant nutritional deficiency or dependence on oral supplements.",
                "The behavior has lasted for less than one month following a viral illness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) is distinguished from typical picky eating by the severity of the consequences, such as significant weight loss, nutritional deficiency, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning, without body image distortion."

            "question": "When screening for Pediatric Metabolic Syndrome, which Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) is considered a validated 'red flag' for visceral adiposity and insulin resistance across all pediatric age groups?",
            "options": [
                "WHtR > 0.40",
                "WHtR > 0.45",

                "WHtR > 0.65"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) greater than 0.50 is a simple, effective screening tool that correlates strongly with visceral fat and increased cardiometabolic risk in children, regardless of age or gender."

            "question": "For a pediatric patient with Crohn’s Disease, Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN) is often preferred over corticosteroids because:",
            "options": [
                "EEN has a 100% success rate in preventing future flares.",
                "EEN induces clinical remission while simultaneously promoting mucosal healing and growth.",
                "Corticosteroids are ineffective in children under the age of 12.",
                "EEN requires only 20% of daily calories to be delivered via formula."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EEN (using 100% liquid formula for 6-8 weeks) is as effective as steroids for inducing remission but is superior because it promotes mucosal healing and provides the nutrition necessary for growth, which steroids can inhibit."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In Neurodiversity protocols (ADHD/ASD), why is the 'Division of Responsibility' often modified for children with sensory processing sensitivities?",
            "options": [
                "Because these children cannot feel hunger or satiety cues at all.",
                "To prevent the child from ever feeling hungry, which triggers meltdowns.",
                "To ensure a 'safe food' is always present to prevent total caloric rejection and anxiety.",
                "Because parents should force-feed children with ASD to ensure nutrient density."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the core of the Division of Responsibility remains, practitioners modify it for neurodivergent children by ensuring 'safe' (sensory-compatible) foods are always available to reduce mealtime anxiety and prevent dangerous levels of food refusal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FPIES is a non-IgE mediated allergy characterized by delayed (1-4 hours) profuse vomiting and potential lethargy or shock, typically without the skin or respiratory symptoms seen in classic IgE allergies."

                "1,200 total calories per day regardless of activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that physiological functions (hormonal balance, bone health) begin to be impaired when energy availability falls below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day."

            "question": "According to the lesson on Socioeconomic Barriers, how does 'Toxic Stress' from multi-generational trauma physically impact a child's nutritional status?",
            "options": [
                "It has no physical impact; it only affects food choices.",
                "It decreases cortisol levels, leading to excessive weight loss.",
                "Chronic activation of the HPA axis can alter metabolism and increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.",
                "It prevents the absorption of Vitamin C in the small intestine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Toxic stress and trauma trigger the HPA axis, leading to chronically elevated cortisol. This hormonal shift promotes visceral fat storage, alters appetite regulation, and increases the long-term risk for metabolic syndrome."

            "question": "A child with Celiac Disease continues to have elevated tTG-IgA levels despite a 'gluten-free' diet. What is the most common 'hidden' source of cross-contamination to investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "Fresh fruits and vegetables.",

                "Plain white rice cooked in a dedicated pot."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In persistent Celiac cases, cross-contamination in the kitchen (shared toasters, scratched non-stick pans, or wooden utensils) is the leading cause of continued gluten exposure and elevated antibodies."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have frequently identified lower serum levels of Zinc and Magnesium in children with ADHD. Supplementation in deficient individuals has shown modest improvements in hyperactivity and impulsivity."
