            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The G.R.O.W. model prioritizes Gut health as the foundation because nutrient absorption and the gut-brain axis influence all subsequent regulatory and optimization efforts."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A coach is synthesizing data for a 7-year-old client. The clinical data shows low serum ferritin (12 ng/mL), while behavioral data shows high 'food neophobia.' How should these metrics be merged for prioritization?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the ferritin until the food neophobia is resolved through exposure therapy.",
                "Prioritize iron-rich liquid supplementation (clinical) while concurrently implementing low-pressure sensory play (behavioral).",
                "Focus exclusively on behavioral rewards for eating red meat.",
                "Treat the ferritin only if the child's growth percentile drops below the 5th percentile."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced data synthesis requires addressing clinical deficiencies (ferritin) immediately while building the behavioral architecture (sensory play) to support long-term dietary intake."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In multi-system cases, physiological 'blockages' like constipation are prioritized because they directly impact appetite, mood, and the efficacy of other interventions."

                "Do nothing, as coaches should never mention clinical markers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interdisciplinary synthesis involves providing organized, objective data and observations to the medical team to facilitate their diagnostic process without overstepping scope."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that environmental nudges and changing default choices can increase healthy food selection by 40% or more by reducing cognitive load."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are predictive. Parental self-efficacy is a leading indicator because it predicts the consistency of the nutritional environment which eventually leads to physical outcomes."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "In the case of 'Case Study: Sophia' (Module 18, L3), why was 'Sensory Integration' prioritized over 'Caloric Density' despite her being underweight?",
            "options": [
                "Because calories don't matter in pediatric nutrition.",
                "Because her sensory defensiveness was the root cause of her food refusal; forcing calories would have increased trauma.",
                "Because the coach forgot to check her weight.",
                "Because the pediatrician requested it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic prioritization recognizes that if sensory defensiveness is the 'bottleneck,' adding high-calorie foods the child finds repulsive will only worsen the long-term feeding relationship."

                "Ignore the culture score as long as the bloodwork is good.",
                "Celebrate the clinical win and end the coaching engagement.",
                "Pivot the strategy to address 'Behavioral Architecture' and sustainability, as the current progress is likely fragile.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "True mastery requires synthesis. If clinical markers improve at the cost of family harmony (Food Culture), the results are not sustainable. The coach must pivot to ensure the 'Wellness' (W) of the G.R.O.W. model is supported."
