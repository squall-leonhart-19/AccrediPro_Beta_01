            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The G.R.O.W. model prioritizes physiological stability (Gut) and biological timing (Rhythm) before addressing specific nutrient gaps (Optimization) or long-term behavioral habits (Wellness)."

            "question": "When synthesizing clinical and behavioral data, a 'Red Flag' discrepancy occurs when a child's Growth Z-score remains stable at +0.5, but the 'Mealtime Stress Scale' score increases by 40%. What does this suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The child is overeating and requires immediate caloric restriction.",
                "Nutritional adequacy is being maintained at a high cost to the family's behavioral health.",
                "The growth data is likely inaccurate and should be discarded.",
                "The child has developed a sudden malabsorption syndrome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stable growth alongside rising caregiver stress indicates that while calories are sufficient, the behavioral architecture is failing, which is unsustainable and increases the risk of future eating disorders."

            "question": "In a complex multi-system case involving ASD, Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), and sensory processing issues, why is IDA prioritized as a 'Keystone' clinical target?",
            "options": [
                "Because iron supplements are easier to administer than behavioral therapy.",
                "Because IDA can exacerbate sensory sensitivity and irritability, hindering behavioral interventions.",
                "Because ASD cannot be managed until iron levels reach 50 ng/mL.",
                "Because the coach is legally required to treat anemia before addressing diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic prioritization targets 'keystone' issues where physiological correction (iron) directly improves the efficacy of behavioral interventions (sensory/feeding therapy)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach acts as the 'Integrator,' translating the clinical directives of specialists (like SLPs) into practical, family-centered dietary strategies within their scope of practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice architecture involves designing the environment to make the desired choice (eating vegetables) the easiest or most 'default' option, rather than using pressure or deception."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dietary Diversity Scores (DDS) track the variety of food groups (e.g., 5-8 groups) consumed, which is a validated proxy for micronutrient adequacy in pediatric populations."

            "question": "When synthesizing a 12-month roadmap for a child with 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT), why is 'Growth Velocity' prioritized over 'Food Quality' in the first 90 days?",
            "options": [
                "Because organic food is too expensive for FTT families.",
                "Because biological safety and brain development require immediate caloric stabilization.",
                "Because food quality has no impact on pediatric health.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cases of FTT, the physiological risk of malnutrition takes precedence. Stabilizing growth velocity is the first priority before refining the 'purity' or 'quality' of the food sources."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
