            "options": [
                "To identify the statistical average of a child's caloric intake compared to peers",
                "To distinguish between acute nutritional deficits and chronic underlying physiological dysfunction",
                "To provide a list of recipes that the child is likely to accept based on age",
                "To determine the financial feasibility of the proposed nutrition plan for the family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical synthesis involves moving beyond symptoms to recognize patterns that distinguish between simple intake issues and complex physiological or metabolic dysfunctions."

            "question": "In Advanced Growth Modeling (L2), when calculating energy requirements for catch-up growth in a child with a Weight-for-Length Z-score of -3.2, what is the standard 'Catch-up Factor' multiplier used for initial planning?",
            "options": [
                "1.1 to 1.2 times the RDA for chronological age",
                "1.5 to 2.0 times the RDA for weight-age",
                "Exactly 100 kcal/kg regardless of age",
                "0.8 times the RDA to prevent refeeding syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For significant growth faltering (Z-score < -3), the catch-up growth formula typically utilizes 1.5 to 2.0 times the RDA for the child's 'weight-age' (the age at which their current weight would be at the 50th percentile)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory over-responsive children require gradual 'Food Chaining'—modifying texture, color, or flavor in micro-steps—to avoid sensory shutdown or fight-or-flight responses."
