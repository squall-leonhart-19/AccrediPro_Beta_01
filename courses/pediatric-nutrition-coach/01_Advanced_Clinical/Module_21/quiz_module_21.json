            "question": "In the process of Clinical Synthesis (L1), which hierarchy of intervention is considered the most critical for a child presenting with both sensory-based food aversion and a Weight-for-Age Z-score (WAZ) of -3.2?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate sensory desensitization therapy",
                "Nutritional rehabilitation to address acute malnutrition and growth failure",

                "Micronutrient supplementation for cognitive support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to clinical synthesis protocols, medical stability and the reversal of severe growth failure (WAZ < -3) take precedence over behavioral or sensory interventions to prevent long-term developmental sequelae."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When calculating 'Catch-Up Growth' requirements (L2) for a child with stunting, which formula is most accurate for determining the target caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "(RDA for Age x Ideal Weight for Age) / Actual Weight",
                "(RDA for Weight-Age x Ideal Weight for Height) / Actual Weight",
                "Standard RDA for age + 500 kcal per day",
                "Actual Weight x 1.2 activity factor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard catch-up formula uses the RDA for the child's height-age (the age at which their current height would be the 50th percentile) multiplied by the ideal weight for their current height, divided by actual weight."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current precision protocols suggest 3-6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron. Emerging research also supports alternate-day dosing to reduce hepcidin induction and improve fractional absorption."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline, DHA, and Lutein form a metabolic triad essential for membrane synthesis in the brain, specifically supporting hippocampal function and white matter integrity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that restriction increases the reward value of forbidden foods, leading to counter-regulatory eating behaviors and a higher risk of pediatric obesity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive planning for neurodivergent clients emphasizes food chaining—linking a currently accepted food to a new one via small sensory increments—to expand the palate without triggering a fight-or-flight response."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In Outcome Measurement (L7), a 'Plan Titration' is clinically indicated if a child's Weight-for-Height Z-score (WHZ) does not improve by how much over a 4-week period in a rehabilitation context?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If the WHZ does not show a positive trend (typically a gain of 0.1-0.2 Z-score points) within a month of intervention, the practitioner must titrate the plan by increasing caloric density or addressing underlying malabsorption."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 3' (3 meals, 3 snacks, roughly 3 hours apart) helps establish a predictable feeding schedule, which reduces grazing and improves the child's ability to recognize internal hunger and satiety cues."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "25(OH)D is the primary circulating form and the best indicator of total Vitamin D status, whereas 1,25(OH)2D is often misleadingly normal or elevated even in deficiency due to parathyroid hormone regulation."
