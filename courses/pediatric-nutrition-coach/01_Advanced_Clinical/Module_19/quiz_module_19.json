            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Evidence-Based Practice (EBP), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs sit at the top of the evidence pyramid because they synthesize results from multiple high-quality studies to minimize bias."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal behavioral research shows that 'taste exposure' requires 8-15 attempts for a child to move past the neophobic response and develop a preference for a new vegetable or food."

            "options": [
                "The minimum amount required to prevent deficiency",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The UL is a safety threshold; as intake increases above the UL, the potential risk of adverse effects increases."
