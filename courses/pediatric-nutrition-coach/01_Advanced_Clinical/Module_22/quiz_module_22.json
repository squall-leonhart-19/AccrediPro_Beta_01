            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never diagnose or treat clinical conditions. Red flag symptoms like polydipsia and polyuria require immediate medical referral to stay within the coaching scope of practice."

                "There is no difference; both terms refer to the same legal document."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While parents provide legal consent, ethical practice involves seeking the child's 'assent' (usually from age 7+) to ensure the child feels respected and willing to participate in the coaching process."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
