            "question": "A Pediatric Nutrition Coach identifies that a 9-year-old client is exhibiting symptoms of selective eating alongside significant sensory processing sensitivities. What is the ethical boundary for the coach's scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnose the child with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID).",
                "Create a sensory-integration meal plan and provide therapeutic desensitization techniques.",
                "Provide education on nutrient-dense food bridges while referring to a multi-disciplinary team including a Pediatrician and Occupational Therapist.",
                "Advise the parents to use the 'division of responsibility' exclusively until the behavior resolves without outside help."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must not diagnose or provide clinical therapy for eating disorders or sensory processing issues. The ethical approach is providing general nutrition education within their scope while referring to licensed medical professionals for diagnosis and specialized treatment."

            "question": "According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the concepts of bioethics, what is the primary difference between 'Informed Consent' and 'Child Assent'?",
            "options": [
                "Consent is for medical procedures, while assent is only for nutritional coaching.",
                "Consent is the legal agreement provided by the parent/guardian; assent is the developmental agreement provided by the child.",
                "Assent is only required for children over the age of 16, whereas consent is required for all.",
                "There is no functional difference; both terms refer to the legal right to refuse treatment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In pediatric ethics, parents provide legal 'Informed Consent.' 'Child Assent' is the process of involving the child in the decision-making process at a developmentally appropriate level, usually starting around age 7, to respect their autonomy."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that weight-based teasing and stigma in childhood are significant predictors of disordered eating behaviors, including a two-fold (200%) increase in the risk of binge eating and chronic dieting later in life."

                "Showing the child their BMI-for-age percentile to motivate behavior change.",
                "Focusing exclusively on the child's weight-to-height ratio without considering height velocity.",
                "Using growth charts as an internal clinical tool to ensure adequate nourishment rather than a public metric of 'success'.",
                "Eliminating growth charts entirely to avoid any risk of weight stigma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical growth tracking involves using charts as a diagnostic tool for health and nourishment (ensuring the child follows their own curve) rather than using them as a tool for weight shaming or setting 'goal weights' for children."

                "Decline the commission or transparently disclose the financial interest while providing evidence-based, third-party tested alternatives.",
                "Accept the commission but do not tell the clients to avoid 'biasing' their decision."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 emphasizes that conflicts of interest must be avoided or, at minimum, fully disclosed. Recommending products based on financial gain rather than the client's specific nutritional needs is a violation of professional ethics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food sovereignty goes beyond 'food security' by emphasizing the right of communities to define their own food and agriculture systems, which is vital for cultural competence in coaching."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches have an ethical duty to provide evidence-based safety information. The AAP and other sports medicine organizations generally discourage the use of high-caffeine performance supplements in minors due to safety concerns."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A coach is working with a family from a culture where 'pudding-like' consistency foods are a staple for toddlers, but the coach's training suggests 'solid' finger foods are better for motor skills. What is the culturally competent ethical approach?",

            "explanation": "Cultural competence requires respecting traditional dietary patterns and working within the family's cultural framework rather than imposing one's own cultural biases as 'superior' nutrition."
