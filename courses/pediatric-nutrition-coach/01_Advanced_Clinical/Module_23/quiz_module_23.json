            "question": "When analyzing growth velocity in a 4-year-old child, a downward crossing of two or more major percentile lines on the WHO growth chart is clinically defined as:",
            "options": [
                "Normal physiological plateauing",
                "Growth faltering (Failure to Thrive) requiring immediate investigation",
                "Genetic potential adjustment",
                "Constitutional growth delay"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In advanced anthropometrics, crossing two or more major percentile lines (e.g., from the 75th to the 25th) is a primary red flag for growth faltering and necessitates a thorough nutritional and medical assessment."

            "question": "In the context of Precision Nutrient Remediation, why must high-dose Zinc supplementation be carefully balanced with Copper intake?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc induces the synthesis of metallothionein, which preferentially binds and sequesters copper, leading to deficiency.",
                "Zinc and copper compete for the SGLT1 transporter in the ileum.",
                "Copper toxicity is common when zinc levels are low.",
                "Zinc increases the renal excretion of copper by 45%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High zinc intake stimulates the production of metallothionein in intestinal cells. Metallothionein has a higher affinity for copper than zinc, trapping copper in the enterocyte and preventing its absorption into systemic circulation."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Metabolic programming research indicates that the 'First 1,000 Days' is a critical window for epigenetic optimization. Which process is a primary mechanism of this programming?",
            "options": [
                "DNA Mutation",
                "DNA Methylation and Histone Acetylation",
                "Chromosome deletion",
                "Protein denaturation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic optimization involves DNA methylation and histone modification, which alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence, often in response to maternal and early childhood nutrition."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A child with ARFID presents with extreme sensory sensitivity to textures. Which advanced behavioral intervention utilizes 'Food Chaining' to expand the diet?",

                "Pharmacological appetite stimulation only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sequential desensitization or 'Food Chaining' works by introducing new foods that share similar sensory characteristics (color, texture, temperature) to foods the child already accepts, reducing the 'fear' response."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "According to clinical guidelines in Microbiome Modulation, which probiotic strain has the highest level of evidence for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in children?",
            "options": [

                "Lactobacillus reuteri"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Saccharomyces boulardii are the most extensively studied and recommended strains for the prevention and treatment of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In Family Systems Therapy, the term 'Triangulation' in a pediatric nutrition context refers to:",
            "options": [
                "A child, parent, and coach working together effectively.",
                "Using three different food groups in every meal.",
                "A child's eating behavior becoming a diversionary focus to mask conflict between parents.",
                "The three stages of the G.R.O.W. method."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triangulation occurs when a third person (the child) is drawn into a conflict between two others (the parents). In nutrition, the child's 'picky eating' often becomes the 'problem' that prevents the parents from addressing their own relationship issues."

            "question": "Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is distinguished from typical IgE-mediated food allergies by which characteristic?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate onset of hives and wheezing",
                "Presence of positive Skin Prick Tests (SPT)",
                "Delayed onset (2-6 hours) of profuse vomiting, diarrhea, and potential lethargy",
                "It only occurs in response to peanuts and shellfish"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FPIES is a non-IgE mediated food allergy. Unlike anaphylaxis which is immediate, FPIES typically presents several hours after ingestion with severe gastrointestinal distress and can lead to hemodynamic instability."

                "Increasing synthetic folic acid intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme breaks down dopamine and estrogen. 'Slow' variants can lead to higher stress sensitivity. Managing intake of certain polyphenols (like EGCG) and providing magnesium (a COMT cofactor) helps optimize its function."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "HMOs are specialized prebiotics found in breast milk that act as a primary substrate for Bifidobacterium infantis, which helps program the infant's immune system and gut barrier."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While height-for-age reflects chronic nutritional status (stunting), weight-for-height or BMI-for-age velocity is the most sensitive measure for acute changes (wasting or rapid gain) in pediatric nutrition."
