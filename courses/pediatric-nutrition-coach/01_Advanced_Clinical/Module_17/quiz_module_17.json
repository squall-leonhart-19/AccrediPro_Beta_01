            "question": "A 5-year-old client with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) only accepts 'beige' foods with a specific crunchy texture. Which evidence-based intervention involves introducing new foods that share similar sensory characteristics to their accepted repertoire?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Food Chaining is a sensory-based strategy that builds a 'bridge' between currently accepted foods and new foods by matching texture, temperature, or flavor profiles to expand the diet gradually."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unlike Anorexia Nervosa, ARFID is characterized by food avoidance based on sensory properties, lack of interest in eating, or fear of aversive consequences (choking/vomiting), without body image distortion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FPIES is a non-IgE mediated food allergy that typically presents with delayed (1-4 hours) gastrointestinal symptoms like profuse vomiting and can lead to hemodynamic instability."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When implementing a Low-FODMAP protocol for a pediatric client with IBS-P, what is the recommended duration for the strict elimination phase before reintroduction must begin?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In pediatrics, the elimination phase is kept short (2-6 weeks) to prevent nutritional deficiencies, social isolation, and negative impacts on the gut microbiome (specifically Bifidobacteria)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
