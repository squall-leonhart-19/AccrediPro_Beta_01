            "question": "When implementing 'Food Chaining' for a neurodivergent child with sensory-based feeding issues, what is the primary mechanism of the intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Using a reward-based system to force the consumption of new textures",
                "Introducing new foods that share at least one sensory characteristic with an accepted 'safe' food",
                "Eliminating all processed foods to reduce neuro-inflammation",
                "Restricting access to preferred foods until a target food is consumed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food Chaining builds on the child's successful eating experiences by introducing new foods that share similar color, texture, shape, or flavor profiles with foods they already accept, reducing sensory overwhelm."

            "question": "A child with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is also diagnosed with Celiac Disease. If they are experiencing frequent, unexplained hypoglycemia despite consistent insulin dosing, what should the coach suspect?",
            "options": [
                "The child is consuming too much fiber",
                "The child has developed a secondary allergy to insulin",

                "The child's basal rate is naturally decreasing due to age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In children with dual T1D and Celiac diagnoses, gluten exposure causes villous atrophy, leading to the malabsorption of carbohydrates, which frequently manifests as unexplained hypoglycemia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nutritional rehabilitation for FTT typically requires 120-150% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for the child's ideal weight for their age to facilitate catch-up growth."

                "ARFID involves a significantly lower BMI than Anorexia",
                "ARFID lacks the distortion of body image or fear of weight gain found in Anorexia",
                "ARFID only occurs in children under the age of five",
                "Anorexia is purely behavioral, while ARFID is purely medical"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both involve restrictive eating and potential weight loss, ARFID is characterized by sensory sensitivity or fear of aversive consequences (like choking) rather than the body image disturbances central to Anorexia Nervosa."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CDED focuses on whole foods while excluding emulsifiers, maltodextrins, and specific animal fats that have been shown in studies to increase intestinal permeability and induce dysbiosis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care involves meeting families where they are. In cases of food insecurity, the coach should focus on Ellyn Satter's Division of Responsibility while providing practical, low-cost ways to maximize nutrition within the family's budget."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A modified Low FODMAP diet can be effective for pediatric IBS-P to identify specific triggers, but it must be implemented carefully to avoid nutritional deficiencies and disordered eating patterns."
