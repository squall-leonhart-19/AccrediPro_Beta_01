            "question": "When assessing a child with severe growth faltering, why are Z-scores clinically superior to standard growth percentiles?",
            "options": [
                "Z-scores are easier for parents to understand during a consultation.",
                "Z-scores allow for precise tracking of changes beyond the 3rd or 97th percentiles.",
                "Percentiles do not account for the child's age or biological sex.",
                "Z-scores are only used for children over the age of 18."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Z-scores (Standard Deviation scores) allow clinicians to quantify growth that falls outside the standard percentile ranges (e.g., a Z-score of -4 is much more severe than -2, even though both are below the 3rd percentile)."

            "question": "A practitioner observes a 4-year-old with 'Flag Sign' (alternating bands of light and dark color) in the hair. This NFPE finding most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Essential fatty acid deficiency.",
                "Chronic Vitamin A toxicity.",
                "Intermittent periods of protein-energy malnutrition.",
                "Excessive intake of synthetic food dyes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Flag Sign' in hair is a classic physical sign of protein-energy malnutrition, where the lighter bands represent periods of inadequate protein intake."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In pediatric biochemical assessment, why must Serum Ferritin be interpreted alongside C-Reactive Protein (CRP)?",
            "options": [
                "Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that can appear falsely elevated during inflammation.",
                "CRP is required to transport Ferritin across the blood-brain barrier.",
                "High CRP levels always indicate that iron stores are depleted.",
                "Ferritin and CRP must be added together to calculate total iron binding capacity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, a child with an active infection or inflammation may have a 'normal' ferritin level despite having low iron stores. CRP helps identify if inflammation is masking a deficiency."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BAMBI scale is a validated tool used to quantify behavioral issues during feeding, helping to distinguish between typical picky eating and more severe feeding disorders."

            "question": "During a family dynamics assessment, a 'Permissive' feeding style is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "High expectations for behavior with low responsiveness to the child's hunger cues.",
                "High responsiveness to the child's requests with low structure or boundaries at mealtimes.",
                "Low responsiveness and low demandingness, often leading to food insecurity.",
                "The gold-standard approach where the parent provides and the child decides."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Permissive feeding style involves being very responsive to the child's whims (e.g., making 'short-order' meals) but failing to provide the necessary structure for healthy eating habits."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fecal calprotectin is a protein marker of neutrophil activity in the gut; elevated levels indicate intestinal inflammation and are used to screen for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)."

            "options": [
                "It is too expensive to administer in a clinical setting.",
                "It fails to capture day-to-day variability in a child's intake.",
                "It requires the child to have advanced mathematical skills.",
                "It cannot be used for children under the age of 12."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A single 24-hour recall does not account for the high day-to-day variability in pediatric eating patterns; multiple days or a food frequency questionnaire are needed for a representative view."

                "It measures brain development in infants.",
                "It is a more sensitive indicator of acute wasting than weight-for-height in some populations.",
                "It determines the child's genetic height potential.",
