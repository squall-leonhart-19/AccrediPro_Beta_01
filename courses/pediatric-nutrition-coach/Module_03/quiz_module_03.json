            "question": "A child identified as a 'Fast Oxidizer' in metabolic typing typically requires which macronutrient ratio for optimal energy stability?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate, low protein, low fat",
                "High protein, high fat, low glycemic carbohydrates",
                "Equal parts of all macronutrients regardless of source",
                "Low protein, high fiber, zero saturated fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fast oxidizers burn through glucose rapidly; they require higher levels of protein and fats to slow down the oxidation rate and prevent blood sugar spikes and subsequent crashes."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which physiological marker distinguishes a 'true' Type I Food Allergy from a delayed Food Sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "IgG antibody response occurring 48-72 hours post-ingestion",
                "IgA mucosal response in the digestive tract",
                "IgE antibody response leading to immediate histamine release",
                "T-cell mediated response only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "True allergies are IgE-mediated and typically produce an immediate, sometimes anaphylactic, response, whereas sensitivities (IgG) are delayed and often cumulative."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "The MTHFR C677T polymorphism can reduce a child's ability to convert folic acid into its active form (5-MTHF) by approximately how much in homozygous (TT) individuals?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "Up to 70%",
                "Exactly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation can result in a 70% reduction in enzyme activity, necessitating the use of methylated folate rather than synthetic folic acid."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A child with sensory processing challenges who exhibits 'tactile defensiveness' is most likely to prefer which food profile?",
            "options": [
                "Mixed textures like stews and casseroles",
                "Uniform, predictable textures like 'beige' crunchy foods",
                "Slimy or wet foods like okra and overcooked pasta",
                "Spicy and highly acidic foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with tactile defensiveness often seek 'predictable' oral input. Crunchy, dry, uniform foods (often beige) provide consistent sensory feedback compared to mixed-texture foods."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In the context of ADHD and ASD profiles, what does the 'GFCF' dietary intervention specifically remove?",

                "Glucose and Fructose",
                "Gluten and Casein",
                "Genetically Modified Foods and Caffeine",
                "Galactose and Corn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gluten-Free Casein-Free (GFCF) diet is based on the opioid excess theory, suggesting that peptides from gluten and casein may cross the blood-brain barrier in neurodivergent children."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When recommending Magnesium for a child with ADHD who struggles with sleep and hyperactivity, which form is generally preferred for its high bioavailability and calming effect?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium Oxide",
                "Magnesium Sulfate",
                "Magnesium Glycinate",
                "Magnesium Citrate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Glycinate is chelated with the amino acid glycine, which has independent calming effects on the brain and is less likely to cause the laxative effect associated with Oxide or Citrate."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to the Module 3 case studies, what is considered the 'Gold Standard' for identifying bio-individual food triggers despite the availability of blood testing?",
            "options": [
                "The Elimination-Provocation Diet",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While lab tests provide clues, the Elimination-Provocation diet remains the clinical gold standard as it confirms the symptomatic relationship between a specific food and the individual child."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A child with a VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) polymorphism may require which of the following interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Lower than RDA doses of Vitamin D to avoid toxicity",
                "Vitamin D levels maintained at the higher end of the clinical range (50-80 ng/mL)",
                "Complete avoidance of sun exposure",
                "Supplementation with Vitamin A only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VDR polymorphisms can reduce the efficiency of Vitamin D binding; therefore, these children often require higher serum levels to achieve the same biological effect as those without the mutation."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When tailoring a diet for a vegan family (Cultural/Lifestyle preference), which nutrient is most critical to supplement, as it is not reliably found in plant foods?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Potassium",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 is exclusively produced by bacteria and is found naturally only in animal products. Vegan children must supplement B12 to prevent neurological damage and anemia."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Leo' (Lesson 8), which intervention led to a significant reduction in 'brain fog' and eczema?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing fruit juice intake for Vitamin C",
                "Removing synthetic food dyes and high-fructose corn syrup",
                "Identifying and removing a delayed IgG sensitivity to dairy",
                "Switching from tap water to alkaline water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As detailed in the Lesson 8 case studies, addressing delayed food sensitivities (specifically dairy in the Leo case) often resolves both dermatological (eczema) and neurological (brain fog) symptoms."
