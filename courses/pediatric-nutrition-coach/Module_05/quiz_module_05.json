            "question": "According to the psychology of childhood food preferences, at what age does 'food neophobia'—the fear of new foods—typically peak in children?",
            "options": [
                "6 to 12 months",
                "2 to 6 years",
                "7 to 10 years",
                "During the onset of puberty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that food neophobia typically emerges around age 2 and peaks between ages 2 and 6, which is thought to be an evolutionary survival mechanism to prevent mobile toddlers from ingesting toxic plants."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In Ellyn Satter’s 'Division of Responsibility' (DOR) framework, which of the following is the child's primary responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Deciding what food is served at the meal",
                "Determining the timing of the meal",
                "Deciding whether to eat and how much to eat",
                "Selecting the location where the meal is eaten"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DOR model dictates that the parent is responsible for the 'what, when, and where,' while the child is responsible for 'how much' and 'whether' to eat from the foods provided."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of pediatric feeding studies suggests that a child may need how many neutral exposures to a new food before developing a preference for it?",
            "options": [
                "1 to 3 exposures",
                "4 to 6 exposures",
                "8 to 15 exposures",
                "At least 30 exposures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Birch et al.) show that it typically takes 8 to 15 repeated, neutral exposures for a child to move from rejection to acceptance of a new food."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "The 'Crowding Out' method focuses on which of the following psychological principles to reduce dietary resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Strict restriction of 'bad' foods to induce craving",
                "Adding nutrient-dense options to the plate rather than focusing on subtraction",
                "Using high-value rewards for every bite of a vegetable",
                "Implementing a 'no-thank-you bite' rule for every meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crowding out is a low-stress transition method that focuses on the 'addition' of healthy foods, which naturally displaces less nutrient-dense options without the psychological trigger of restriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Why is using dessert as a reward for eating vegetables (the 'Premack Principle' applied poorly) often counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the vegetable seem like a chore and the dessert seem even more valuable",
                "It causes an immediate insulin spike that prevents vegetable absorption",
                "It decreases the child's total caloric intake for the day",
                "It confuses the child's understanding of macronutrients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "This creates an 'overjustification effect' where the vegetable is viewed as a barrier to be overcome, decreasing the child's intrinsic motivation to enjoy the vegetable for its own sake."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When setting age-appropriate goals for a 4-year-old, which goal follows the NURTURE methodology most effectively?",
            "options": [
                "'I will eat 25 grams of fiber every day this week.'",
                "'I will try one tiny 'explorer bite' of a new color each day.'",
                "'I will lose 2 pounds by the end of the month.'",
                "'I will stop eating all processed sugar immediately.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Goals for young children should be behavior-based, sensory-focused, and achievable. 'Explorer bites' gamify the process and focus on the transition rather than clinical metrics."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "To build food competence and autonomy, what is the 'Two-Choice' method for meal planning?",
            "options": [
                "The child chooses between two different fast-food restaurants",
                "The parent offers a choice between a healthy option and a candy bar",
                "The parent offers two healthy options (e.g., 'broccoli or carrots?') for the side dish",
                "The child must choose between eating the meal or going to bed hungry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Two-Choice' method provides a sense of autonomy within the parent's boundaries, allowing the child to feel in control while ensuring a nutritious outcome."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In the context of school lunches, 'Sensory Bridging' refers to which strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Forcing a child to eat in a loud cafeteria to build resilience",
                "Introducing a new food that shares a similar texture or flavor to a currently accepted food",
                "Packing only foods that the child has never seen before to surprise them",
                "Using a blindfold to help the child focus on the smell of the food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory bridging uses the 'known' to introduce the 'unknown' (e.g., if a child likes crunchy potato chips, introducing crunchy snap peas), which reduces the sensory 'shock' of new foods."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key strategy for long-term habit sustainability in a family environment?",
            "options": [
                "Changing the entire pantry overnight to remove all temptations",
                "Focusing on 'Perfect Plates' at every single meal",
                "The 80/20 rule: focusing on nutrient density 80% of the time to allow for flexibility",
                "Monitoring the child's weight daily to ensure the habits are working"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sustainability relies on flexibility. The 80/20 rule prevents the 'all-or-nothing' mindset that often leads to burnout and secret eating behaviors."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A case study involving a 7-year-old 'picky eater' showed that involving the child in grocery shopping and meal prep (Food Competence) led to:",
            "options": [
                "Increased kitchen accidents and stress for the parent",
                "A 40% increase in the child's willingness to taste the foods they helped prepare",
                "No change in eating habits, but better math skills",
                "The child refusing to eat anything they didn't cook themselves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that children who participate in food preparation (the 'Helper Effect') have higher self-efficacy and are significantly more likely to try and enjoy the foods they prepared."
