            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "A 24-month-old child presents with a weight-for-age drop from the 75th percentile to the 15th percentile over four months, while length-for-age remains at the 80th percentile. According to Advanced Growth Curve Analysis, what is the most likely clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Constitutional growth delay",
                "Acute nutritional insult or 'Wasting'",
                "Chronic malnutrition or 'Stunting'",
                "Normal physiological plateauing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in weight while height (length) remains stable is characteristic of acute nutritional deficiency or 'wasting.' Stunting involves a drop in height percentiles over a longer duration."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Clinical research discussed in Lesson 2 indicates that even in the absence of anemia (Hb >11.0 g/dL), serum ferritin levels below what threshold are associated with impaired cognitive scores and executive function in toddlers?",
            "options": [
                "50 ng/mL",
                "30 ng/mL",
                "15-20 ng/mL",
                "5 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-anemic iron deficiency (NAID), defined by ferritin levels between 15-20 ng/mL, has been shown in meta-analyses to negatively impact neurodevelopment and cognitive resilience before overt anemia is detected."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "In the Pediatric Gut-Immune Axis (L3), what is the primary role of Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001 in the infant microbiome?",
            "options": [
                "Synthesizing Vitamin K1 for bone health",

                "Breaking down complex proteins like casein into amino acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "B. infantis EVC001 is specialized to consume HMOs, producing lactate and acetate which lowers intestinal pH, preventing the overgrowth of proteobacteria like E. coli and Strep."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A child who exhibits 'Tactile Defensiveness'—refusing foods with specific textures like 'mushy' or 'slimy'—is likely experiencing which sensory processing pathology related to picky eating?",
            "options": [
                "Gustatory Hyposensitivity",
                "Proprioceptive Dysfunction",
                "Oral-Sensory Hyper-reactivity",
                "Olfactory Fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oral-sensory hyper-reactivity (or tactile defensiveness) causes children to perceive normal food textures as overwhelming or noxious, leading to restrictive eating patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In the K2-D3-Calcium Triad, what is the specific function of Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7)?",

                "Synthesizing collagen fibers within the growth plate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, Vitamin K2 is required to activate osteocalcin, the protein that ensures calcium is deposited in the bones and teeth rather than soft tissues."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Which lipid combination is considered the 'Neurodevelopmental Trifecta' for optimizing myelination and synaptic plasticity in children under age 5?",
            "options": [
                "Saturated fats, MCT oil, and Vitamin E",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHA provides structural integrity, Choline acts as a precursor for acetylcholine and phospholipids, and Iodine is essential for thyroid-mediated myelination, making them the critical triad for brain development."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "According to the Behavioral Psychology of the Family Table (L7), why is 'Stealth Health' (hiding vegetables in brownies or sauces) often considered counterproductive for long-term nutritional health?",
            "options": [
                "It causes immediate allergic reactions",
                "It prevents the child from achieving sensory habituation and flavor recognition",
                "It lowers the caloric density of the meal too significantly",
                "It is illegal in most school settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hiding vegetables prevents the 10-15 neutral exposures required for a child to develop a preference for the actual taste and texture of the vegetable, maintaining the cycle of pickiness."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A Nutrition Coach identifies a 4-year-old client who frequently gags on solid foods, has a limited repertoire of only 5 foods, and is losing weight. Which referral pathway is most appropriate according to Lesson 8?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gagging on textures and a severely limited food repertoire (<15-20 foods) are red flags for pediatric feeding disorders, requiring specialized intervention from an OT or Speech Language Pathologist (SLP)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The human brain is roughly 60% fat by dry weight, necessitating high intakes of structural lipids like DHA during periods of rapid neurogenesis and myelination."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "In the context of the Satter Division of Responsibility (sDOR), what is the parent's primary role at the family table?",
