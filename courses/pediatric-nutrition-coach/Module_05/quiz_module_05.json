            "question": "When analyzing growth curves, which of the following scenarios constitutes a 'red flag' requiring clinical investigation according to WHO standards?",
            "options": [
                "A child consistently tracking on the 10th percentile for weight-for-age.",
                "A child's growth trajectory crossing two or more major percentile lines (e.g., from the 75th to the 25th).",
                "A child moving from the 50th to the 40th percentile over a 6-month period.",
                "A breastfed infant gaining weight faster than a formula-fed infant in the first 3 months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crossing two or more major percentile lines (e.g., 90th, 75th, 50th, 25th, 10th, 5th) indicates a significant shift in growth velocity and necessitates an investigation into nutritional intake, absorption, or underlying pathology."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Research on cognitive resilience indicates that even in the absence of clinical anemia (normal hemoglobin), a serum ferritin level below which threshold is associated with impaired processing speed and memory in children?",
            "options": [
                "50 ng/mL",
                "30 ng/mL",
                "12-15 ng/mL",
                "5 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Serum ferritin levels below 12-15 ng/mL indicate depleted iron stores. Studies have shown that subclinical iron deficiency (low ferritin with normal hemoglobin) still negatively impacts myelination and neurotransmitter synthesis, affecting cognitive performance."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Pediatric Gut-Immune Axis' lesson highlights that approximately what percentage of the body's total immune cells are located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut. This makes the pediatric microbiome a primary driver of systemic immune maturation and the prevention of atopic conditions."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the context of Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) and 'picky eating,' which evidence-based technique involves introducing new foods that share similar sensory characteristics (texture, temperature, or flavor) to a child's accepted 'safe' foods?",

                "The 'One Bite' Rule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Food Chaining is a therapeutic approach that builds a bridge between accepted foods and new foods by matching sensory profiles, thereby reducing the 'neophobic' response in sensory-sensitive children."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Regarding the Bone Mineralization Triad, what is the specific physiological role of Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) that distinguishes it from Vitamin D3?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the intestinal absorption of calcium.",
                "It stimulates the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH).",
                "It activates (carboxylates) osteocalcin, which binds calcium to the bone matrix.",
                "It inhibits the kidneys from excreting excess phosphorus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption into the blood, Vitamin K2 is the essential cofactor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, the protein responsible for depositing that calcium into the bone mineral matrix and keeping it out of soft tissues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline and DHA work synergistically; choline is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, which is the primary carrier for DHA into the brain tissues, particularly the hippocampus."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Parent's job is to provide 'What, When, and Where.' The Child's job is to decide 'How much and Whether' to eat, which preserves the child's internal hunger and satiety cues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coughing, 'wet' vocal quality, and respiratory issues during/after eating are classic 'red flag' symptoms of dysphagia (swallowing dysfunction) and aspiration, requiring immediate clinical evaluation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iodine is critical for thyroid hormone production, which governs myelination and neuronal migration. Even mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy and early childhood can lead to a loss of 10-15 IQ points."
