            "question": "In the neurobiology of picky eating, which brain structure is primarily responsible for the 'hyper-vigilance' and fear response associated with food neophobia?",
            "options": [
                "The Hypothalamus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Medulla Oblongata"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The amygdala processes emotional responses, particularly fear. In children with extreme picky eating or ARFID, the amygdala often exhibits a heightened response to novel food stimuli, triggering a 'fight or flight' reaction."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to a 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2, what is the recommended ratio of EPA to DHA for supporting cognitive function and reducing hyperactivity in children with ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio",
                "1:4 ratio",
                "3:1 or higher ratio of EPA to DHA",
                "DHA only, with no EPA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that higher ratios of EPA to DHA (specifically 3:1 or higher) are more effective in modulating inflammatory cytokines and supporting neurotransmitter signaling in ADHD populations."

            "question": "When assessing pediatric metabolic health, a Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio (TG/HDL) greater than which value is considered a significant predictor of insulin resistance in children?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio > 2.0 in the pediatric population is a validated surrogate marker for insulin resistance and increased risk of metabolic syndrome, often more predictive than LDL levels alone."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacterium infantis is the primary colonizer of the infant gut that specializes in fermenting HMOs, producing acetate and lactate which lowers the pH and prevents the growth of pathogenic bacteria."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adolescent athletes require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.7 g/kg) compared to sedentary peers (0.8-0.9 g/kg) to support both normal developmental growth and exercise-induced tissue repair."

                "To define the parent's role (what, when, where) and the child's role (how much, whether)",
                "To eliminate all processed sugars from the home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DoR model preserves the child's innate hunger and fullness cues by making the parent responsible for the 'provision' of food and the child responsible for the 'consumption' of food."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Up to 90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut. In neurodivergent children, dysbiosis and GI issues (like constipation) can impair neurotransmitter production, which in turn exacerbates sensory processing issues and food selectivity."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "What is the clinical significance of 'Metabolic Inflexibility' in children with high sugar diets?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to switch easily between burning glucose and burning fat",
                "The inability of the body to switch fuel sources efficiently, leading to persistent insulin elevation",
                "A physical inability to perform aerobic exercise",
                "A genetic mutation that prevents the digestion of protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic inflexibility occurs when the body becomes 'locked' into glucose metabolism due to high insulin levels, making it difficult to access stored body fat for energy, which contributes to fatigue and further sugar cravings."
