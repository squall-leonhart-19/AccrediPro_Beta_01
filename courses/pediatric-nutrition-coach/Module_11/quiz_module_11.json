            "question": "In the context of the neurobiology of picky eating, what role does the 'thalamic filter' play in Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)?",
            "options": [
                "It regulates the hunger hormones ghrelin and leptin to signal satiety.",
                "It fails to effectively gate sensory input, leading to neurological 'flooding' and a sympathetic nervous system response to new textures.",
                "It stimulates the production of dopamine when a child encounters familiar 'safe' foods.",
                "It manages the mechanical movement of the tongue during the swallowing reflex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In children with SPD or extreme picky eating, the thalamus may fail to filter out non-essential sensory information (texture, smell, sight), causing the brain to perceive new foods as a physical threat, triggering a 'fight or flight' response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that higher doses (750-1,000mg+) of Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly those with a higher EPA to DHA ratio, are necessary to achieve therapeutic effects in pediatric ADHD populations."

                "Protein intake is not a concern for adolescent athletes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To support both normal growth and the repair of muscle tissue from athletic training, adolescent athletes require 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg of body weight, significantly higher than the RDA for sedentary peers (0.8-0.9 g/kg)."

                "Avoiding peanuts until age 3 reduces the risk of allergy by 80%.",
                "Early introduction of peanuts (between 4-11 months) in high-risk infants reduced the prevalence of peanut allergy by 81%.",
                "Peanut allergies are strictly genetic and unaffected by the timing of introduction.",
                "Breastfeeding for 12 months is the only way to prevent food allergies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The LEAP study demonstrated that early, rather than delayed, introduction of allergenic proteins significantly reduces the risk of developing a permanent food allergy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weight-neutral wellness focuses on health-promoting behaviors, such as honoring internal hunger cues and improving lipid profiles, rather than focusing on a specific number on the scale."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Phthalates and Bisphenol A (BPA) are considered 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals' (EDCs). What is their primary mechanism of action in the pediatric body?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children have higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratios and sweat less efficiently than adults. For activities over 60 minutes in heat, electrolyte replacement is necessary to maintain plasma volume and prevent heat illness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Division of Responsibility (DOR) assigns leadership of the 'what, when, and where' to the parent, while giving the child autonomy over 'whether and how much' to eat, which is essential for preventing eating disorders."
