            "question": "During the peak of the adolescent growth spurt, energy requirements increase significantly. For an active 16-year-old male, what is the estimated daily caloric requirement to support both growth and activity?",
            "options": [
                "1,800 - 2,200 kcal/day",
                "2,200 - 2,600 kcal/day",
                "2,800 - 3,200 kcal/day",
                "3,800 - 4,200 kcal/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and lesson 1, active adolescent males aged 16-18 require approximately 2,800 to 3,200 calories per day to support rapid tissue synthesis and high metabolic demands during puberty."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Adolescence represents a 'critical window' for bone health. Approximately what percentage of total peak bone mass is acquired by the age of 18 in females and 20 in males?",
            "options": [
                "50%",
                "75%",
                "90%",
                "100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlights that about 90% of peak bone mass is acquired by age 18 in girls and age 20 in boys, making adequate calcium and vitamin D intake during these years vital for preventing osteoporosis later in life."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "What is the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron in adolescent females aged 14-18, and why is it higher than their male counterparts?",
            "options": [
                "11 mg; to support muscle mass development",
                "15 mg; to compensate for menstrual blood loss and expanding blood volume",
                "18 mg; to prevent adolescent-onset pica",
                "8 mg; because females have lower hemoglobin requirements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RDA for iron in females aged 14-18 is 15 mg (compared to 11 mg for males). This increased need accounts for both the rapid expansion of blood volume during growth and the iron lost during menstruation."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "A 15-year-old female athlete presents with secondary amenorrhea, low energy availability, and a history of stress fractures. Which condition should the nutrition coach immediately suspect?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RED-S (formerly known as the Female Athlete Triad) occurs when energy intake is insufficient to support the physiological functions required for health and performance, leading to hormonal disruptions and impaired bone health."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to research discussed in Lesson 5 on cognitive performance, which dietary habit is most strongly correlated with improved memory, attention, and academic grades in high schoolers?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-glycemic index breakfasts provide a steady supply of glucose to the brain, preventing the 'sugar crash' associated with high-sugar cereals and improving executive function and concentration throughout the morning."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In the context of acne and skin health (Lesson 7), which dietary factor has the strongest evidence-based link to increased sebum production and acne severity via the IGF-1 pathway?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High glycemic load diets trigger insulin spikes, which increase levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). This hormone stimulates androgen production and sebum secretion, which are primary drivers of adolescent acne."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Secretive eating and rapid disappearance of food are hallmark signs of Binge Eating Disorder or Bulimia Nervosa. The other options are typically part of normal adolescent exploration or physiological needs."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolded independence—where teens take on increasing responsibility for food selection and preparation while still having parental support—builds the self-efficacy needed for healthy eating in adulthood."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the general RDA is lower, active student-athletes require 1.2 to 1.7 g/kg of body weight to support both the growth of new tissues during puberty and the repair of muscle tissue from athletic training."
