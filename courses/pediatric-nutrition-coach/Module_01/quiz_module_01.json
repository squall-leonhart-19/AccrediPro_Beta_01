            "question": "When measuring the length of a child under the age of 24 months, which technique is required for anthropometric precision?",
            "options": [
                "Standing height using a stadiometer with shoes removed",
                "Recumbent length using a calibrated length board with a fixed headpiece and movable footpiece",
                "Recumbent length using a flexible measuring tape along the body's curves",
                "Standing height against a wall-mounted chart"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For children under 2 years (or those unable to stand independently), recumbent length must be measured using a firm, calibrated length board. Flexible tapes are inaccurate due to stretching and body curvature."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHO Growth Standards are recommended for all children from birth to 24 months, regardless of feeding type, as they describe how children should grow under optimal conditions."

            "question": "A 4-year-old client shows an upward trend in BMI-for-age, marking the beginning of 'adiposity rebound.' Why is the timing of this event clinically significant?",
            "options": [
                "Rebound before age 5.5 is linked to a significantly higher risk of obesity in adulthood",
                "Rebound after age 7 indicates a failure to thrive",
                "Early rebound is necessary for proper cognitive development",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Early adiposity rebound (occurring before age 5.5) is a known predictor of increased adiposity and metabolic risks later in life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Crossing two or more major percentile lines (e.g., dropping from the 75th to the 25th) is a primary indicator of potential growth failure or underlying medical issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "WHO Standards are prescriptive (optimal growth), while CDC References are descriptive (historical growth of US children)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Growth assessment in the GROW Method™ is about establishing the baseline and understanding the 'kinetics' or direction of growth before moving to nutritional interventions."

            "options": [
                "It is the only way to measure bone density",
                "It is a more sensitive indicator of acute malnutrition than BMI in certain clinical settings",
                "It replaces the need for weight measurements in all children",
                "It determines the child's future height potential"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MUAC is a proxy for lean body mass and is highly effective at identifying acute malnutrition (wasting), especially when weight/height measurements are difficult to obtain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Catch-up growth is characterized by an accelerated growth velocity that takes a child toward their original or predicted genetic growth curve following a period of growth inhibition."
