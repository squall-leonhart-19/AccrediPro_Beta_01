            "question": "When transitioning a child from recumbent length (lying down) to standing height at age 2, what is the expected physiological difference in measurements that practitioners must account for?",
            "options": [
                "Standing height is typically 0.5 to 1.5 cm greater than recumbent length.",
                "Recumbent length is typically 0.7 to 1.1 cm greater than standing height.",
                "There is no statistical difference if the equipment is calibrated.",
                "Standing height is 2% greater due to spinal decompression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recumbent length is consistently greater than standing height by approximately 0.7 to 1.1 cm. Failing to account for this 'drop' in the transition can lead to an erroneous interpretation of growth faltering on the growth chart."

            "question": "The WHO Growth Standards (0-24 months) differ fundamentally from the CDC Growth Charts (2-20 years) because the WHO charts are considered:",
            "options": [
                "Descriptive, showing how children in a specific region actually grew.",
                "Prescriptive, showing how children should grow under optimal conditions.",
                "Retrospective, based on formula-fed infants from the 1970s.",
                "Predictive, used solely to calculate adult height outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHO standards are prescriptive; they are based on the Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) which followed breastfed infants in optimal environments, establishing a 'gold standard' for how all children should grow regardless of ethnicity."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to growth velocity kinetics, what is the expected average weight gain for a healthy infant between the ages of 0 and 3 months?",
            "options": [
                "10–15 grams per day",

                "40–50 grams per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the first three months of life, infants experience their most rapid growth velocity, averaging 25–30 grams of weight gain per day. This slows to 15–20g/day between 3–6 months."

            "question": "A 4-year-old client presents with a BMI-for-age that has begun to rise sharply after a period of decline. This phenomenon is known as 'Adiposity Rebound.' What is the clinical significance of this occurring before age 5.5?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a healthy surge in muscle mass development.",
                "It is a normal physiological variation with no long-term risk.",
                "It is a strong predictor of increased risk for obesity and metabolic syndrome in adulthood.",
                "It suggests the child is entering an early puberty phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Early adiposity rebound (occurring before age 5.5) is a significant clinical red flag. Research shows a strong correlation between early rebound and a significantly higher risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life."

                "A child's weight remains at the 25th percentile for two consecutive visits.",
                "A child's height-for-age increases from the 50th to the 55th percentile.",
                "A child's growth curve crosses two or more major percentile lines (e.g., 75th to 25th).",
                "A child's BMI-for-age is at the 60th percentile."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Crossing two or more major percentile lines (such as moving from the 75th to the 25th) is a primary indicator of growth faltering or 'Failure to Thrive' and necessitates a comprehensive clinical evaluation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Growth Assessment phase in the GROW Method™ provides the objective biological baseline. It allows the coach to see the 'story' of the child's growth and determine if the current nutritional status is supporting their genetic potential."

            "explanation": "For children aged 2–20, a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 95th percentiles is classified as 'Overweight.' The 95th percentile and above is classified as 'Obese.'"

            "options": [
                "It is the most accurate way to measure bone density.",
                "It remains relatively stable between ages 1 and 5, making it a sensitive indicator of acute wasting.",
                "It is used to calculate the child's predicted adult height.",
                "It is more accurate than BMI for infants under 6 months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MUAC is a proxy for muscle and fat stores. Because it changes very little in healthy children between 12 and 60 months, a low MUAC is a highly specific indicator of acute malnutrition or wasting."

            "question": "Case Study: Leo (18 months) was born at the 50th percentile for weight. At 12 months, he was at the 40th. Today, he is at the 5th percentile. His length remains at the 45th percentile. What is the most likely interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Constitutional growth delay (late bloomer).",
                "Acute nutritional deficit or 'wasting' (Weight-for-Length discrepancy).",
                "Chronic malnutrition affecting linear growth (stunting).",
                "Normal growth deceleration expected in the second year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Since Leo's weight has dropped significantly (crossing multiple percentiles) while his length remains stable, this indicates acute nutritional deficit or wasting. If his length had also dropped, it would suggest a more chronic, long-term issue (stunting)."
