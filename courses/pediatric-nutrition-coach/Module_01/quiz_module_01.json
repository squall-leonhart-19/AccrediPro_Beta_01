            "question": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC clinical guidelines, which growth charts must be used for children from birth to 24 months of age?",
            "options": [
                "CDC Growth Charts (2000)",
                "WHO Growth Standard Charts",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CDC and AAP recommend using the WHO growth standards for all infants from birth to 24 months because they describe growth under optimal environmental conditions and use breastfed infants as the norm."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A 6-month-old infant is being assessed for 'readiness' for complementary foods. Which developmental milestone is considered a mandatory physiological prerequisite?",
            "options": [
                "The appearance of the first primary incisor",
                "The ability to crawl at least 3 feet",
                "The disappearance of the extrusion (tongue-thrust) reflex",
                "The ability to sleep 8 consecutive hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The disappearance of the extrusion reflex is a critical developmental milestone that allows the infant to safely swallow non-liquid foods without automatically pushing them out of the mouth."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Regarding pediatric anatomy, how does the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) of a newborn compare to that of a mature adult per kilogram of body weight?",
            "options": [
                "The infant BMR is approximately 50% lower than an adult's.",
                "The infant BMR is roughly equal to an adult's.",
                "The infant BMR is approximately 2x higher than an adult's.",
                "The infant BMR is approximately 5x higher than an adult's."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infants have a significantly higher BMR (approx. 50-55 kcal/kg/day) compared to adults (approx. 25-30 kcal/kg/day) due to the high metabolic demands of rapid growth and a larger surface-area-to-mass ratio."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the context of the pediatric microbiome, what is the primary role of Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) in the infant's gut?",
            "options": [
                "They provide the primary source of glucose for brain development.",
                "They act as prebiotics to specifically nourish Bifidobacterium infantis.",
                "They catalyze the breakdown of complex proteins in the stomach.",
                "They facilitate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A and D."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HMOs are indigestible by the infant but serve as a selective prebiotic for beneficial bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium species, which help program the developing immune system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 40-45% of total adult bone mass is accumulated during the short window of adolescence, making this a 'critical period' for calcium and vitamin D optimization."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which endocrine hormone, primarily synthesized in the liver, serves as the principal mediator of Growth Hormone (GH) and is used as a clinical marker for nutritional status?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IGF-1 is the primary mediator of the effects of Growth Hormone. Because its levels are sensitive to protein and energy intake, it is often used to assess growth disorders and nutritional recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The brain undergoes a massive growth explosion in early life, reaching roughly 80% of its adult weight by age 2, highlighting the importance of neuro-supportive nutrients like DHA and Iron during this window."

                "Normal growth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Weight-for-Height Z-score below -2 is the clinical definition for 'wasting' (acute malnutrition), whereas 'stunting' (chronic malnutrition) refers to a Height-for-Age Z-score below -2."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "What is the clinical significance of a child 'crossing percentiles' (e.g., dropping from the 50th to the 5th percentile) on a growth chart over a 3-month period?",
            "options": [
                "It is a normal variation known as 'catch-down' growth.",
                "It indicates the child is transitioning to a more efficient metabolism.",
                "It is a clinical red flag for potential 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) and requires investigation.",
                "It suggests the child has reached their genetic height potential early."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Crossing two or more major percentile lines downward is a primary diagnostic indicator for growth faltering or Failure to Thrive (FTT), necessitating a thorough nutritional and medical evaluation."
