            "question": "Which of the following best distinguishes a Non-IgE mediated food allergy, such as Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), from a classic IgE-mediated allergy?",
            "options": [
                "FPIES causes immediate anaphylaxis within seconds of ingestion.",
                "FPIES symptoms are typically delayed by 2-6 hours and primarily involve the gastrointestinal tract.",
                "IgE-mediated allergies are diagnosed exclusively via skin prick testing, while FPIES uses hair analysis.",
                "Non-IgE mediated reactions do not involve the immune system, whereas IgE reactions do."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike IgE-mediated allergies which present with immediate hives or respiratory distress, Non-IgE mediated reactions like FPIES involve a delayed immune response (2-6 hours) characterized by profuse vomiting and diarrhea."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacterium infantis is uniquely equipped with the enzymes necessary to break down HMOs, which helps establish a protective gut barrier and trains the developing pediatric immune system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent children often seek specific textures (like crunch) to provide proprioceptive feedback to the jaw or avoid 'mushy' textures due to tactile defensiveness in the oral cavity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Acanthosis Nigricans, typically found on the neck or axilla, is a dermatological marker of high circulating insulin levels and is a key red flag for metabolic syndrome in children."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children are at higher risk because they consume more calories and fluids relative to their body mass and have developing organ systems that are highly sensitive to hormonal interference."

                "Focusing on BMI in every consultation is the most effective way to prevent weight stigma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight stigma creates significant psychosocial stress, which elevates cortisol and often leads to maladaptive eating patterns, actually worsening metabolic health outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Children sweat more profusely, leading to rapid electrolyte loss.",
                "Children have a lower surface-area-to-mass ratio.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children possess fewer active sweat glands and produce less sweat per gland than adults, making them less efficient at evaporative cooling and more prone to overheating."
