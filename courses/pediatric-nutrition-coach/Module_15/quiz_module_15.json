            "question": "Which characteristic distinguishes Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), a non-IgE mediated allergy, from a classic IgE-mediated food allergy?",
            "options": [
                "Symptoms like hives and swelling appear within minutes of ingestion.",
                "It typically results in a positive skin prick test (SPT).",
                "It presents with delayed gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting/diarrhea) 2–4 hours after ingestion.",
                "It is primarily treated with an epinephrine auto-injector as the first line of defense."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FPIES is a non-IgE mediated allergy characterized by profuse, delayed vomiting and diarrhea, often leading to dehydration. Unlike IgE-mediated allergies, skin tests are usually negative and epinephrine is not the primary treatment for the GI distress."

            "question": "Why is Bifidobacterium infantis considered a 'keystone species' in the development of the infant gut-immune axis?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only bacteria that can digest gluten in the infant gut.",
                "It possesses the enzymatic machinery to specifically metabolize Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs).",
                "It prevents the absorption of excess Vitamin D in formula-fed infants.",
                "It produces high levels of cortisol to help the infant manage stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "B. infantis is uniquely evolved to consume the complex glycans (HMOs) in breast milk, which helps lower gut pH and prevents the colonization of pathogens, thereby training the early immune system."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the context of Neurodiversity, a child with ASD who strictly prefers 'beige foods' (bread, crackers, plain pasta) is most likely seeking which sensory outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased olfactory stimulation from bland scents.",
                "Predictability in texture and a lower sensory 'surprise' threshold.",

                "A method to decrease dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many children with ASD or ADHD have sensory processing sensitivities. Highly processed 'beige' foods provide a consistent, predictable sensory experience (texture, taste, and crunch) that reduces the anxiety associated with the sensory variability of whole foods like fruit or vegetables."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "According to Lesson 4 on Metabolic Health, which surrogate marker is highly predictive of insulin resistance in pediatric populations when fasting insulin tests are unavailable?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high TG/HDL ratio is a validated clinical marker in pediatrics that correlates strongly with insulin resistance and increased risk for metabolic syndrome."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known to interfere with androgen signaling, which can impact pubertal timing and reproductive health in both males and females."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "For a young athlete involved in high-intensity exercise lasting over 60 minutes, what is the recommended carbohydrate concentration in a sports drink to optimize gastric emptying and absorption?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 6-8% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution is the 'gold standard' for sports nutrition as it maximizes fluid absorption and provides fuel without causing the gastrointestinal distress associated with higher concentrations."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 7 regarding weight stigma indicates that children who experience weight-based teasing are how much more likely to engage in binge eating as adults?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies, such as Project EAT, show that weight-based teasing in childhood is a significant predictor of disordered eating and binge eating behaviors, with risks increasing by over 60%."

                "Consuming it with a high-phytate bran muffin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption because it reduces ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous form and prevents the formation of insoluble iron complexes."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "The 'Hygiene Hypothesis' (or 'Old Friends' Hypothesis) suggests that the modern increase in pediatric autoimmune and allergic diseases is partially due to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hypothesis posits that a lack of early childhood exposure to symbiotic microorganisms and parasites increases susceptibility to allergic diseases by suppressing the natural development of the immune system."

            "question": "A 10-year-old client with ADHD experiences significant 'rebound' irritability and loss of focus 90 minutes after a breakfast of sugary cereal. What is the most likely nutritional mechanism?",

                "Chronic dehydration from lack of water intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-glycemic breakfasts cause a rapid rise in blood glucose and a subsequent insulin spike, which can lead to reactive (postprandial) hypoglycemia. In neurodivergent children, this drop in blood sugar can manifest as heightened irritability and cognitive 'fog'."
