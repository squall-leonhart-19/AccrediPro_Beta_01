            "question": "When interpreting anthropometric data, a Z-score of -2.5 for height-for-age in a 4-year-old child is clinically classified as which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Normal growth variation",
                "Moderate stunting (chronic malnutrition)",
                "Severe stunting (chronic malnutrition)",
                "Acute wasting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to WHO standards, a Z-score below -2 indicates moderate stunting, while a Z-score below -3 indicates severe stunting. However, in clinical practice, any score below -2 is the threshold for stunting, and -2.5 represents a significant deviation requiring immediate intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio >2.0 in children is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance and is highly correlated with the development of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)."
