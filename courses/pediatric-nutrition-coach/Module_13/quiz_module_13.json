            "question": "A parent expresses frustration, stating, 'We've tried every vegetable and he just spits them out.' Using Motivational Interviewing (MI), which 'Reflective Listening' response best targets the parent's underlying emotion to build rapport?",
            "options": [
                "You feel exhausted because you've put in so much effort without seeing the results you expected.",
                "Have you tried roasting the vegetables with a bit of olive oil and sea salt?",
                "Actually, research shows it takes 15-20 exposures for a child to accept a new food.",
                "It sounds like you need to be more firm with your boundaries during mealtime."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening in MI involves mirroring the emotional content of the client's statement. Validating the parent's exhaustion builds the therapeutic alliance and reduces resistance before moving toward solutions."

            "question": "According to the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), if a family is in the 'Contemplation' stage regarding reducing sugary beverage intake, what is the coach's primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a specific 7-day meal plan with water-only options.",
                "Helping the family tip the 'decisional balance' by exploring the pros and cons of change.",
                "Setting a 'quit date' for all soda and juice consumption.",
                "Teaching the family how to read nutrition labels for hidden sugars."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Contemplation stage, clients are aware of the problem but ambivalent about change. The coach's role is to help them resolve this ambivalence by weighing the benefits of change against the costs of staying the same."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "When coaching an adolescent (ages 13-18) on nutritional habits, which developmental need is most critical to address to ensure long-term adherence?",
            "options": [
                "The need for concrete, black-and-white rules about 'good' and 'bad' foods.",
                "The need for parental supervision during every meal and snack.",
                "The need for autonomy and perceived competence in making their own choices.",
                "The need for sensory-based play to encourage food exploration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adolescents are in a stage of developing identity and autonomy. Coaching strategies that empower the teen to lead the goal-setting process are significantly more effective than top-down, parent-driven approaches."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Rolling with Resistance,' how should a coach respond when a parent says, 'My mother-in-law feeds him candy every day, so there's no point in me even trying to cook healthy'?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the parent they must set a strict boundary with the mother-in-law immediately.",
                "Explain that the mother-in-law's actions are undermining the child's metabolic health.",
                "Use a double-sided reflection to acknowledge the external barrier while highlighting the parent's desire for change.",
                "Advise the parent to stop visiting the mother-in-law until the child's habits improve."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A double-sided reflection (e.g., 'On one hand, you feel frustrated that your mother-in-law's choices are out of your control, and on the other hand, you really want to provide the best nutrition possible for your son') acknowledges the reality of the barrier without agreeing that change is impossible."

            "options": [
                "The application of the same caloric restriction to every child in the group.",
                "The realization among parents that they are not alone in their struggles, which reduces shame.",
                "The use of standardized global nutrition guidelines across all cultures.",
                "The tendency for group members to adopt the same personality traits over time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universalization is a therapeutic factor in group coaching where members realize their problems are not unique. This reduces the isolation and 'parental guilt' that often inhibits behavior change."

                "The first minute of a session dedicated to non-clinical, person-centered connection.",
                "Ensuring the client speaks for at least 60 seconds before the coach interrupts.",
                "The minute at the end of the session used to process the digital payment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Minute' is a rapport-building technique in telehealth where the coach focuses entirely on the client's well-being and environment (e.g., asking about a pet in the background) to bridge the digital gap before diving into the agenda."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Which approach best demonstrates 'Cultural Humility' when working with a family whose traditional diet is high in refined carbohydrates that conflict with standard guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a list of 'healthier' Western alternatives to replace their traditional foods.",
                "Explaining why their traditional diet is contributing to the child's health issues.",
                "Collaborating with the family to find ways to incorporate traditional flavors while adjusting portions or preparation methods.",
                "Ignoring the cultural foods and focusing only on adding new, approved vegetables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility involves a collaborative process where the coach respects the client's cultural heritage as an asset, working within their framework rather than imposing a Western-centric 'correct' way of eating."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In family conflict resolution, what is the primary danger of 'Triangulation' during a nutrition coaching session?",

                "It involves three different coaches working with one family, causing confusion.",
                "The coach and one parent 'gang up' on the other parent, or a child is pulled into a parental dispute.",
                "The family focuses on three different goals at once, leading to a plateau.",
                "It refers to the three-step process of identifying a problem, arguing, and then resolving it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation occurs when a third person (often the child or the coach) is brought into a conflict between two others to deflect tension. This is counterproductive and can make the child feel responsible for the family's nutritional 'success' or 'failure.'"

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study on digital coaching efficacy (n=450) suggested that 'Screen Fatigue' in pediatric sessions can be mitigated by which of the following?",

                "Increasing session length to 90 minutes to ensure all topics are covered.",
                "Using 'active' components like virtual kitchen tours or 'show and tell' with food items.",
                "Turning off the camera and using audio-only communication for every session.",
                "Requiring the child to sit perfectly still in front of the camera for the duration of the call."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interactive and 'active' telehealth strategies prevent the passive 'zoning out' associated with screen fatigue. Virtual kitchen tours and hands-on activities keep children and parents engaged in the digital environment."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "When a family reaches a 'Behavioral Plateau' where progress has stalled for 4+ weeks, what is the most effective 'Advanced Coaching' first step?",

                "Increasing the intensity of the goals to 'jumpstart' the system.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A plateau often indicates that the initial strategies have been 'maxed out' or that new barriers have emerged. A functional assessment helps identify what is currently maintaining the old behaviors despite the family's previous success."
