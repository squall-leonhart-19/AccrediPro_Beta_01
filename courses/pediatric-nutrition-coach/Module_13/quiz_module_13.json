            "question": "When performing an Advanced Anthropometric Analysis, which finding is the most clinically significant indicator of potential 'failure to thrive' or growth failure in a child over 2 years of age?",
            "options": [
                "A single measurement below the 5th percentile for height-for-age.",
                "A downward crossing of two or more major percentile lines on the growth chart.",
                "A BMI-for-age at the 85th percentile.",
                "A growth velocity of 5cm per year during mid-childhood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a single low measurement is a data point, the 'velocity' or trend is more critical. Crossing two or more major percentile lines (e.g., 75th to 25th) indicates a significant deviation from the child's established growth trajectory and requires immediate clinical investigation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70-80% of the entire immune system is located in the gut. This highlights the critical role of the pediatric microbiome and intestinal barrier integrity in systemic immune health and the development of atopic conditions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'First Hit' is the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver (steatosis), which is primarily driven by insulin resistance and high fructose intake. The 'Second Hit' involves oxidative stress and inflammation that progresses the condition to NASH."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adolescent athletes require higher protein than sedentary peers to cover both the demands of puberty/growth and athletic recovery. 1.2 to 1.7 g/kg/day is the evidence-based range for this population."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While picky eaters may be selective, ARFID is a clinical diagnosis characterized by significant functional impairment, such as failure to meet energy/nutritional needs, significant weight loss, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning."
