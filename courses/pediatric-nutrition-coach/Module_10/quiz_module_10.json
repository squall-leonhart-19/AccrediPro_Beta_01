            "question": "A 4-year-old child is exhibiting 'food jag' behavior. According to the portion size guidelines in Lesson 1, what is the standard recommended serving size for a single food group (like cooked vegetables) for this child?",

                "1/2 cup",
                "4 tablespoons (1 tablespoon per year of age)",

                "6 tablespoons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Thumb' for preschooler portion sizes is approximately 1 tablespoon of each food group per year of age. For a 4-year-old, this equals 4 tablespoons."

            "question": "Which long-chain omega-3 fatty acid is most critical for supporting the structural integrity of the brain and improving focus and cognitive performance in school-age children?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)",
                "Oleic acid",
                "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)",
                "Linoleic acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHA is a primary structural component of the human brain and retina. Studies show that adequate DHA levels are linked to better concentration and memory in school-aged children."

            "question": "To effectively combat the 'after-school slump' and prevent reactive hypoglycemia, a snack should ideally combine which two components?",
            "options": [
                "Fiber-rich carbohydrates and lean protein/healthy fats",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Combining fiber-rich carbohydrates with protein or fats slows digestion and the release of glucose into the bloodstream, providing stable energy rather than a spike and crash."

            "question": "For a 10-year-old child athlete participating in a 60-minute vigorous sports activity, what is the recommended hydration protocol to prevent performance-limiting dehydration?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking only when the child reports feeling thirsty",
                "Consumption of 500ml of a caffeinated energy drink before the game",

                "2 liters of water immediately after the activity ends"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children have a higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratio and are more susceptible to heat. Periodic hydration (150-250ml every 20 mins) is safer and more effective than waiting for thirst."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequent snacking on fermentable carbohydrates keeps the mouth's pH low (acidic) for longer periods, preventing remineralization and increasing the risk of dental caries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that restrictive feeding practices often backfire, leading to increased 'eating in the absence of hunger' and a fixation on the restricted items."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A 7-year-old child is frequently irritable and unable to focus on homework at 4:00 PM. Which 'bridge snack' would best support their metabolic needs?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hummus (protein/fat) and carrots/pita (fiber/complex carbs) provide the necessary nutrient density to stabilize blood sugar and support cognitive function."

                "Implementing a strict 'no-sugar' policy for the child only",
                "Shifting the focus from weight to health-promoting behaviors for the whole family",
                "Encouraging the child to exercise as a punishment for overeating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A weight-neutral, health-behavior-focused approach reduces stigma and promotes sustainable lifestyle changes without damaging the child's self-esteem."
