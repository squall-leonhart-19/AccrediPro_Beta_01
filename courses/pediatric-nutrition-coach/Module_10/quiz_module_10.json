            "question": "A 14-year-old competitive soccer player presents with fatigue and decreased performance. According to pediatric sports nutrition guidelines, what is the 'gold standard' for calculating fluid replacement needs during high-intensity training?",
            "options": [
                "A fixed rate of 500ml per hour of activity",
                "Pre- and post-exercise weight measurement (1L per 1kg lost)",
                "Thirst-driven intake only to prevent hyponatremia",
                "Consuming 150ml of a 12% carbohydrate solution every 15 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To ensure accurate rehydration, young athletes should aim to replace 1 liter of fluid for every 1 kilogram of body weight lost during exercise. Thirst is often a delayed indicator of dehydration in children."

            "question": "Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE mediated allergy. Which clinical presentation is most characteristic of an acute FPIES reaction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FPIES is characterized by delayed gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea) occurring 1-4 hours after ingestion, unlike IgE-mediated reactions which are typically immediate and involve the skin or respiratory system."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In the nutritional management of ADHD and ASD, a 2022 meta-analysis highlighted the role of the 'Gut-Brain Axis.' Which intervention showed a moderate effect size in improving 'Hyperactivity' scores in neurodiverse children?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Adiposity rebound usually occurs around age 6. When it occurs before age 5 (Early Adiposity Rebound), it is a strong predictor of metabolic syndrome and obesity in later life."

                "The elimination phase is not recommended for children under 18"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In pediatrics, the Low-FODMAP elimination phase is strictly limited to 2-6 weeks to avoid nutritional deficiencies and the development of disordered eating patterns, followed by a systematic reintroduction."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "A child is diagnosed with 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) due to inadequate caloric intake. If the goal is 'Catch-up Growth,' what is the standard clinical formula for calculating the required energy (kcal) intake?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The catch-up growth formula uses the RDA for the child's 'weight age' (the age at which their current weight would be the 50th percentile) multiplied by the ideal weight for their current height, divided by their actual weight."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A 10-year-old athlete training 15 hours per week is at risk for 'Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S). Which of the following is a primary clinical sign of RED-S in a pediatric patient?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RED-S occurs when energy intake is insufficient to support both training and physiological function, leading to impaired bone health (stress fractures), hormonal imbalances, and growth suppression."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "For a child with a confirmed Peanut Allergy, the 'Oral Immunotherapy' (OIT) approach aims to achieve 'desensitization.' What does this term specifically mean in a clinical setting?",

                "The child can tolerate a specific 'maintenance dose' of peanut protein to prevent anaphylaxis upon accidental exposure",
                "The child's skin prick test will now show a 0mm wheal",
                "The child no longer produces IgE antibodies against peanuts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Desensitization means the child has a higher threshold for reaction while on therapy, providing a 'safety net' against accidental exposure, but it does not necessarily mean a permanent cure (remission)."
