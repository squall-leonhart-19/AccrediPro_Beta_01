            "question": "Growth faltering (Failure to Thrive) is clinically defined by a downward deviation in growth where a child's weight-for-age drops across how many major percentile lines?",
            "options": [
                "One major percentile line",
                "Two major percentile lines",
                "Three major percentile lines",
                "Five major percentile lines",
                "Two major percentile lines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Failure to Thrive (FTT) or growth faltering is typically identified when a child's weight-for-age crosses two or more major percentile lines (e.g., from the 50th to below the 10th) on standardized growth charts."

            "question": "According to the 2019 consensus definition by Goday et al., which of the following is NOT one of the four functional domains used to diagnose Pediatric Feeding Disorder (PFD)?",
            "options": [
                "Medical dysfunction",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The four domains of PFD are Medical, Nutritional, Feeding Skill, and Psychosocial. While cognitive issues may coexist, they are not one of the four diagnostic domains defined in the consensus."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "During an acute inflammatory flare (e.g., Crohn’s Disease), pediatric protein requirements can increase significantly to support tissue repair. What is the recommended range during these crises?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In acute illness or inflammatory flares, protein needs often rise to 1.5–2.0 g/kg per day to counteract catabolism and support the immune response and mucosal healing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory over-responsivity involves an exaggerated response to sensory stimuli (textures, smells, or colors), often leading to a very restricted repertoire of 'safe' foods."

            "id": "q28_5",

                "Occasional picky eating behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medical instability in EOED is often marked by physiological signs of starvation, including severe bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm), orthostatic hypotension, or hypothermia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Refeeding syndrome is characterized by a rapid shift of electrolytes from the blood into the cells. Hypophosphatemia is the hallmark sign, along with potential drops in potassium and magnesium."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Families with limited budgets often purchase shelf-stable, calorie-dense foods (high in fats and sugars) because they are cheaper and more satiating than fresh, nutrient-dense options."

                "ARFID involves significant weight loss",
                "ARFID involves a lack of distress regarding body shape or weight",
                "ARFID only occurs in children under age 5",
                "ARFID is always caused by a medical gastrointestinal condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike Anorexia Nervosa, individuals with ARFID do not restrict food intake due to body image dissatisfaction or a fear of gaining weight; their restriction is based on sensory issues, fear of aversive consequences, or lack of interest in eating."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutamine is the primary fuel for enterocytes (gut cells) and lymphocytes. During major physiological stress or surgery, the body's demand for glutamine exceeds its ability to produce it."
