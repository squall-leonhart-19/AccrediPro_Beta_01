            "options": [
                "Weight-for-age falling below the 10th percentile once",
                "A child's weight crossing two or more major centile lines downward on a growth chart",

                "A BMI-for-age consistently at the 50th percentile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Growth faltering is clinically defined by a downward trend where a child crosses two or more major centiles (e.g., from the 75th to the 25th) on standardized growth charts, indicating a deviation from their established growth trajectory."

            "question": "In the context of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), which subtype is specifically characterized by a lack of interest in eating or low appetite, rather than sensory aversion?",
            "options": [
                "Sensory Sensitivity subtype",
                "Fear of Aversive Consequences subtype",

                "Body Image Distortion subtype"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ARFID is categorized into three main presentations: Sensory Sensitivity (picky eating), Fear of Aversive Consequences (choking/vomiting fears), and Apparent Lack of Interest (low drive to eat). ARFID does not involve body image distortion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pediatric patients in acute inflammatory flares require significantly higher protein (2.0-2.5 g/kg) to manage the metabolic demands of inflammation and prevent lean muscle mass wasting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological markers of instability in EOED include severe bradycardia (HR < 50 bpm), orthostatic hypotension, or electrolyte imbalances, all of which require urgent medical stabilization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The shift from catabolism to anabolism causes a massive intracellular movement of phosphorus, leading to severe hypophosphatemia, which can cause cardiac or respiratory failure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To encourage oral intake, clinicians typically reduce the volume of tube feeds (often starting with nocturnal cycles) to allow the child to experience natural hunger cues while maintaining safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Hunger Vital Sign focuses on the worry about food running out and the inability to afford balanced meals. Positive responses to either indicate food insecurity."
