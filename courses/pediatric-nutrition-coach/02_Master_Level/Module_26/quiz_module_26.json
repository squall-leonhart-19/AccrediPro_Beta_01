            "question": "In the G.R.O.W. Method™ architecture, what is the primary objective of the 'G' (Growth Assessment) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To set weight loss goals for pediatric obesity",
                "To establish a physiological and developmental baseline using anthropometric and biochemical data",
                "To provide immediate meal plans for picky eaters",
                "To market the program to new potential clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'G' phase focuses on Advanced Growth Assessment, which involves establishing a comprehensive baseline of the child's current health, growth velocity, and nutritional status before intervention begins."

            "question": "A coach observes a child's growth chart and notices a drop from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile in weight-for-age over four months. According to Lesson 2, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "It is a normal fluctuation during growth spurts",
                "It is a 'red flag' indicating a crossing of two major percentile lines, requiring immediate clinical investigation",
                "The child is simply becoming leaner and more athletic",
                "No action is needed unless the child drops below the 5th percentile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crossing two or more major percentile lines (e.g., 75th to 50th to 25th) is a significant clinical indicator of potential growth faltering or nutritional inadequacy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food Chaining is an evidence-based remediation strategy that uses the sensory properties of 'safe' foods to gradually introduce new, similar foods, reducing the fear of new textures or flavors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Optimization roadmaps focus on performance; Omega-3s and phospholipids are critical structural components of neuronal membranes and are linked to improved focus and cognitive processing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved through clear boundaries. The Division of Responsibility (Satter model) reduces mealtime power struggles and fosters long-term healthy eating behaviors."

            "question": "When customizing programs for neurodivergent populations (Lesson 6), why must a coach prioritize GI health assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Because neurodivergent children never have food aversions",
                "Statistics show that children with ASD are up to 4 times more likely to experience GI symptoms than neurotypical peers",
                "GI health is unrelated to behavior in neurodivergent children",
                "To ensure the child loses weight rapidly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a high prevalence of GI distress in ASD populations (up to 84% in some studies), which can significantly impact behavior, sleep, and nutrient absorption."

                "The client paying their monthly invoice",
                "A lack of progress in objective metrics (e.g., no change in food variety) after 14-21 days of consistent implementation",
                "The coach wanting to try a new supplement they just read about",
                "The child turning a year older"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Program iteration should be data-driven. If objective metrics (like food logs or symptom trackers) show no improvement despite consistency, the protocol must be adjusted."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In the scaling of a professional pediatric practice (Lesson 8), what is the primary advantage of 'Group Coaching' over '1-on-1' delivery?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to work fewer hours for the same revenue",
                "It provides 'Social Modeling' and peer support, which can reduce parental stress and isolation",
                "It eliminates the need for any individual assessment",
                "It is only effective for infants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While group coaching is more scalable, its primary clinical benefit in pediatrics is the community aspect, where parents learn from each other's challenges and successes."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A 6-year-old athlete requires an 'Optimization Roadmap' for performance. Which 'Metric' is most relevant to monitor in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "The child's 100m sprint time only",
                "Recovery markers, hydration status, and sustained energy levels during practice",
                "Total weight lost during the season",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pediatric performance optimization focuses on health markers like recovery and energy maintenance rather than just competitive outcomes, ensuring the child isn't overtrained or undernourished."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "A coach is moving a client from 'Remediation' to 'Optimization.' What level of foundational habit consistency is generally recommended before making this transition?",

                "10% consistency",
                "50% consistency",
                "At least 80% consistency in core habits (e.g., protein intake, hydration, sleep)",
                "Consistency does not matter for optimization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'O' phase (Optimization) is built upon a stable 'R' (Remediation) foundation. Attempting to optimize performance without ~80% consistency in basic nutrition usually leads to program failure."
