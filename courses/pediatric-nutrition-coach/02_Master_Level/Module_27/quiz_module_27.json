            "question": "In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), 'selective eating' is often driven by sensory processing differences. According to clinical data, what is the most common micronutrient deficiency observed in this population due to limited food repertoire?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Iron",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that up to 70% of children with ASD exhibit atypical eating behaviors, with iron deficiency being the most prevalent micronutrient concern due to the frequent rejection of meat and high-texture proteins."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S occurs when low energy availability impairs physiological functions, including bone health and metabolic rate. Stress fractures and chronic fatigue are hallmark indicators in adolescent athletes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "OIT aims for desensitization, raising the 'threshold' amount of an allergen a child can tolerate before reacting, thereby reducing the risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis from cross-contamination."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that EEN (using liquid formula as the sole nutrition source for 6-8 weeks) induces remission in 75-85% of pediatric cases, providing a steroid-sparing alternative that supports mucosal healing."

            "question": "A child with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is planning to participate in a 60-minute vigorous soccer match. To prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia, what is the standard recommendation for carbohydrate intake?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For vigorous activity lasting an hour, consuming 15-30g of carbohydrates per 30-60 minutes of activity is standard practice to maintain blood glucose stability in pediatric T1D patients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sudden, rigid elimination of macronutrient groups and an obsession with 'clean eating' or weight are primary psychosocial indicators of an emerging eating disorder (like Anorexia or Orthorexia) in youth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
