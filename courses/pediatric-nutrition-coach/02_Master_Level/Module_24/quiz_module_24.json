            "question": "When performing an Advanced Clinical Assessment, which indicator is considered the most sensitive for detecting acute nutritional changes before they manifest as a significant drop in weight-for-age percentiles?",
            "options": [
                "Height-for-age Z-score (HAZ)",
                "Weight Velocity (g/day or kg/month)",
                "Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) alone",
                "Head circumference-for-age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight velocity allows for the detection of growth faltering in real-time. A 2021 study highlighted that velocity changes often precede percentile crossings by weeks, making it a critical 'Master Practitioner' metric for early intervention."

        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Behavioral Remediation for ARFID, how does 'Fear of Aversive Consequences' typically differ from 'Sensory Sensitivity'?",
            "options": [
                "It is driven by a lack of hunger cues and low metabolic demand.",
                "It is characterized by a sudden onset following a traumatic event like choking or vomiting.",
                "It is exclusively found in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",
                "It requires high-intensity sensory integration therapy rather than cognitive restructuring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While sensory-based ARFID is often lifelong and texture-specific, fear of aversive consequences usually has an identifiable trigger (e.g., a choking episode) and requires a trauma-informed exposure approach."

        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A 4-year-old client presents with fatigue and irritability. Labs show Hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL (normal) but a Serum Ferritin of 14 ng/mL. How should a Master Practitioner interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "The child is healthy as Hemoglobin is within the reference range.",
                "The child has Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA).",
                "The child has Non-Anemic Iron Deficiency (NAID) which can still impair cognitive function.",
                "The Ferritin is likely elevated due to acute inflammation (CRP should be checked)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-Anemic Iron Deficiency (Ferritin <15-20 ng/mL with normal Hb) is often overlooked but is associated with significant neurocognitive and behavioral issues in pediatric populations."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Thrifty Phenotype' hypothesis in Epigenetics, what is a primary risk for a fetus experiencing intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)?",
            "options": [
                "Permanent downregulation of insulin receptors leading to increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes later in life.",
                "An increased metabolic rate that persists through adolescence.",
                "Resistance to obesity regardless of postnatal caloric intake.",
                "Enhanced detoxification pathways for environmental pollutants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Thrifty Phenotype hypothesis suggests that fetal nutritional thrift leads to permanent metabolic adaptations (like insulin resistance) that become maladaptive in an environment of postnatal nutritional abundance."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In Family Systems Theory, which term describes a state where boundaries between family members are blurred, often leading to a child taking on the parent's anxiety regarding food?",

                "Homeostasis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Enmeshment occurs when individual boundaries are weak, causing the child to mirror parental stress, which often manifests as psychosomatic feeding refusal or extreme pickiness."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "When managing a complex case with multi-morbidity (e.g., Cerebral Palsy, GERD, and Faltering Growth), what is the practitioner's first priority in the hierarchy of intervention?",

                "Beginning intensive behavioral feeding therapy for texture progression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners follow a hierarchy of needs; physiological stability (calories/hydration) and safety must be established before addresssing complex behavioral or micronutrient goals."

            "options": [
                "A practitioner who only treats 'Tier 1' (low complexity) cases.",
                "A specialist who refuses to collaborate outside their specific niche.",
                "A practitioner with deep expertise in nutrition (the vertical bar) and broad ability to collaborate across disciplines (the horizontal bar).",
                "A practitioner who focuses exclusively on Testosterone and Thyroid markers in pediatric labs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T-shaped professionals possess deep functional knowledge but understand enough about speech therapy, OT, and pediatrics to collaborate effectively within a care team."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "What is a key characteristic of 'Outcome-Based Coaching' compared to traditional advice-giving?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the practitioner's clinical goals for the child.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Outcome-based coaching focuses on the 'how'—using lead measures (like 'offering one new food 3x/week') to achieve the desired clinical outcome (weight gain or expanded variety)."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A case study involving a child with sensory-based food refusal shows they are stuck in the 'Exploring' phase of the SOS (Sequential Oral Sensory) hierarchy. What is the next logical step?",
            "options": [
                "Force-feeding the child to ensure caloric density.",
                "Moving to 'Touching' the food with hands, then to the face/lips.",
                "Skipping to 'Chewing and Swallowing' using rewards.",
                "Eliminating all sensory play to focus on table manners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SOS approach is a systematic desensitization program. If a child is exploring (looking/smelling), the next step is tactile interaction (touching) before moving toward the mouth."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that high protein intake in the first 2 years of life is associated with which epigenetic outcome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Early Protein Hypothesis' suggests that high protein intake (often from formula) triggers higher Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes adipogenesis and long-term obesity risk."
