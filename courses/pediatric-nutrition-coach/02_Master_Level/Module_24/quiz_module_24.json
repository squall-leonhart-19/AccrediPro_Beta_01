            "question": "When utilizing advanced clinical assessment tools, a BMI-for-age Z-score of -3.2 in a 4-year-old child is classified by WHO standards as which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Moderate underweight",
                "Severe wasting/Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)",
                "Normal physiological variation",
                "Stunting with preserved weight-for-height"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to WHO and global pediatric standards, a Z-score below -3 standard deviations (SD) from the median indicates Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), requiring immediate clinical intervention."

            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Behavioral Remediation for ARFID, what is the primary goal of the 'Chain of Desensitization' in sensory-based feeding?",
            "options": [
                "To force the child to swallow a target food within the first session",
                "To utilize negative reinforcement until the child accepts a new texture",
                "To systematically reduce the 'threat' response by moving from visual tolerance to tactile, then gustatory interaction",
                "To replace all sensory-preferred foods with high-density nutritional supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners use systematic desensitization to lower the amygdala-driven fear response in ARFID, moving through a hierarchy of interaction (Look, Touch, Smell, Taste, Eat)."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner reviewing functional labs finds a Ferritin level of 15 ng/mL in a child with ADHD. Why is this biomarker significant even if Hemoglobin is within the normal range?",
            "options": [
                "Ferritin is a co-factor for dopamine synthesis and levels below 30 ng/mL are associated with increased symptom severity",
                "Ferritin levels below 20 ng/mL indicate immediate liver toxicity",
                "Low ferritin is the primary cause of childhood obesity",
                "Ferritin has no clinical significance unless Hemoglobin is below 11 g/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that iron stores (Ferritin) are crucial for tyrosine hydroxylase activity, the rate-limiting step in dopamine production; sub-optimal levels can exacerbate ADHD symptoms even without anemia."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to the principles of Epigenetics and Metabolic Programming, the 'mismatch hypothesis' suggests that a fetus exposed to undernutrition in utero is at higher risk for what in an environment of caloric abundance?",
            "options": [
                "Enhanced athletic performance due to metabolic efficiency",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Barker Hypothesis or 'Thrifty Phenotype' suggests that fetal adaptations to scarcity become maladaptive in nutrient-rich environments, leading to increased risk of metabolic disease."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In Family Systems Theory, 'Triangulation' during a pediatric nutrition intervention typically occurs when:",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner, the child, and the parent work in perfect harmony",
                "Three different doctors give the same nutritional advice",
                "A child's feeding behavior is used by parents to avoid addressing underlying marital or systemic conflict",
                "The child eats three meals a day with high consistency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triangulation is a dysfunctional family dynamic where a third party (the child's eating) is brought in to stabilize or deflect from the tension between two other people (usually the parents)."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "When managing 'Multi-Morbidity Integration' (e.g., a child with both Type 1 Diabetes and Celiac Disease), what is the practitioner's primary concern regarding the gluten-free diet?",
            "options": [
                "Gluten-free products are always lower in calories",
                "The higher Glycemic Index (GI) of many gluten-free substitutes can lead to unpredictable postprandial hyperglycemia",
                "Gluten-free diets cure Type 1 Diabetes automatically",
                "There are no concerns as long as the child avoids wheat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many gluten-free processed foods use high-GI starches (tapioca, rice flour) which can complicate blood glucose management in T1D, requiring advanced carbohydrate counting skills."

                "Only one practitioner is allowed to speak to the family",
                "The team does not include the parents in decision-making"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transdisciplinary teams involve 'role release,' where practitioners learn from each other to provide a cohesive strategy, reducing the burden of conflicting advice for the family."

            "id": "q24_8",

            "options": [
                "The child's serum albumin levels",
                "The practitioner's total revenue for the month",

                "The number of calories the child consumed in the clinic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PROMs focus on the client's (or parent's) perspective of health and quality of life. In pediatric nutrition, reducing parental stress is a key indicator of long-term success."

            "question": "Case Study: 7-year-old 'Maya' has severe sensory sensitivity and only eats 5 foods. Her parents are using 'pressure-to-eat' tactics. What is the Master Practitioner's first priority?",

                "Prescribe a high-dose multivitamin immediately",
                "Perform a 'food challenge' in the office to prove she can eat",

                "Refer her to surgery for a feeding tube"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex behavioral cases, the first step is to stop the cycle of 'pressure and resistance' which exacerbates sensory defensiveness and destroys the feeding relationship."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Practice Mastery requires understanding 'Scope of Practice.' When should a Pediatric Nutrition Coach refer a case to a Pediatric Gastroenterologist?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners must recognize clinical 'Red Flags'—symptoms of underlying organic pathology—that require medical diagnosis and management beyond nutritional coaching."
