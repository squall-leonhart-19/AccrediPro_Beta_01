                "The Evaluative Function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Normative function (also known as the administrative or managerial function) focuses on quality control, ethics, and adherence to professional standards and organizational policies."

            "question": "In Lesson 2's Peer Review Framework, what is the primary purpose of using a 'Blind Case Review' process?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the time spent on administrative paperwork",
                "To eliminate cognitive bias and the 'halo effect' during case evaluation",
                "To allow junior coaches to lead sessions without oversight",
                "To hide the identity of the client from the supervisor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blind reviews or structured rubrics are used in peer review to minimize bias and ensure that the intervention is evaluated based on clinical merit rather than the reputation of the coach."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "When mentoring a coach on 'Growth Assessment Precision' (Lesson 3), you notice a Z-score drop from +1 to -2 in weight-for-age over three months. This represents a change of how many standard deviations?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A move from +1 to -2 is a total change of 3 standard deviations, which is a significant clinical red flag requiring immediate investigation into nutritional intake or underlying pathology."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "In the 'R & O' framework (Lesson 4), 'Remediation' is triggered when a coach falls below the minimum competency threshold. What is the defining characteristic of 'Optimization'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While remediation fixes deficits, optimization focuses on taking a coach who is already meeting standards and helping them achieve mastery or specialized expertise."

            "question": "Lesson 5 introduces the 'W' Factor (Whole Family Wellness). If a coach reports that a child is not meeting goals because the parents have conflicting feeding styles, which supervisory strategy is most appropriate?",

            "question": "Using the SBI Feedback Model (Lesson 6), a supervisor says: 'During yesterday's consult (S), you interrupted the parent three times (B), which caused the parent to stop sharing their concerns (I).' What does 'SBI' stand for?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches cannot diagnose medical conditions (rickets) or prescribe therapeutic doses for medical treatment. This is a critical scope of practice boundary."

            "question": "A coach you are supervising consistently misses the 'plateau' in a child's height velocity. This is a technical error in which area of the 'G' (Growth) assessment?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Height velocity is a longitudinal measure. Missing a plateau indicates a failure to monitor the child's growth over time rather than just at a single point."
