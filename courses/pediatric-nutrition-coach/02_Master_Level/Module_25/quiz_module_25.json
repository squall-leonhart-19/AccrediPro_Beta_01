            "options": [
                "Administrative focuses on business metrics and billing, while Clinical focuses on practitioner skill and client outcomes.",
                "Administrative focuses on child growth charts, while Clinical focuses on family dynamics.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in pediatric nutrition.",
                "Clinical supervision is only required for licensed medical doctors, not nutrition coaches."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinical supervision focuses specifically on the development of the practitioner’s skills and the quality of client care, whereas administrative supervision deals with organizational requirements like scheduling and billing."

                "Over 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Lipman et al., 2022) have shown that manual plotting errors and misinterpretation of growth velocity occur in up to 30% of records, highlighting the need for 'G' (Growth) oversight in supervision."

            "question": "A supervisee presents a case where a toddler is meeting caloric needs but failing to meet micronutrient targets for Iron and Zinc. According to the 'R' & 'O' framework (L4), which strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Remediation (R), because the current plan is failing to prevent a nutrient deficiency.",
                "Optimization (O), because the child is growing well and only minor adjustments are needed.",
                "Termination, because the coach has reached their scope of practice limit.",
                "Wait-and-see, as micronutrient gaps usually resolve as the child ages."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Remediation (R) is triggered when the current intervention is not meeting essential physiological needs or safety standards. Optimization (O) is for fine-tuning a plan that is already fundamentally successful."

                "Supervisor lists weaknesses, supervisee lists strengths, then action plan.",
                "Supervisee states what they did well, supervisor states what was done well, supervisee states what could be improved, supervisor states what could be improved.",
                "Supervisor provides a 'sandwich' of praise, criticism, and more praise.",
                "Supervisee listens to a 360-degree review from the supervisor and family members simultaneously."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendleton's Rules prioritize the supervisee's self-reflection on strengths first, followed by the supervisor's observations on strengths, before moving into areas for improvement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation occurs when a third party (the coach) is pulled into a conflict between two others (parent and child), potentially undermining the therapeutic alliance and the child's autonomy."

                "To test if the supervisor can guess which coach handled the case.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Blind reviews help eliminate 'anchoring bias,' where the reviewer simply agrees with the initial assessment because it was already presented as fact."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing a medical condition (like Celiac Disease) is outside the scope of a nutrition coach and requires a medical professional. This is a critical risk management issue."
