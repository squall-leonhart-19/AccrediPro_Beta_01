            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrient-Density Optimization focuses on the 'nutritional bang for every bite,' prioritizing micronutrients essential for physiological development rather than just caloric volume."

                "Approximately 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 85% of brain development occurs within the first three years of life, making the 'First 1,000 Days' a critical window for neuro-nutritional intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bio-individuality recognizes unique sensory profiles. Tactile defensiveness is a sensory issue, not a behavioral choice, and requires gradual texture-desensitization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crowding out is a low-stress strategy that focuses on addition rather than restriction, respecting the child's autonomy and reducing the 'forbidden fruit' effect."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modeling is the primary driver of the family ecosystem. Children are more likely to consume foods they see their parents eating and enjoying without external pressure."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infants are born with iron stores that typically last 4-6 months. After this, breast milk (which is low in iron) must be supplemented with iron-rich complementary foods."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcium is essential for rapid skeletal growth (PHV), and Iron is critical for increased blood volume and to replace losses during menstruation (menarche)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Significant 'falling off' the growth curve (crossing percentiles) is a clinical indicator of potential 'failure to thrive' or underlying pathology and requires medical referral."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While some families report success, large-scale meta-analyses show inconsistent results, suggesting it should be applied based on bio-individuality and confirmed sensitivities rather than as a blanket protocol."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The sDOR (Parent provides, Child decides) is the gold standard for ending food policing and fostering internal hunger/satiety cues."
