            "question": "In the hierarchy of evidence for pediatric nutrition, which of the following is considered the most reliable for making clinical recommendations?",
            "options": [
                "Expert opinion and consensus reports",
                "Case-control studies and retrospective reviews",

                "Single-blinded randomized controlled trials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses sit at the top of the evidence hierarchy as they synthesize data from multiple high-quality studies to provide a more robust conclusion."

            "question": "A coach is reviewing a study on toddler zinc supplementation. The study reports a p-value of 0.04. What does this statistically represent?",
            "options": [
                "There is a 4% chance the results were due to random chance",
                "The results are clinically significant for 96% of the population",
                "The study is 4% more accurate than previous research",
                "The intervention failed to meet the threshold for significance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.04 is below the standard 0.05 threshold, indicating that there is a 4% probability that the observed results occurred by chance, making the finding statistically significant."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projectile vomiting and failure to thrive (weight stagnation or loss) are clinical indicators of potential underlying pathology that exceed the coach's scope of practice."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have consistently shown that sugar does not have a significant effect on the behavior or cognitive performance of children; the perceived 'sugar high' is often attributed to parental expectation or the environment (e.g., parties)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethically, a coach must not recommend restrictive diets for suspected medical conditions without a formal diagnosis, as eliminating gluten before testing can lead to false-negative results for Celiac disease."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Teach-Back method is an evidence-based communication tool used to confirm that the parent has understood the information provided, which improves adherence and safety."

            "question": "In Lesson 1's case study of 'Supplement X,' the study had a small sample size (n=15) and no control group. Why is this considered 'low-quality' evidence?",
            "options": [
                "Because 15 is a lucky number in research",
                "Because it lacks a comparison group to account for the placebo effect or natural growth",
                "Because the researchers did not use a digital tracking app",
                "Because supplements are never supported by science"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small sample sizes and the lack of a control group increase the risk of bias and make it impossible to determine if the outcome was caused by the supplement or other external factors."
