            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "The human brain is approximately 60% lipid by dry weight. Which specific long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) accounts for over 90% of the omega-3 fatty acids found in the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)",
                "Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)",
                "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)",
                "Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHA is the primary structural fatty acid in the gray matter of the brain and the retina, representing the vast majority of the brain's omega-3 content and being critical for synaptic plasticity."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Neuro-Nutritional Axis,' iron deficiency during the first 1,000 days of life is particularly damaging because it irreversibly impairs which neurological process?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Iron is a mandatory co-factor for enzymes involved in myelin synthesis; deficiency during critical windows can lead to permanent deficits in processing speed and executive function due to poor myelination."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Regarding the Pediatric Gut-Brain Axis, what percentage of the body's total serotonin is estimated to be produced by enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority (over 90%) of the body's serotonin is synthesized in the gut, where it regulates motility and communicates with the CNS via the vagus nerve."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on nutritional interventions for ADHD found that while elimination diets can be effective for a subset of 'sensitive' children, the most consistent (though modest) effect sizes (r ≈ 0.18-0.30) were observed with which intervention?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 supplementation, particularly those with higher EPA-to-DHA ratios, has shown consistent, statistically significant benefits in reducing ADHD symptoms across multiple meta-analyses."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) frequently exhibit 'beige diets' due to sensory processing sensitivities. Which clinical approach is recommended to expand their nutrient intake without causing further food aversion?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Hide and Seek' method (pureeing vegetables into favorite foods)",
                "Sensory bridging (introducing foods with similar textures or colors)",
                "Restricted feeding windows to increase hunger cues",
                "Force-feeding protocols to ensure caloric density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory bridging leverages the child's existing preferences by introducing new foods that share a single sensory characteristic (like color or crunch) with a 'safe' food, reducing the neophobic response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which micronutrient acts as a critical co-factor for the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, which is necessary for the synthesis of serotonin and subsequently melatonin for sleep regulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron (along with Vitamin B6 and Magnesium) is a required co-factor for the rate-limiting enzymes that convert tryptophan into serotonin and melatonin, linking iron status directly to sleep quality."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Environmental Toxins, what is the established 'safe' blood lead level (BLL) in children as defined by the CDC, below which no neurodevelopmental damage occurs?",

                "2 μg/dL",
                "There is no known safe blood lead level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Current scientific consensus and the CDC state that there is no safe level of lead exposure for children; even very low levels are associated with permanent IQ loss and behavioral issues."

                "Zinc causes immediate permanent staining of tooth enamel",
                "Zinc is a fat-soluble mineral that builds up in adipose tissue",
                "Zinc has no known Upper Limit (UL) for children"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zinc and copper use the same transport proteins in the intestines; chronic high-dose zinc supplementation can inhibit copper absorption, leading to copper deficiency and potential neurological or hematological issues."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "In the 'Oxford-Durham Study,' what was the primary outcome for children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) treated with a specific ratio of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Oxford-Durham trial was a landmark study showing that fatty acid supplementation significantly improved academic performance (reading/spelling) and reduced behavioral problems in children with coordination difficulties."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary metabolic characteristic often found in children with ASD that justifies the use of mitochondrial support nutrients like CoQ10 and L-Carnitine?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive production of Vitamin C",
                "Elevated levels of oxidative stress and impaired methylation",
                "Superior glutathione production",
                "Hypersensitivity to dietary fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that many children with ASD have biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction, including high oxidative stress and reduced methylation capacity, making nutrients like CoQ10 and L-carnitine potentially beneficial."
