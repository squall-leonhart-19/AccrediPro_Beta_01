            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the human brain's dry weight is comprised of lipids, and which fatty acid is most critical for retinal and cortical development during the first 1,000 days?",
            "options": [
                "40% lipid; Arachidonic Acid (ARA)",
                "60% lipid; Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)",
                "50% lipid; Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA)",
                "75% lipid; Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The human brain is approximately 60% lipid by dry weight. DHA is the primary structural omega-3 fatty acid in the gray matter of the brain and the retina, making it essential for cognitive and visual development."

            "question": "In a 2022 clinical review of pediatric executive function, which ferritin threshold was identified as a critical marker for preventing cognitive 'fog' and attention deficits in school-aged children?",
            "options": [
                "Ferritin < 12 ng/mL",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges vary, research indicates that ferritin levels below 30 ng/mL are often associated with decreased executive function and increased ADHD-like symptoms, even in the absence of clinical anemia."

                "Ammonia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, are produced by the fermentation of fiber by gut microbiota. They have neuroprotective properties and can influence the integrity of the blood-brain barrier."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-quality meta-analyses show that Omega-3 supplementation, particularly those with higher ratios of EPA to DHA, shows a modest but significant effect size in reducing ADHD symptoms compared to placebo."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "For children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which metabolic pathway is frequently impaired, often requiring higher clinical focus on B12, Folate, and Magnesium?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylation impairments are common in ASD populations, affecting DNA expression and neurotransmitter synthesis. Supporting this cycle with bioactive folate, B12, and magnesium is a cornerstone of neuro-nutritional support."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which amino acid serves as the direct nutritional precursor to Serotonin and Melatonin, and what dietary factor is required to facilitate its transport across the blood-brain barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Tyrosine; requires high protein intake",
                "Tryptophan; requires a carbohydrate-induced insulin response",
                "L-Theanine; requires caffeine",
                "Glutamine; requires dietary fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan is the precursor to serotonin and melatonin. Because it competes with Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs) for transport, a small amount of carbohydrate helps trigger insulin, which clears other LNAAs and allows Tryptophan to cross the BBB."
