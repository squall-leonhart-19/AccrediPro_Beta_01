            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 15' involves consuming 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates (like 4oz of juice or glucose tabs) and rechecking blood glucose in 15 minutes to ensure it has risen above 70 mg/dL."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 4:1 ratio is the gold standard for the classic therapeutic ketogenic diet, where 90% of calories come from fat to maintain consistent ketosis for seizure control."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "An anti-inflammatory dietary approach for pediatric asthma focuses on increasing the intake of Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA). What is the primary mechanism by which these fats assist in asthma management?",
            "options": [
                "They increase mucus production in the bronchioles",
                "They compete with arachidonic acid to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes",
                "They act as a direct bronchodilator similar to rescue inhalers",
                "They prevent the absorption of all dietary allergens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids inhibit the synthesis of pro-inflammatory 4-series leukotrienes, which are potent mediators of airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction in asthma."
