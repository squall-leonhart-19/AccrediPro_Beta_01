            "question": "According to Ellyn Satter's Division of Responsibility (sDOR), which of the following is the exclusive responsibility of the parent/caregiver?",
            "options": [
                "Determining how much of a specific food the child must consume",
                "Deciding whether the child eats at all during a scheduled meal",
                "Choosing the location and timing of the meal",
                "Ensuring the child tries at least one 'no-thank-you' bite"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the sDOR model, the parent is responsible for the 'What, When, and Where' of feeding, while the child is responsible for 'How Much' and 'Whether' they eat from what is provided."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A 2011 meta-analysis by Hammons and Fiese (n=182,836) found that children who shared at least three family meals per week were how much more likely to be in a normal weight range?",
            "options": [
                "12% more likely",
                "24% more likely",
                "35% more likely",
                "50% more likely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found that children sharing at least 3 family meals per week were 12% more likely to be in a normal weight range and 24% more likely to eat healthier foods."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The 'Mirror Effect' in parental modeling suggests that a child's vegetable consumption is most strongly correlated with:",
            "options": [
                "The parent's verbal encouragement to eat vegetables",
                "The parent's own visible enjoyment and intake of vegetables",
                "The availability of vegetables in the pantry",
                "The use of rewards for eating green vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that observational learning is more powerful than verbal pressure; children are significantly more likely to consume foods they see their parents eating with genuine enjoyment."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When implementing 'Food Chaining' for a sensory-sensitive child who only eats McDonald's chicken nuggets, what would be the most appropriate first step?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately switch to organic, home-cooked chicken breast",
                "Offer a different brand of frozen nugget with a similar shape and texture",
                "Remove all nuggets from the house to force dietary diversity",
                "Serve the McDonald's nugget with a side of broccoli"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food chaining relies on 'micro-shifts.' Moving to a similar brand of nugget maintains the sensory profile (shape/texture) while introducing a slight variation, reducing the risk of meal rejection."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Forbidden Fruit' effect (Fisher & Birch, 1999), what is the typical result of strictly restricting a specific highly palatable food?",
            "options": [
                "The child loses interest in the food over time",
                "The child develops a higher self-regulatory capacity",
                "The child shows increased preoccupation and overconsumption when the food becomes available",
                "The child's caloric intake naturally decreases to compensate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strict restriction often backfires, leading to increased behavioral focus on the restricted food and a tendency to overeat it in 'disinhibited' environments where the parent is not present."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In the context of the home food environment, 'Nudge Theory' suggests that placing a fruit bowl on the counter instead of in a crisper drawer can increase fruit consumption by up to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Data from the Cornell Food and Brand Lab shows that visibility and accessibility (the 'nudge') can more than double the consumption of healthy items compared to when they are hidden."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which meal planning strategy is most effective for reducing 'decision fatigue' in busy households?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Theme Night' approach (e.g., Taco Tuesday, Pasta Thursday)",
                "Cooking a completely new recipe every night of the week",
                "Relying on daily grocery shopping trips",
                "Allowing each family member to choose a different meal simultaneously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Theme nights provide a structural framework that narrows the decision-making field, reducing cognitive load while still allowing for nutritional variety within that theme."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A child refuses to eat the salmon served at dinner. Using the sDOR framework, how should the parent respond?",
            "options": [
                "Make the child a PB&J sandwich so they don't go to bed hungry",
                "Require the child to sit at the table until the salmon is finished",
                "Acknowledge the refusal and remind the child that the kitchen will be closed until breakfast",
                "Offer a dessert as a reward if they eat half the salmon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The parent provides the meal; the child decides whether to eat. If the child chooses not to eat, they must wait until the next scheduled meal or snack, which maintains the structure of the 'When' and 'Where'."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "What is the recommended number of 'neutral exposures' often required before a child may accept a new or previously disliked food?",
            "options": [
                "1-2 exposures",
                "3-5 exposures",
                "10-15 exposures",
                "Over 50 exposures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research in pediatric nutrition consistently shows that it takes an average of 10 to 15 repeated, non-pressured exposures for a child's palate to adapt and accept a new flavor or texture."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Sustainable habit formation relies on 'Implementation Intentions.' Which of the following is an example of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "'I want my family to eat more vegetables.'",
                "'We will try harder to have family dinners.'",
                "'If it is 6:00 PM on a weekday, then I will place a pre-cut vegetable tray on the table.'",
                "'We are going to stop eating sugar starting tomorrow.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions use 'If-Then' planning to link a specific situational cue (6:00 PM) with a specific behavior (vegetable tray), which significantly increases the likelihood of habit adherence."
