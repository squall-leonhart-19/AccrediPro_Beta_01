            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the sDOR model, the parent is responsible for the 'What, When, and Where,' while the child is responsible for 'How much and Whether' to eat."

            "question": "A 2012 report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) found that adolescents who eat dinner with their families 5-7 times per week are approximately how many times less likely to use tobacco?",

                "10 times less likely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CASA study demonstrated that frequent family meals (5-7 times per week) resulted in teens being 4x less likely to use tobacco, 2x less likely to use alcohol, and 2.5x less likely to use marijuana."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, such as those by Fisher et al. (2002), consistently show a strong positive correlation (r=0.4 to 0.5) between parental intake and child intake, highlighting the power of modeling."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Using dessert as a reward for eating vegetables (e.g., 'Eat your broccoli and you can have cake') has been shown by Birch et al. to have what effect?",

                "It increases the child's long-term preference for broccoli",
                "It has no effect on food preferences",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Forbidden Fruit' and reward research shows that using a food as a bribe decreases the child's preference for the 'work' food (broccoli) and increases the value of the 'reward' food (cake)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice indicates that it takes an average of 10-15 neutral exposures for a child to move from 'fear' of a food to 'acceptance' or 'liking.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thematic Meal Mapping reduces the cognitive load by providing a structured framework, making the 'What's for dinner?' question easier to answer and execute."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions are 'If-Then' plans (e.g., 'If it is 5:00 PM, then I will chop the vegetables') that significantly increase the likelihood of habit adherence by automating the response to a cue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fisher & Birch (1999) demonstrated that children who are highly restricted from 'palatable' foods are more likely to overeat those foods and ignore internal satiety cues when they gain access to them."
