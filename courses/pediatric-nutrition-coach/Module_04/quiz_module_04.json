            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "When assessing for hidden nutrient deficiencies (Lesson 1), which biomarker is considered the most sensitive early indicator of iron depletion in children before clinical anemia is reflected in Hemoglobin levels?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Ferritin",
                "Hematocrit",
                "Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)",
                "Transferrin Saturation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Serum Ferritin reflects stored iron. In pediatric populations, ferritin levels often drop significantly (subclinical deficiency) while hemoglobin remains within 'normal' limits, leading to symptoms like fatigue and cognitive irritability."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the protein 'Zonulin' is highlighted as a key physiological modulator. What is its primary role in the context of pediatric gut health?",
            "options": [
                "Breaking down complex carbohydrates in the small intestine",
                "Regulating the opening of tight junctions in the intestinal lining",
                "Acting as a primary fuel source for Bifidobacteria",
                "Neutralizing gastric acid in the stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut'), allowing undigested food particles and endotoxins into the bloodstream."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Total Toxic Burden' concept in Lesson 3, why are children more susceptible to environmental toxins like phthalates and BPA compared to adults?",
            "options": [
                "Children have higher gastric pH which absorbs toxins faster",
                "Children have a higher surface-area-to-mass ratio and immature detoxification pathways",
                "Adults have more adipose tissue to sequester toxins safely",
                "Children lack a blood-brain barrier until age 12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children breathe more air, drink more water, and eat more food per pound of body weight than adults. Combined with immature Phase II liver detoxification, this increases their vulnerability to endocrine disruptors."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the link between nutrition and behavior. A 2012 meta-analysis regarding ADHD and diet suggested that what percentage of children with ADHD may react negatively to Artificial Food Colorings (AFCs)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 8%",
                "Approximately 33%",
                "Approximately 75%",
                "Less than 2%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly one-third (33%) of children with ADHD show significant behavioral improvement when artificial dyes are removed, suggesting a sensitivity-based root cause for a subset of the population."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Regarding pediatric sleep hygiene (Lesson 5), research shows that exposure to blue light (450-480nm) suppresses melatonin in children ____ as much as it does in adults.",
            "options": [
                "Half",
                "The same amount",
                "Twice",
                "Five times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children's larger pupils and clearer lenses allow more light to reach the retina. Studies show evening light exposure suppresses melatonin twice as much in children, significantly disrupting their circadian rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is discussed. What does an elevated hs-CRP (e.g., 1.5 mg/L) in a child without an active infection typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "A robust and healthy immune system",
                "An acute bacterial infection requiring antibiotics",
                "Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation",
                "A genetic predisposition to high bone density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While standard CRP detects acute infection (levels >10 mg/L), hs-CRP detects 'smoldering' or chronic low-grade inflammation, often linked to diet, gut dysbiosis, or environmental stressors."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When reviewing laboratory testing for pediatric populations (Lesson 7), why is it a mistake to use 'Standard Reference Ranges' provided by most commercial labs?",
            "options": [
                "Commercial labs only test adult blood samples",
                "Standard ranges are often based on 'average' populations, not 'optimal' health",
                "Standard ranges are regulated by insurance companies, not scientists",
                "Pediatric blood chemistry is identical to adults after age 2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard reference ranges are statistical averages of the people who visit that lab (who are often sick). A Pediatric Nutrition Coach looks for 'functional' or 'optimal' ranges that support growth and development."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the 'Root-Cause Analysis Framework' (Lesson 8), which of the following is considered a 'Mediator' rather than a 'Trigger'?",
            "options": [
                "A single course of broad-spectrum antibiotics",
                "A severe bout of food poisoning",
                "Ongoing oxidative stress and nutrient depletion",
                "A sudden move to a new house with mold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Triggers are discrete events that initiate symptoms (like antibiotics or mold). Mediators are ongoing processes (like oxidative stress or chronic inflammation) that keep the symptoms going."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 7-year-old client presents with chronic eczema, dark circles under the eyes ('allergic shiners'), and frequent bloating. Using the NURTURE framework, what is the most likely primary system to investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "Cardiovascular efficiency",
                "Gastrointestinal integrity and microbiome balance",
                "Muscle skeletal alignment",
                "Exogenous hormone exposure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of skin issues (eczema), physical signs of allergy (shiners), and digestive distress (bloating) strongly points to gut-mediated immune activation and dysbiosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, which 'short-chain fatty acid' (SCFA) is the primary energy source for colonocytes and is essential for maintaining the gut barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Acetate",
                "Propionate",
                "Butyrate",
                "Lactate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel for the cells lining the colon. Low butyrate levels are frequently found in children with low fiber intake and are linked to increased gut permeability."
