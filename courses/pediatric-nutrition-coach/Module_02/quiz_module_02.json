            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Nutrient Density Score' is defined by the ratio of essential nutrients to which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Total weight of the food in grams",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrient density is calculated by the ratio of essential micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients) to the total energy (calories) provided by the food. High nutrient density means high micronutrient content per calorie."

            "question": "A case study in Lesson 3 describes 'Milk Anemia' in a 2-year-old. This condition most frequently occurs when excessive cow's milk consumption (over 24oz/day) leads to a deficiency in which mineral?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Excessive cow's milk can cause iron deficiency (Milk Anemia) because milk is low in iron, and the high calcium/casein content inhibits the absorption of the little iron present in other foods."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phytates (phytic acid) are antioxidant compounds that bind to minerals like zinc, calcium, and iron in the digestive tract, forming insoluble complexes that the body cannot absorb."
