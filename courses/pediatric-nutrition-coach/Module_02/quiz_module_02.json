            "question": "According to the 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 1, what percentage of children globally are estimated to suffer from at least one micronutrient deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Over 50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Global data indicates that over 50% of children worldwide suffer from at least one micronutrient deficiency, often referred to as 'hidden hunger.'"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in orange slices significantly enhances the absorption of non-heme iron found in plant sources like lentils by reducing it to a more soluble form."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Tactile hypersensitivity involves an over-responsiveness to certain textures, where 'wet' or 'slimy' textures trigger a gag reflex or avoidance response."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the G.R.O.W. Food Exposure Protocol, what is the primary objective of the 'Reveal' phase?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Reveal' phase focuses on neutral exposure, bringing the food into the child's visual field without any external pressure to consume it."

                "Vitamin D should never be taken with fats",
                "It causes immediate iron depletion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must stay within the Upper Tolerable Limits; for children aged 4-8, the UL is established at 3,000 IU per day to prevent toxicity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Remediation requires monitoring. Re-testing at the 3-month mark allows the practitioner to see if the ferritin stores are replenishing and determine if supplementation should continue."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Research indicates that for a child with severe food neophobia, how many 'neutral' exposures are typically required before a new food is accepted into their regular rotation?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that 10 to 15 repeated, pressure-free exposures are necessary for most children to develop a preference for a new food."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gagging at the mere sight or smell of food (distal sensing) indicates a severe sensory processing challenge that goes beyond typical picky eating and requires specialized therapy."
