            "question": "A 2-year-old client consumes 30 ounces of whole cow's milk daily and refuses most meats and leafy greens. Based on Lesson 2, what is the most likely mechanism for their iron deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium and casein in the milk are inhibiting non-heme iron absorption and displacing iron-rich foods.",
                "The child has an underlying genetic inability to process heme iron.",
                "Cow's milk contains high levels of phytates that bind to iron in the gut.",
                "The child is experiencing physiological blood loss due to lactose intolerance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excessive milk intake (>24oz/day) causes 'milk anemia' by displacing iron-dense foods and because calcium and casein competitively inhibit iron absorption."

                "1,000 IU per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AAP and clinical guidelines recommend 400 IU of Vitamin D daily for all breastfed infants starting shortly after birth because breast milk typically contains low levels (approx. 25-78 IU/L)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neophobia is an evolutionary survival mechanism that peaks between ages 2 and 6, often coinciding with increased mobility and the biological drive to avoid potentially toxic unknown substances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gradual Exposure is the first step of the G.R.O.W. protocol, focusing on desensitization through sight, touch, and smell before any ingestion is expected."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A child gags only when presented with 'mushy' textures like mashed potatoes or yogurt, but easily consumes crunchy crackers and raw carrots. This is most indicative of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Texture-specific gagging is a hallmark of sensory processing differences, where the brain over-responds to specific tactile inputs (like 'slimy' or 'mushy' textures)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C can increase non-heme iron absorption by 2-3 times by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous form and preventing the formation of insoluble iron complexes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The UL is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects; exceeding this increases the risk of toxicity."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A practitioner is using the 'Objective Observation' step of the G.R.O.W. protocol. Which of the following is an example of an 'objective' observation a child might make?",
            "options": [
                "'This broccoli is gross.'",
                "'I hate the way this looks.'",

                "'I am not going to eat that.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective observation removes emotional judgment (like 'gross' or 'hate') and focuses on the physical properties of the food (texture, temperature, color), which reduces the child's anxiety."
