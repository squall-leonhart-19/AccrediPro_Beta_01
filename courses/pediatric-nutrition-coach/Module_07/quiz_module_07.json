            "question": "Research regarding ADHD and micronutrient status suggests that which specific laboratory marker should be maintained above 30 ng/mL to support optimal dopamine synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Magnesium",
                "Serum Ferritin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serum ferritin is a co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. Levels below 30 ng/mL are frequently associated with increased ADHD symptom severity."

            "question": "Which of the following distinguishes an IgE-mediated food allergy from a non-IgE mediated food intolerance?",
            "options": [
                "IgE-mediated reactions are dose-dependent and take days to manifest.",
                "IgE-mediated reactions involve the immune system and typically occur within minutes to two hours.",
                "Food intolerances always involve the respiratory system.",
                "Non-IgE mediated reactions are life-threatening and require an EpiPen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IgE-mediated allergies involve an immediate immune response (Type I hypersensitivity) that can lead to anaphylaxis, whereas intolerances are generally digestive-based and dose-dependent."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The mode of delivery is a primary determinant of early microbial colonization, with vaginal delivery providing exposure to maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota (Lactobacillus), while C-sections often lead to colonization by skin-associated bacteria."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Current pediatric sports nutrition guidelines recommend 30-60g of rapidly oxidizing carbohydrates per hour for activities exceeding 90 minutes to maintain blood glucose and performance."

                "Avoid all fruits and vegetables unless they are organic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rice tends to absorb more arsenic from the environment than other grains. Diversifying grains (oats, barley) is the primary strategy recommended by the FDA to reduce infant exposure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight inclusivity focuses on 'growth stability.' A child consistently at the 95th percentile may be perfectly healthy, as long as they are following their own curve and not showing rapid, unexplained shifts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
