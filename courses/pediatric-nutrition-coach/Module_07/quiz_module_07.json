            "question": "Research indicates that children with ADHD often exhibit lower serum levels of specific micronutrients. Which combination has been most strongly correlated with symptom severity in meta-analyses?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C and Calcium",
                "Zinc, Iron, and Omega-3 Fatty Acids",
                "Vitamin B12 and Potassium",
                "Selenium and Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have consistently shown that children with ADHD often have lower levels of Zinc, Iron (ferritin), and Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and supplementation in deficient individuals can improve cognitive focus."

            "question": "In the context of pediatric food allergies, what is the primary physiological difference between an IgE-mediated reaction and a non-IgE-mediated reaction (such as FPIES)?",
            "options": [
                "IgE-mediated reactions are always delayed by 48 hours.",
                "Non-IgE-mediated reactions involve the immediate release of histamine from mast cells.",
                "IgE-mediated reactions involve immediate hypersensitivity and risk of anaphylaxis, while non-IgE reactions are typically cell-mediated and delayed.",
                "There is no physiological difference; the terms are used interchangeably."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IgE-mediated reactions occur rapidly (minutes to 2 hours) due to histamine release and carry an anaphylaxis risk. Non-IgE reactions, like Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES), involve the T-cells of the immune system and usually manifest 2-6 hours after ingestion."

            "question": "A 2022 study on the gut-brain axis found that Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) produced by the microbiome play what role in pediatric neurodevelopment?",
            "options": [
                "They act as direct precursors to muscle tissue growth.",
                "They modulate the blood-brain barrier integrity and microglia activation.",
                "They prevent the absorption of all dietary cholesterol.",
                "They are the primary source of glucose for the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs (like butyrate, propionate, and acetate) are metabolites produced by gut bacteria that influence the central nervous system by maintaining the blood-brain barrier and regulating neuroinflammation via microglia."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "To prevent dehydration and heat illness, what is the recommended fluid intake volume for a 10-year-old child during vigorous physical activity?",
            "options": [
                "1-2 ounces every 60 minutes",
                "4-8 ounces every 15-20 minutes",
                "24 ounces once at the end of the game",
                "Only drink when the child reports feeling thirsty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children have a higher surface-area-to-body-mass ratio than adults and sweat less efficiently. The clinical recommendation is 4-8 ounces (100-250ml) every 15-20 minutes during activity to maintain euhydration."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The FDA and AAP have issued specific warnings regarding inorganic arsenic levels in which common pediatric food staple?",
            "options": [
                "Whole wheat bread",
                "Organic spinach",
                "Rice-based cereals and crackers",
                "Pasteurized cow's milk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rice plants absorb more arsenic from the soil and water than other grains. Because infants consume a high volume of food relative to their body weight, the FDA regulates inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal to reduce neurodevelopmental risks."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "According to Ellyn Satter’s Division of Responsibility (sDOR), which is a cornerstone of weight-inclusive pediatric nutrition, what is the parent's primary role?",
            "options": [
                "Determining how much the child must eat to stay on their growth curve.",
                "Choosing which foods are served, when they are served, and where they are served.",
                "Restricting 'junk' foods to prevent weight gain.",
                "Counting the child's caloric intake to ensure it matches the RDA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the sDOR model, the parent is responsible for the 'What, When, and Where' of feeding, while the child is responsible for the 'How Much' and 'Whether' they eat, which supports the development of internal satiety cues."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "How does Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) differ from typical 'picky eating' in childhood?",
            "options": [
                "ARFID is only found in children over the age of 12.",
                "ARFID involves significant nutritional deficiencies, dependence on enteral feeding/supplements, or psychosocial interference.",
                "Picky eating is a clinical diagnosis, while ARFID is a phase.",
                "ARFID is driven solely by a desire for thinness and body dissatisfaction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike typical picky eating, ARFID is a clinical eating disorder characterized by extreme sensory sensitivity or fear of aversive consequences (like choking) that results in significant weight loss or nutritional deficiency, without body image disturbance."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) require a specialized nutritional approach due to malabsorption. What is the typical energy requirement for a child with CF compared to a healthy peer?",
            "options": [
                "50-75% of the standard RDA",
                "Exactly 100% of the standard RDA",
                "110-200% of the standard RDA",
                "300-400% of the standard RDA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to pancreatic insufficiency and the high metabolic cost of chronic infection/labored breathing, children with CF typically require 110% to 200% of the calories recommended for their age and sex, with a high emphasis on fat intake."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "When working with a neurodivergent client (ASD) who exhibits 'beige food' preference, what is the most effective evidence-based strategy for expanding the diet?",
            "options": [
                "Hiding pureed vegetables in preferred foods without the child knowing.",
                "Food chaining, which involves introducing new foods that share similar sensory characteristics to accepted foods.",
                "Withholding the preferred food until the new food is eaten (the 'Premack Principle').",
                "Eliminating all gluten and casein immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food chaining builds on the child's sensory preferences (e.g., moving from a McDonald's fry to a home-cooked fry, then to a roasted potato wedge) to gradually expand the palate without causing sensory overwhelm."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis (n=12,000) regarding weight-neutral care in pediatrics found that focusing on 'healthy habits' rather than 'weight status' resulted in:",
            "options": [
                "Significant weight gain and increased health risks.",
                "Improved self-esteem and metabolic health markers without increasing eating disorder risk.",
                "No change in health markers whatsoever.",
                "A decrease in physical activity levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight-inclusive or weight-neutral care focuses on behaviors (sleep, movement, variety) rather than the scale, which has been shown to improve psychological outcomes and metabolic health while reducing the risk of disordered eating."
