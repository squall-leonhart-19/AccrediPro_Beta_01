            "question": "Approximately what percentage of a child's immune system is located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "30-40%",
                "50-60%",
                "70-80%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that approximately 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut, making the microbiome and intestinal barrier the primary defense against pediatric pathogens."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Glucose-Ascorbate Competition' theory discussed in Lesson 5, why does high sugar intake impair immune function?",
            "options": [
                "Glucose and Vitamin C share the same cellular transport (GLUT receptors), and high glucose prevents Vitamin C from entering white blood cells.",
                "Sugar causes immediate destruction of existing Vitamin C molecules in the bloodstream.",
                "Sugar increases the pH of the blood, making Vitamin C inactive.",
                "Glucose binds to Vitamin C to create a toxic byproduct that kills T-cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C and glucose have similar chemical structures and compete for the same GLUT receptors. High blood sugar levels effectively 'lock out' Vitamin C from entering leukocytes, reducing their phagocytic capacity."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course found that children with serum Vitamin D levels below what threshold had a significantly higher risk of recurrent respiratory infections?",

                "10 ng/mL",
                "20 ng/mL",
                "30 ng/mL",
                "50 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 20 ng/mL is often cited as the floor for bone health, optimal immune resilience in children is generally associated with serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which specific functional food component is known for its ability to prime the innate immune system by binding to Dectin-1 receptors on macrophages?",
            "options": [
                "Anthocyanins in blueberries",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucans are unique polysaccharides that act as biological response modifiers, training the innate immune system to respond more efficiently to threats without causing over-inflammation."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "When a child is recovering from a viral illness (Lesson 7), which amino acid becomes 'conditionally essential' to support the repair of the intestinal lining and fuel rapidly dividing immune cells?",
            "options": [
                "L-Arginine",
                "L-Glutamine",

                "L-Tryptophan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutamine is the primary fuel source for enterocytes and lymphocytes. During illness or physical stress, the body's demand for glutamine often exceeds its ability to produce it, making it essential for recovery."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Phagocytic Index' and how is it affected by the consumption of 100g of refined sugar?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the speed of T-cell replication; it increases by 20%.",
                "It measures the ability of white blood cells to engulf bacteria; it decreases by approximately 50% for up to 5 hours.",
                "It measures the thickness of the gut mucosa; it doubles in response to sugar.",
                "It measures the amount of iron in the blood; it drops to near zero."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Classic studies (Sanchez et al.) demonstrated that a large dose of sugar significantly reduces the phagocytic index—the ability of neutrophils to engulf pathogens—for several hours after ingestion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-glycemic breakfasts cause a rapid spike in insulin followed by a blood sugar crash. The body views this low blood sugar as a crisis, releasing stress hormones (cortisol/adrenaline) which cause the behavioral symptoms Maya is experiencing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zinc is unique in its dual role: it is essential for maintaining the intestinal barrier (preventing 'leaky gut') and it has direct antiviral properties by interfering with viral replication cycles."

            "options": [
                "Different colors represent different phytonutrients that work synergistically to protect various cellular compartments.",
                "Bright colors attract children's attention, ensuring they eat more calories.",
                "The dyes in natural foods act as natural antibiotics.",
                "Colorful foods contain more water, preventing seasonal dehydration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phytonutrients like flavonoids, carotenoids, and proanthocyanidins provide diverse antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that support the immune system in ways that single-nutrient supplements cannot replicate."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Protein + Fat + Fiber' formula is the gold standard for slowing gastric emptying and ensuring a gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream, preventing the spikes and crashes that tax the immune system."
