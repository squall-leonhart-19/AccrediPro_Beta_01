            "question": "According to the 2022 pediatric metabolic guidelines discussed in Lesson 1, what HOMA-IR threshold is most commonly utilized in clinical research to identify insulin resistance in prepubertal children?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 or greater",
                "2.6 or greater",

                "4.0 or greater"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While adult thresholds are lower, research consistently identifies a HOMA-IR of 2.6 or greater as a significant marker for insulin resistance in prepubertal children, reflecting the unique metabolic demands of growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "35%",
                "50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 3:1 to 4:1 carbohydrate-to-protein ratio is the gold standard for post-exercise recovery, as the carbohydrates stimulate insulin to drive amino acids into the muscle tissue."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5's exploration of the Gut-Brain Axis, which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is highlighted for its specific role in upregulating the expression of 'tight junction' proteins like occludin to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all SCFAs are beneficial, Butyrate is particularly critical for intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity by fueling colonocytes and signaling through G-protein coupled receptors."

            "options": [
                "They act as 'androgen antagonists,' blocking the action of testosterone",
                "They permanently destroy the thyroid gland's ability to uptake iodine",
                "They increase the rate of gastric emptying, leading to mineral malabsorption",
                "They inhibit the production of insulin in the pancreas"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are primarily known as anti-androgens, meaning they interfere with male reproductive development and can disrupt the timing of puberty in both sexes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Over 40% of total adult bone mass is built during the short window of adolescence, making this a 'critical period' for osteoporosis prevention later in life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Affirmations (the 'A' in OARS) focus on recognizing the client's strengths and efforts rather than just acknowledging their feelings (Reflection) or asking questions."

            "options": [
                "To prevent the adolescent from losing too much body fat",
                "To shunt glucose toward growing tissues and support the action of Growth Hormone (GH)",
                "Because adolescents typically stop exercising during these stages",
                "Due to the temporary loss of gut microbiome diversity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 25-30% reduction in insulin sensitivity is a normal physiological adaptation during puberty to ensure adequate glucose availability for rapid somatic growth and development."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Food chaining is a successful, low-stress strategy that builds on existing sensory preferences to expand a child's palate incrementally."
