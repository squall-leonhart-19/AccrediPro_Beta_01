            "question": "According to the 'Barker Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 1, how does prenatal nutrition impact long-term health outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Nutritional status during pregnancy only affects the birth weight of the infant.",
                "Intrauterine environments program the fetus's metabolism, increasing the risk of chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes in adulthood.",
                "Prenatal nutrition has no impact on the child's health after the age of two.",
                "The mother's diet only affects the child's health if she has a pre-existing medical condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Barker Hypothesis (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease) suggests that under-nutrition or over-nutrition in utero can lead to permanent physiological changes, predisposing the individual to metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease later in life."

            "question": "Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) are the third most abundant solid component in breast milk. What is their primary function?",
            "options": [
                "Providing the primary source of calories for the infant.",
                "Acting as prebiotics to support the growth of beneficial Bifidobacteria and protecting against pathogens.",
                "Increasing the fat content of the hindmilk to promote satiety.",
                "Breaking down lactose into glucose and galactose for easier digestion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HMOs are not digestible by the infant; instead, they serve as specialized prebiotics that fuel the infant's microbiome and act as decoy receptors to prevent pathogens from attaching to the intestinal wall."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "The 2015 LEAP (Learning Early About Peanut Allergy) study revolutionized allergy prevention. What was the key finding for high-risk infants?",
            "options": [
                "Delaying peanut introduction until age 3 reduced allergy risk by 50%.",
                "Strict avoidance of all allergens during pregnancy is the most effective prevention strategy.",
                "Introducing peanuts between 4-11 months of age reduced the risk of developing a peanut allergy by up to 81%.",
                "Peanut introduction should only occur after the infant has successfully trialed at least 20 other foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The LEAP study demonstrated that early, rather than delayed, introduction of peanuts to high-risk infants (those with severe eczema or egg allergy) significantly reduced the incidence of peanut allergies."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Iron Gap' is discussed. Approximately what percentage of an infant's iron requirement must be met by complementary foods starting at 6 months of age?",
            "options": [
                "25%",
                "50%",
                "75%",
                "97%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "By 6 months, an infant's iron stores from birth are largely depleted. Because breast milk is naturally low in iron, approximately 97% of the infant's daily iron requirement must come from nutrient-dense complementary foods."

            "question": "A 9-month-old client is struggling to pick up small pieces of steamed carrot. Which developmental milestone should the coach evaluate to determine if the food size is appropriate?",

                "The Palmer Grasp",
                "The Pincer Grasp",
                "The Tongue Thrust Reflex",
                "The Rooting Reflex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pincer Grasp (using thumb and forefinger) typically develops between 8-10 months. If a child hasn't mastered it, they still rely on the Palmer Grasp (using the whole palm), requiring larger, finger-shaped pieces of food rather than small bite-sized bits."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When distinguishing between gagging and choking during Baby-Led Weaning (BLW), which of the following is a sign of a true choking emergency?",
            "options": [
                "The infant is making loud coughing sounds.",
                "The infant's face turns red and their eyes water.",
                "The infant is silent, unable to cry or cough, and may turn blue (cyanosis).",
                "The infant pushes the food forward with their tongue and makes a retching sound."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gagging is a loud, protective reflex where the infant is actively clearing their airway. Choking is a silent, life-threatening blockage where air cannot pass through the trachea."

            "question": "Why is it recommended to limit cow's milk to no more than 16-24 ounces per day for toddlers aged 12-24 months?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive milk intake can displace iron-rich foods and cause intestinal micro-bleeding, leading to iron-deficiency anemia.",
                "Cow's milk contains too much Vitamin C, which interferes with calcium absorption.",
                "Toddlers lack the enzymes to digest more than 16 ounces of lactose per day.",
                "High milk intake is the primary cause of early childhood dental caries."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Overconsumption of cow's milk is a leading cause of 'milk anemia' because it fills the child up (displacing iron-rich solids) and the calcium/casein inhibit the absorption of non-heme iron."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "A postpartum mother is exclusively breastfeeding and asks about her increased caloric needs. Based on Lesson 8, what is the generally recommended daily caloric increase for lactation?",
            "options": [
                "100 - 200 kcal/day",
                "330 - 500 kcal/day",
                "800 - 1,000 kcal/day",
                "No increase is needed if she takes a postnatal vitamin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lactation is metabolically demanding. Most guidelines recommend an additional 330-500 calories per day to support milk production while allowing for gradual postpartum weight loss."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which nutrient, often found in eggs and beef, is highlighted in Lesson 1 as being critical for the structural integrity of fetal cell membranes and hippocampal brain development?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Choline",
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin B6"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline is an essential nutrient during the first 1,000 days. Research shows it plays a vital role in fetal brain structure and long-term memory function (hippocampus development)."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A client wants to start solids at 4 months because their baby is 'watching them eat.' Which set of signs indicates the baby is actually developmentally ready for solids?",
            "options": [
                "Waking up more at night and sucking on fists.",
                "Doubling birth weight and being able to swallow thin purees from a spoon.",
                "Sitting with minimal support, good head control, and the disappearance of the tongue-thrust reflex.",
                "The infant is at least 15 pounds and has at least two bottom teeth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "True developmental readiness involves physiological and motor skills: the ability to sit upright (with minimal help), stable head control to prevent choking, and the loss of the tongue-thrust reflex which otherwise pushes food out of the mouth."
