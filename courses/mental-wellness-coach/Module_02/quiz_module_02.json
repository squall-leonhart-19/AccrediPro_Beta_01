            "question": "In the study of Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), how does chronic activation of the HPA axis specifically impact the immune system's inflammatory response?",
            "options": [
                "It leads to glucocorticoid receptor resistance, causing a failure to downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
                "It permanently increases the production of Natural Killer (NK) cells, leading to autoimmune overactivity.",
                "It causes an immediate and permanent cessation of all white blood cell production.",
                "It decreases the production of C-reactive protein (CRP) to dangerously low levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to glucocorticoid receptor resistance; when receptors become less sensitive to cortisol, the body loses its ability to suppress the inflammatory response, leading to systemic inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "REM sleep is the only time the brain is completely devoid of the anxiety-triggering molecule noradrenaline, allowing for the processing of emotional memories in a neurochemically 'safe' environment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients who cannot identify emotions (Alexithymia), the first step is building the 'bottom-up' pathway of interoception, helping them notice physical sensations which are the precursors to emotional labels."
