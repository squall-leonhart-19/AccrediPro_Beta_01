            "question": "When conducting the Initial Mental Wellness Audit, which domain of the Bio-Psycho-Social model addresses the 'Gut-Brain Axis' and its impact on neurotransmitter production?",
            "options": [
                "The Psychological Domain",
                "The Biological Domain",
                "The Social/Environmental Domain",
                "The Cognitive-Behavioral Domain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Biological domain focuses on physiological factors, including nutrition, gut health (where 95% of serotonin is produced), sleep hygiene, and genetic predispositions."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Stressor Mapping' differentiates between macro-stressors and micro-stressors. According to research (e.g., Almeida, 2005), why are micro-stressors often more damaging to long-term mental wellness?",
            "options": [
                "They trigger a higher peak of cortisol than major life events.",
                "They are easier to ignore, leading to 'allostatic load' or cumulative wear and tear on the body.",
                "They are always rooted in childhood trauma.",
                "They cannot be managed using SMART goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-stressors (daily hassles) have a cumulative effect known as allostatic load. Because they are frequent and often unaddressed, they can cause more chronic physiological strain than isolated major events."

            "question": "When utilizing the GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) scale for baseline metrics, what does a score of 13 indicate regarding the client's status?",
            "options": [
                "Minimal or sub-clinical anxiety",
                "Mild anxiety requiring only lifestyle coaching",
                "Moderate anxiety, suggesting a need for closer monitoring and potential clinical screening",
                "Severe anxiety requiring immediate emergency intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On the GAD-7, scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. A score of 13 falls into the 'Moderate' category."

            "options": [
                "Verbally repeat positive affirmations until they believe them.",
                "Observe their physical micro-expressions while narrating their internal state to bridge the somatic-emotional gap.",
                "Analyze their childhood memories in a dark room.",
                "Compare their physical appearance to societal beauty standards."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mirror Technique uses the visual feedback of one's own face to ground the client in the present moment, making it harder to 'intellectualize' or distance themselves from their actual emotions."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client consistently thinks, 'If I don't get a promotion this year, my entire career is a failure.' This is a classic example of which cognitive loop discussed in Lesson 5?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dichotomous thinking involves viewing situations in only two categories (success or failure) rather than on a continuum, which creates intense pressure and anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Pre-contemplation, the client does not yet see the behavior as a problem. The coach's role is to build awareness (consciousness-raising) rather than pushing for immediate action."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This goal is Specific (meditate), Measurable (10 mins), Attainable (10 mins is realistic), Relevant (reduce cortisol), and Time-bound (7:00 AM for 21 days)."

            "question": "In the Bio-Psycho-Social assessment of a client named 'James' (Case Study, Lesson 6), his social isolation was found to increase his inflammatory markers (IL-6). This demonstrates which principle?",
            "options": [
                "Social factors have no impact on physical biology.",
                "The 'Social' domain can directly influence the 'Bio' domain through physiological stress responses.",
                "James simply needs better time management.",
                "Psychological loops are the only cause of inflammation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The model emphasizes that social health (or lack thereof) triggers biological responses, such as increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, illustrating the interconnectedness of the three domains."

                "The client will become too successful too quickly.",
                "The coach will lose their certification immediately.",
                "The 'Righting Reflex' may cause the client to withdraw or become defensive if they are pushed toward action before they are ready.",
                "There is no risk; all clients are ready for change if they have hired a coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pushing a client into the 'Action' stage when they are still in 'Contemplation' often triggers resistance and the 'Righting Reflex,' where the client argues against the change to maintain autonomy."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "During 'Stressor Mapping,' a client identifies that their heart rate spikes every time they hear a specific Slack notification. This 'Environmental Trigger' is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Conditioned Emotional Response occurs when a neutral stimulus (the notification sound) becomes associated with a stressful event (work pressure), eventually triggering a physiological response on its own."
