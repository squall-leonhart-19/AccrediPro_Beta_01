            "question": "In the lesson on Executive Burnout, which physiological metric is cited as the most reliable indicator of 'Allostatic Load' and autonomic nervous system dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose Levels",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Peak Oxygen Uptake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a primary marker for autonomic balance; low HRV is consistently linked to high allostatic load and executive burnout patterns."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to the Somatic Integration lesson, what is the primary mechanism of 'Central Sensitization' in chronic pain clients?",
            "options": [
                "Permanent damage to peripheral nerve endings",
                "A purely psychological refusal to heal",
                "The nervous system maintaining a state of high reactivity despite the absence of tissue damage",
                "Muscle atrophy caused by lack of exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Central Sensitization occurs when the central nervous system becomes hyper-excitable, processing non-painful stimuli as painful, often linked to unresolved emotional trauma."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "The SMILES trial, discussed in the Nutritional Psychiatry lesson, found that what percentage of participants achieved remission from depression through dietary intervention alone over 12 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "8%",
                "32%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2017 SMILES trial showed that 32% of participants in the dietary support group achieved clinical remission from Major Depressive Disorder, compared to 8% in the social support group."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In the context of Relational Resilience and intergenerational trauma, what does the term 'Enmeshment' refer to?",
            "options": [
                "A healthy state of family bonding",
                "A total lack of communication between generations",
                "Blurred psychological boundaries where individual autonomy is sacrificed for family loyalty",
                "The process of inheriting physical traits from ancestors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Enmeshment is a dysfunctional pattern where family members are over-involved in each other's lives, making it difficult for individuals to develop a separate sense of self."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When coaching a neurodivergent client with ADHD, the 'Double Empathy Problem' suggests that communication breakdowns occur because:",
            "options": [
                "ADHD individuals lack empathy entirely",
                "The coach is not trying hard enough to understand the client",
                "There is a fundamental mismatch in communication styles between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals",
                "Medication has dulled the client's emotional responses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties arise from a reciprocal lack of understanding between different neurotypes, rather than a deficit in the neurodivergent person alone."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In William Bridges' Transition Model (Lesson 6), which phase is described as a 'psychological no-man's land' where the old identity is gone but the new one is not yet formed?",
            "options": [
                "The Ending Phase",
                "The Neutral Zone",

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "For a client in a 'High-Conflict' crisis (Lesson 7), what is the immediate objective of the 'Window of Tolerance' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To identify who is 'right' in the conflict",
                "To process deep childhood wounds immediately",
                "To return the client to a state of physiological arousal where they can process information effectively",
                "To encourage the client to vent their anger loudly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The priority in crisis is stabilization; ensuring the client is within their Window of Tolerance allows them to use their prefrontal cortex rather than reacting from the amygdala."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the 6-Month Mastery Synthesis case study, why is 'Longitudinal Tracking' emphasized over short-term symptom relief?",
            "options": [
                "Short-term relief is impossible to achieve",
                "To identify cyclical patterns and ensure the client has internalized self-regulation skills",
                "To justify higher coaching fees",
                "Because clinical trials only last 6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal tracking allows the coach to see how the client handles setbacks over time, ensuring that 'Mastery' is a sustained state rather than a temporary peak."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Nutritional Psychiatry protocols highlight that approximately 90-95% of which neurotransmitter is produced in the gut?",

                "Dopamine",
                "GABA",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of the body's serotonin is produced by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, emphasizing the importance of the gut-brain axis in mood stability."

                "Increasing social exposure to build 'resilience'",
                "Sensory detox and radical reduction of cognitive load",
                "Standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression",
                "Strict time-management training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic burnout results from chronic over-taxing of the nervous system and 'masking'; recovery requires sensory regulation and removing the demands that led to the collapse."
