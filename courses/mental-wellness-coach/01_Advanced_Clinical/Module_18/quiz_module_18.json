                "The integration must maintain the core 'active ingredients' or fidelity of the underlying research-backed modalities",
                "The integration must be trademarked before it can be used with clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While signature frameworks allow for personalization, they must preserve the mechanisms of action that make the component interventions effective according to scientific literature."
