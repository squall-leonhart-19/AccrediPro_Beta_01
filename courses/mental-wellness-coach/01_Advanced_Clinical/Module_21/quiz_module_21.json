            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Advanced Wellness Planning' (L1), what is the primary reason for prioritizing biological stabilization (Nourish) before cognitive restructuring (Understand)?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive interventions are less effective when the prefrontal cortex is compromised by physiological stress.",
                "Clients prefer physical goals over mental health goals in the initial stages.",
                "Biological interventions are easier to track using wearable technology.",
                "Insurance providers require a 'biological first' approach for reimbursement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neurological research indicates that the prefrontal cortex—responsible for executive function and cognitive reappraisal—is significantly impaired by poor sleep, nutrition, and high cortisol. Stabilizing the 'Biological Core' ensures the client has the neural resources to engage in cognitive work."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When 'Mapping Mental Patterns' (L2), a coach identifies a 'Maladaptive Feedback Loop.' According to the module, what is the first step in sequencing goals for this pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate elimination of the negative behavior.",
                "Identifying the 'Trigger-Response-Reward' sequence to find a pivot point.",
                "Assigning a high-intensity aerobic exercise to distract the client.",
                "Confronting the client's underlying childhood trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessment-driven sequencing requires mapping the specific anatomy of the pattern (Trigger-Response-Reward) before an intervention can be effectively placed at a 'pivot point' to interrupt the cycle."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "The 'Integrate' protocol in Lesson 3 emphasizes Vagal Tone. Which specific statistic was highlighted regarding the relationship between Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and emotional regulation?",
            "options": [
                "HRV has no correlation with emotional resilience.",
                "Higher resting HRV is associated with a 40% faster recovery from acute emotional stressors.",
                "Lower HRV is preferred for high-performance athletes.",
                "HRV only measures physical fitness, not mental wellness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Integrate' protocol utilizes HRV as a biomarker for the 'Integrate' phase; studies show that higher HRV (indicating strong vagal tone) correlates with significantly faster physiological and emotional recovery following stress."

        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, the 'Develop' intervention phase focuses on the 'Window of Tolerance.' If a client is in a state of 'Hyper-arousal,' which intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Challenging their core beliefs through Socratic questioning.",
                "Deep analytical journaling about the cause of the arousal.",
                "Down-regulating somatic techniques like 4-7-8 breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.",
                "Setting high-level career goals to increase motivation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is hyper-aroused (outside the window of tolerance), they are in a sympathetic 'fight/flight' state. Somatic down-regulation is required to return them to a state where cognitive processing can occur."

                "The process of removing toxic people from one's life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Buffering is a biological mechanism where perceived social support lowers the production of cortisol and dampens the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during stressful events."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6 on Risk Management, which of the following scenarios necessitates an immediate 'Crisis Contingency' referral rather than a coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A client reporting they feel 'stressed and overwhelmed' by their new job.",
                "A client expressing 'passive ideation' but having a strong protective factor (e.g., family).",
                "A client presenting with 'intent' and a specific 'plan' for self-harm.",
                "A client who missed two consecutive coaching sessions due to low mood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While passive ideation requires monitoring, the presence of 'intent' and a 'plan' is a clinical emergency that falls outside the scope of coaching and requires immediate referral to emergency services or a licensed mental health professional."

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 introduces 'Pivot Points' in monitoring progress. If a client’s Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) scores have plateaued for 4 weeks despite adherence, what is the recommended action?",
            "options": [
                "Terminate the coaching relationship immediately.",
                "Perform a 'Dynamic Adjustment' by re-assessing the 'Biological Core' or the 'Environmental Scaffolding.'",
                "Tell the client they aren't trying hard enough.",
                "Double the frequency of the current sessions without changing the plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A plateau in outcome measures suggests that the current intervention has reached its limit or that an overlooked factor (often biological or environmental) is acting as a ceiling on progress, requiring a dynamic adjustment."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In the Case Study of 'Marcus' (L8), who struggled with executive burnout, why was 'Purpose' (Lesson 5) addressed last in his Master Plan?",
            "options": [
                "Because purpose is the least important part of mental wellness.",
                "Because Marcus was already satisfied with his career.",
                "Because his high levels of physiological depletion (Burnout) made 'Purpose' work feel like an additional burden rather than a motivator.",
                "Because the coach forgot to include it earlier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In comprehensive conceptualization, high-level constructs like 'Purpose' and 'Meaning' can be overwhelming for a client in acute burnout. These are addressed once the client has the 'Biological' and 'Regulative' capacity to engage with them."

        {
            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between a 'Clinical Treatment Plan' and the 'AccrediPro Wellness Master Plan'?",

                "There is no difference; they are identical.",
                "The Master Plan focuses on pathology and diagnosis.",
                "The Master Plan is a collaborative, holistic framework focusing on optimization and 'scaffolding' across biological, mental, and social domains.",
                "The Master Plan is only used for physical fitness goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While clinical plans focus on the remediation of disorder (pathology), the Wellness Master Plan is an 'Advanced Planning' framework that integrates biological stability, emotional regulation, and environmental scaffolding to move a client toward optimal functioning."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module (n=8,234) found that treatment plans incorporating 'Environmental Scaffolding' (Connection and Purpose) resulted in what increase in long-term goal maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "No measurable increase.",
                "A 10% increase compared to isolated cognitive work.",
                "A 65% higher rate of maintenance over 12 months compared to plans focusing solely on individual habit change.",
                "A 100% success rate for all clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The data demonstrates that mental wellness is not just an 'internal' state; by scaffolding the environment (social connection and purpose), the 'friction' of maintaining new habits is reduced, leading to a 65% higher maintenance rate."
