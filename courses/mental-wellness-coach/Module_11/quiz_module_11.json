            "question": "In the 'D-L Synergy' model of peak performance, what is the primary function of the 'L' component?",
            "options": [
                "Providing the immediate dopamine spike required for task initiation.",
                "Sustaining long-term meaning and purpose to prevent dopamine-driven burnout.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The D-L Synergy balances Dopamine (drive/reward) with Long-term meaning (L). While dopamine provides the 'push,' the L-system ensures the effort is aligned with deeper values, preventing the 'arrival fallacy' and burnout."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the evolutionary oldest response to perceived life threat, manifesting as immobilization, dissociation, or a 'shut down' of non-essential systems."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metacognition allows a client to step back and observe their thought processes as objective events rather than absolute truths, creating the space needed for a conscious, regulated response."
