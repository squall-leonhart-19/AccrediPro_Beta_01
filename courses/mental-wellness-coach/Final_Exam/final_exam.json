        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "A Mental Wellness Coach is working with a client who consistently experiences 'all-or-nothing' thinking. According to the ASCEND Method™, which phase specifically addresses the identification and restructuring of these maladaptive thought patterns?",
            "options": [
                "Assessment & Awareness (A)",
                "Somatic Regulation (S)",
                "Cognitive Reframing (C)",
                "Neuroplastic Habituation (N)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in ASCEND stands for Cognitive Reframing, which focuses on identifying cognitive distortions (like all-or-nothing thinking) and using structured inquiry to replace them with objective perspectives."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "In the ASCEND Method™, why is 'Somatic Regulation' (S) positioned before 'Cognitive Reframing' (C)?",
            "options": [
                "Because physical exercise is more important than mental exercise.",
                "To establish a physiological state of safety in the autonomic nervous system, which is a prerequisite for effective higher-order cognitive work.",
                "Because somatic exercises take less time to master than cognitive ones.",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before addressing their mental health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The methodology prioritizes creating physiological safety (S) so the prefrontal cortex can engage effectively in reframing (C). Without a regulated nervous system, the brain remains in a 'survival' mode, making cognitive change difficult."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'A' (Assessment & Awareness) phase, a coach uses a 'comprehensive audit.' What is the primary goal of this audit?",

                "To provide a list of medications the client should discuss with a doctor.",
                "To identify specific triggers, stressors, and baseline emotional metrics to establish radical self-awareness.",
                "To determine if the client is 'good' or 'bad' at mental wellness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'A' phase is about gathering data on the client's current psychological landscape and identifying unconscious patterns, not clinical diagnosis."

        {
            "id": "final_4",

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that about 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the enteric nervous system (the gut), making nutrition a critical factor in mental wellness."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is driven by repetition and consistency ('neurons that fire together, wire together'). Micro-habits make these changes sustainable and eventually the default response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal arousal zone where a person can manage their emotions. Outside this window, they enter hyperarousal (anxiety) or hypoarousal (numbness)."
