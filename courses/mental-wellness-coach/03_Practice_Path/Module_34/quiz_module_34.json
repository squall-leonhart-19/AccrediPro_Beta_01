            "id": "q34_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of group cohesion (Lesson 1), which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for 'neural synchrony' between a facilitator and participants during a shared narrative?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Cortisol",
                "GABA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin facilitates social bonding and neural synchrony. Research shows that when groups engage in shared emotional experiences, oxytocin levels rise, aligning the brain waves of the facilitator and the group members."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In the MINDFUL Workshop Blueprint (Lesson 2), what does the 'N' in the acronym represent within the curriculum architecture?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'N' stands for Navigation, which refers to providing participants with a clear roadmap of the workshop's journey, reducing cognitive load and 'pre-session anxiety'."

        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A participant in your workshop is consistently 'monopolizing' the conversation, preventing others from sharing. According to Facilitation Mastery (Lesson 3), what is the most effective 'L4' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Directly ask the participant to remain silent for the next 20 minutes.",
                "Use 'Gate-Closing' techniques by validating their point and pivoting to a specific person who hasn't spoken.",
                "Ignore the participant until they realize they are talking too much.",
                "End the session early to reset the group dynamic for the following week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gate-closing involves acknowledging the speaker's contribution ('Thank you for that perspective, John') and immediately opening the gate for others ('I’d love to hear from someone who hasn’t shared yet, perhaps Sarah?')."

            "question": "When integrating somatic practices in public spaces (Lesson 4), what is the primary risk of using high-arousal breathwork in a group setting?",
            "options": [
                "It is too physically demanding for older clients.",
                "It may trigger a 'sympathetic surge' that pushes trauma-sensitive participants outside their Window of Tolerance.",
                "It causes participants to lose focus on the educational content.",
                "It is illegal to perform breathwork in public parks without a medical license."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-arousal somatic work can trigger the sympathetic nervous system. In a group, the facilitator cannot monitor every individual's nervous system as closely as in 1-on-1, risking a dissociative or panic response in sensitive individuals."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 5 (Digital Delivery) suggests that 'Zoom Fatigue' is significantly reduced when facilitators implement which strategy?",

                "Requiring all cameras to be turned off for the duration of the session.",
                "Extending sessions to 90 minutes to allow for more breaks.",
                "Implementing 'Micro-Interactions' (polls, chats, or reactions) every 7-10 minutes.",
                "Using only high-definition 4K video streams."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data shows that active engagement every 7-10 minutes maintains cortical arousal and prevents the 'passive observer' state that leads to digital fatigue."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "In the context of Program Monetization (Lesson 6), what is 'Anchor Pricing' and how is it used effectively?",
            "options": [
                "Pricing a program at $1.00 to attract the maximum number of leads.",
                "Setting a high-priced 'Premium' tier first to make the 'Standard' tier seem more affordable by comparison.",
                "Keeping prices the same for 5 years to build brand loyalty.",
                "Charging participants based on the amount of weight or stress they lose."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor pricing is a psychological strategy where a high-value option (e.g., $1,997) is presented first, making the core offer (e.g., $497) appear significantly more valuable and reasonably priced."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "When measuring group transformation (Lesson 7), a 'Cohen’s d' effect size of 0.8 or higher is generally interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "A negligible or statistically insignificant change.",
                "A small effect that requires a larger sample size.",
                "A moderate effect typical of most wellness programs.",
                "A large, highly significant effect of the intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In behavioral statistics, a Cohen's d of 0.2 is small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 or above is considered a large effect size, indicating the program had a substantial impact."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "Regarding L4 Ethics (Lesson 8), what must a Mental Wellness Coach clarify about confidentiality in a group setting?",
            "options": [
                "The coach can legally guarantee that all participants will keep secrets.",
                "Confidentiality is legally binding for participants just as it is for the coach.",
                "The coach cannot guarantee confidentiality from other participants, only from themselves.",
                "Confidentiality is not necessary in a group wellness setting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the coach is bound by professional ethics, they cannot control the actions of participants. Coaches must explicitly state that while they will maintain privacy, they cannot guarantee the same from other group members."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "During the 'Storming' phase of group development (Lesson 3), what is the facilitator's primary role?",
            "options": [
                "To step back and let the group fail so they learn a lesson.",
                "To suppress all conflict immediately to maintain a positive vibe.",
                "To normalize conflict and facilitate healthy boundary-setting and communication.",
                "To disband the group and start over with new participants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Storming phase is a natural part of Tuckman's stages. The facilitator must guide the group through the friction by modeling healthy communication rather than avoiding the conflict."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Collective Efficacy' mentioned in the module found that groups with high 'Psychological Safety' outperformed others by what percentage in wellness outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "25%",
                "47%",
                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies in group dynamics often show that psychological safety (the belief that one won't be punished for making a mistake) leads to a 25-30% increase in measurable wellness outcomes due to higher engagement and vulnerability."
