            "question": "A Mental Wellness Coach informs a client that their symptoms 'clearly indicate a clinical diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.' Why does this violate the Legal Scope of Practice?",
            "options": [
                "Coaches are only allowed to diagnose anxiety, not depression",
                "Diagnosis is a restricted activity reserved for licensed healthcare professionals under state/provincial law",
                "The coach did not use a validated assessment tool like the PHQ-9",
                "It is only a violation if the coach charges for the diagnosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaching is a non-clinical profession. Providing a clinical diagnosis constitutes the unauthorized practice of medicine or psychology, which can lead to legal prosecution and loss of insurance coverage."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), what is the 'Right to Erasure' (Article 17) and how does it apply to coaches?",
            "options": [
                "Clients can demand all their data be deleted immediately, regardless of legal record-keeping requirements",
                "Coaches must delete client data every 12 months automatically",
                "Clients may request data deletion, but this is often superseded by legal mandates to retain records for liability purposes (typically 7 years)",
                "The Right to Erasure only applies to physical paper files, not digital data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While GDPR grants the right to erasure, Article 17(3) provides exceptions for compliance with legal obligations or the establishment/defense of legal claims, which includes professional record retention periods."

            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "What is the critical difference between an 'Occurrence' policy and a 'Claims-made' policy in professional liability insurance?",
            "options": [
                "An Occurrence policy covers incidents that happen during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is filed",
                "A Claims-made policy is generally more expensive than an Occurrence policy",
                "An Occurrence policy only covers claims filed while the policy is active",
                "Claims-made policies do not require 'tail' coverage when switching providers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Occurrence policies provide long-term protection for any event that occurred while the policy was active. Claims-made policies only cover claims if both the incident and the claim occur while the policy is active (unless a 'tail' is purchased)."

                "The 'Duty to Warn' third parties when a client poses a serious threat of physical violence to an identifiable victim",
                "The requirement for coaches to have a Master's degree",
                "The legality of providing coaching services across state lines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Tarasoff ruling established that the protective privilege of confidentiality ends where the public peril begins, creating a legal duty to warn potential victims of violence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'No Guarantees' clause explicitly states that coaching outcomes depend on the client's participation and external factors, protecting the coach from breach-of-contract claims regarding specific results."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A coach based in California works with a client in France via Zoom. Which jurisdictional laws regarding data privacy must the coach follow?",
