            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Disconnection and Rejection domain includes schemas like Abandonment/Instability and Mistrust/Abuse, where the client fundamentally doubts the reliability of safety and nurturance in relationships."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the science of Somatic Interoception (L2), which brain region acts as the primary 'hub' for integrating internal bodily sensations into a conscious sense of self?",

            "options": [
                "Because it identifies gut microbiome diversity",
                "Because it provides a quantitative measure of vagal tone and stress resilience",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV biofeedback is the primary tool for 'Understanding' and regulating the autonomic nervous system, specifically tracking the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Rigid' boundaries, refusing to share any personal information and isolating themselves during stress. According to the Boundary Architecture lesson (L5), this is often a compensatory mechanism for which internal state?",
