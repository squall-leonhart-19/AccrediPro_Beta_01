            "options": [
                "The Activating Event (A)",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to the ABC model, it is not the event itself (A) that causes the consequence (C), but rather the individual's beliefs (B) or interpretation of that event."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "All-or-nothing thinking involves seeing things in black-and-white categories. If a performance falls short of perfect, the person sees it as a total failure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Socratic questioning focuses on empirical evidence. Asking for evidence for and against a thought helps the client objectively evaluate its validity rather than just seeking positive alternatives."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Externalization is a technique where the problem is treated as an outside influence (e.g., 'The Anxiety' rather than 'I am anxious'), which reduces shame and increases the client's agency to address it."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the ABCDE model, 'D' stands for Disputation, where the client is encouraged to challenge and dispute the irrational beliefs identified in step 'B'."

            "options": [
                "They magically attract positive outcomes",
                "They strengthen neural pathways, making the new perspective more 'automatic' through neuroplasticity",
                "They suppress the prefrontal cortex",
                "They eliminate the possibility of future negative thoughts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to reorganize itself. By consistently practicing new thought patterns, the synaptic connections for those patterns strengthen, eventually making them the default response."
