            "question": "Ann Masten (2001) famously described resilience as 'Ordinary Magic.' What is the core scientific implication of this term?",
            "options": [
                "Resilience is a rare, heroic trait found only in exceptional individuals.",
                "Resilience arises from common, everyday adaptive systems rather than extraordinary processes.",
                "Resilience is a mystical quality that cannot be measured by psychological assessments.",
                "Resilience is only possible if an individual has never experienced significant trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Masten's 'Ordinary Magic' concept emphasizes that resilience is the result of basic human adaptational systems, such as cognitive development and social support, rather than rare or special qualities."

            "question": "A client is practicing 'Cognitive Reappraisal' after a failed project. According to research on cognitive flexibility, how does this differ from 'Expressive Suppression'?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression changes the internal meaning, while reappraisal hides outward signs.",
                "Reappraisal occurs earlier in the emotion-generative process and reduces physiological arousal more effectively.",
                "Suppression is more effective for long-term mental health outcomes.",
                "Reappraisal involves ignoring the problem entirely to focus on positive thoughts."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reappraisal is an antecedent-focused strategy that changes the trajectory of an emotional response before it is fully triggered, whereas suppression is response-focused and often leads to higher physiological stress."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In the 'Window of Tolerance' model (Dan Siegel), a client experiencing a 'shut down' response, feeling numb, and having a low heart rate is likely in which state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by a 'freeze' response, emotional numbness, and a slowing of physiological processes, occurring when the nervous system is overwhelmed by stress."

            "options": [
                "A steady, unchanging heart rate during inhalation and exhalation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a primary physiological marker of Vagal Tone and the 'Resilience Reserve,' reflecting a flexible and responsive autonomic nervous system."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Research on the 'Negativity Bias' suggests that humans are evolutionarily hardwired to prioritize negative information. What is the 'Losada Ratio' often cited as the threshold for flourishing in relationships and teams?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 (One positive for every one negative)",

                "10:1 (Ten positives for every one negative)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While debated in exact numbers, the 3:1 ratio (Gottman uses 5:1 for marriages) is the widely accepted benchmark in positive psychology for overcoming the negativity bias and achieving a state of flourishing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery experiences—the direct experience of overcoming a challenge—provide the strongest evidence for an individual that they have what it takes to succeed, thereby building the highest levels of self-efficacy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying and challenging cognitive distortions (like 'all-or-nothing thinking') is a core component of cognitive flexibility, allowing the client to reappraise the situation more accurately."
