            "question": "In Martin Seligman’s PERMA model of well-being, which component refers to the subjective feeling of being 'at one' with an activity, often resulting in the loss of self-consciousness?",
            "options": ["Positive Emotion", "Engagement", "Relationships", "Accomplishment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Engagement (E) in the PERMA model refers to flow and the state of being fully absorbed in a task, where time seems to stop and the self-consciousness fades."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Research by Linley et al. (2010) suggests that individuals who use their 'Signature Strengths' daily are how many times more likely to report being 'flourishing' compared to those who do not?",
            "options": ["1.5 times", "9 times", "18 times", "3 times"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on the VIA Character Strengths indicate that using signature strengths (those top 5-7 strengths) is a massive predictor of flourishing, with some data suggesting up to an 18x increase in reported well-being."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s Flow Model, what occurs when a client faces a high-level challenge but possesses low-level skills for that specific task?",
            "options": ["Flow State", "Boredom", "Anxiety", "Apathy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flow requires a balance between challenge and skill. When the challenge is high but the skill is low, the individual experiences anxiety. If both are high, they reach Flow."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis (n=12,450) on gratitude interventions found that the 'Three Good Things' exercise significantly reduced depressive symptoms. What is the biological mechanism believed to drive this change?",
            "options": ["Suppression of the amygdala and activation of the medial prefrontal cortex", "Increased cortisol production in the adrenal glands", "Decreased neuroplasticity in the hippocampus", "Inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Gratitude practices are shown to regulate the 'threat' center (amygdala) and enhance the 'executive' center (mPFC), leading to better emotional regulation and reduced depressive symptoms."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "How does Eudaimonic well-being differ from Hedonic well-being in a clinical coaching context?",
            "options": ["Eudaimonia focuses on short-term pleasure and comfort.", "Eudaimonia is centered on personal growth, meaning, and realizing one's potential.", "Hedonia is the only form of happiness that correlates with physical health.", "There is no difference; they are synonymous in positive psychology."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hedonic well-being is about pleasure and pain avoidance, while Eudaimonic well-being (derived from Aristotle) is about 'human flourishing' through meaning and purpose."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Plan' in WOOP uses Implementation Intentions (If [Obstacle] happens, then I will [Action]) to automate behavior, which is more effective than visualization alone."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In the 'Psychology of Success,' Carol Dweck identifies the 'Growth Mindset.' Which of the following is a hallmark behavior of an individual with a Growth Mindset in a high-pressure environment?",

            "question": "According to the 'Happiness Pie Chart' (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005), what percentage of the variance in human happiness is determined by 'Intentional Activity' (factors within a person's control)?",
            "options": ["10%", "40%", "50%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "explanation": "Sarah is experiencing a lack of meaning (Eudaimonia). Values clarification and purpose-driven work help bridge the gap between 'comfort' and 'fulfillment.'"
