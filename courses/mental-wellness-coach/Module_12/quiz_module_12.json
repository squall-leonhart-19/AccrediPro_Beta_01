            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BDNF acts as 'fertilizer' for the brain, supporting the survival of existing neurons and encouraging the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses."

            "question": "In the study of Social Genomics (F Pillar), research by Cole et al. (2015) found that individuals with high levels of 'Eudaimonic' well-being showed which genetic profile?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eudaimonic well-being (purpose-driven) is associated with a favorable CTRA profile, characterized by lower pro-inflammatory gene expression and higher antiviral gene expression compared to purely hedonic well-being."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the gold standard for short-term HRV measurements (e.g., 2-5 minutes) as it captures the high-frequency variations associated with vagal tone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MINDFUL™ framework requires addressing the specific deficit identified; since 'F' represents Frequency of Connection/Social Brain, social engagement is the targeted intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the common myth says 21 days, Lally's research demonstrated that it takes an average of 66 days for a behavior to become an automatic habit, with a range of 18 to 254 days."
