            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract rather than the brain?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "40-50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 90-95% of serotonin is produced by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, highlighting the critical role of the microbiome in regulating mood and emotional signaling via the vagus nerve."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Which physiological mechanism explains why rapid drops in blood sugar (reactive hypoglycemia) often manifest as irritability and anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "The sudden surge of epinephrine and cortisol to mobilize glucose stores",
                "The inhibition of the amygdala by insulin",
                "A decrease in the production of gastric acid",
                "The rapid accumulation of lactic acid in the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops rapidly, the body triggers a counter-regulatory hormonal response, releasing adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol, which can induce feelings of panic, irritability, and 'hangry' behavior."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels (>3 mg/L) are strongly associated with systemic inflammation and have been shown to predict lower efficacy of SSRIs in patients with depression."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "When recommending Omega-3 supplementation for mood support, clinical evidence suggests which ratio or component is most effective for anti-inflammatory effects in the brain?",
            "options": [
                "A 1:1 ratio of EPA to DHA",
                "High-dose DHA (at least 2000mg)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses suggest that Omega-3 supplements with a higher ratio of EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) compared to DHA are more effective for treating depressive symptoms due to EPA's superior anti-inflammatory properties."

            "question": "How does the practice of 'Mindful Eating' directly influence the digestive process and the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the speed of gastric emptying to prevent bloating",
                "It activates the parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest) and enhances the cephalic phase of digestion",
                "It reduces the production of salivary amylase",
                "It shifts the gut microbiome toward a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindful eating shifts the body into a parasympathetic state, which optimizes the cephalic phase of digestion (enzyme release and blood flow to the gut), leading to better nutrient absorption and reduced GI distress."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that even 1.36% dehydration in women and similar levels in men lead to degraded mood, increased perception of task difficulty, lower concentration, and increased headache frequency."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which substance, often produced by gut bacteria during the fermentation of fiber, acts as a signaling molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier to improve neuroplasticity?",
            "options": [
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",
                "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like Butyrate",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, are produced by the fermentation of prebiotic fibers and have neuroprotective effects, including the stimulation of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)."

            "question": "A client complains of 'brain fog' and a 'crash' every afternoon at 3:00 PM. They typically eat a large pasta salad with fat-free dressing for lunch. What is the most likely nutritional culprit?",
            "options": [
                "Too much fiber from the vegetables",
                "A lack of electrolytes in the pasta",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high-carbohydrate meal (pasta) without adequate protein or healthy fats leads to a rapid glucose spike and subsequent insulin surge, resulting in reactive hypoglycemia, which manifests as brain fog and fatigue."

            "id": "q9_10",
