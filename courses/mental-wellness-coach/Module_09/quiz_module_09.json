            "question": "In the context of Neuroplasticity and Habit Architecture, what is the primary function of myelination during the 'stabilization' phase of a new habit?",
            "options": [
                "To trigger the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex",
                "To insulate the axon, increasing the speed and efficiency of neural signal transmission",
                "To prune unused synaptic connections to make room for new data",
                "To decrease the metabolic cost of the amygdala's fear response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myelination is the process of coating axons in a fatty sheath, which significantly increases the speed (up to 100x) and efficiency of neural signals, effectively 'hard-wiring' a habit into the brain's architecture."

                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies in Advanced Nutritional Psychology show that 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, highlighting the critical role of microbiome health in mood regulation and mental wellness."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the 'newer' myelinated branch of the vagus nerve that facilitates social bonding, facial expression, and the 'rest and digest' state associated with safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic Load is measured through a composite of neuroendocrine (cortisol), immune (CRP), and cardiovascular (BP, cholesterol) markers that reflect the cumulative biological cost of chronic stress adaptation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The four pillars of Ikigai are: What you love, What you are good at, What the world needs, and What you can be paid for. Family expectations are an external pressure, not a core pillar of the framework."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": [
                "Using willpower to eliminate the 'Cue' entirely",
                "Keeping the 'Cue' and 'Reward' the same, but substituting the 'Routine' with a healthier behavior",
                "Eliminating the 'Reward' so the brain learns to dislike the habit",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Rule of Habit Change' states that it is easier to change a habit by keeping the cue (e.g., stress at 9 PM) and the reward (e.g., relaxation), but replacing the routine (e.g., eating cookies) with a new one (e.g., tea and a book)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where a person is able to process information and emotions effectively. If they are hyper-aroused or hypo-aroused, the prefrontal cortex goes offline, making coaching interventions ineffective."
