            "question": "In the synthesis of Serotonin, which amino acid serves as the primary precursor, and which micronutrient is a mandatory cofactor for the initial rate-limiting enzyme?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tyrosine; Vitamin B12",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Serotonin is synthesized from L-Tryptophan. The process requires Vitamin B6 (as P5P), Iron, and Magnesium as essential cofactors for the enzymes tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client experiences 'reactive hypoglycemia' approximately two hours after consuming a high-glycemic meal. Which hormonal response is most likely responsible for their sudden symptoms of irritability and anxiety?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops too rapidly (reactive hypoglycemia), the body triggers a 'fight-or-flight' response, releasing adrenaline and cortisol to mobilize glucose, which manifests as anxiety, shakiness, and irritability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium acts as a 'gatekeeper' for the NMDA receptor. It sits in the receptor channel to prevent excessive calcium influx, thereby protecting neurons from excitotoxicity and reducing feelings of anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
