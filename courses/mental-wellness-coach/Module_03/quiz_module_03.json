            "question": "Which branch of the Autonomic Nervous System is primarily responsible for the 'rest and digest' state, facilitated by the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "Enteric Nervous System",
                "Somatic Motor System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) promotes relaxation, digestion, and recovery, primarily using acetylcholine to signal the body to slow down and conserve energy."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a key metric for vagal tone. According to the module, what does a high HRV generally indicate in a client?",
            "options": [
                "High levels of chronic stress and poor recovery",
                "An overactive sympathetic 'fight or flight' response",

                "A dangerous cardiac arrhythmia requiring immediate referral"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates that the heart is responsive to both branches of the ANS, signifying better emotional regulation and the ability to bounce back from stressors."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 4-7-8 technique, developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, acts as a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system by emphasizing a long hold and an even longer exhale."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exteroception is the sensitivity to stimuli originating outside of the body. By engaging the five senses, the client moves out of a 'thought loop' and back into the physical environment."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) relies on the 'rebound effect.' What does this physiological mechanism entail?",
            "options": [
                "Muscles become more tense after a period of relaxation",
                "The brain ignores signals from the muscles during stress",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Jacobson’s PMR technique teaches the brain to recognize the difference between tension and relaxation, with the release phase triggering a deeper state of 'rebound' relaxation."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A 2019 study cited in the module suggests that a diet high in refined sugars can cause 'somatic instability.' What is the primary mechanism for this effect?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blood sugar crashes (hypoglycemia) trigger the HPA axis to release stress hormones to mobilize more glucose, which the body often interprets as a state of anxiety or threat."

                "It increases the production of lactic acid in the muscles",
                "It prevents the Vagus Nerve from firing too frequently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a protein that helps repair brain cells and grow new ones, which is essential for overcoming the 'brain fog' and cognitive decline associated with chronic depression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the nervous system’s 'surveillance' system that scans for cues of safety or danger without involving the conscious, thinking mind."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is 'shut down' (Dorsal Vagal), aggressive interventions can be perceived as further threats. Gentle, safe sensory engagement helps them move back toward the ventral vagal state."
