            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cognitive-Emotional Loop illustrates how thoughts trigger the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline."

            ],

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Map-Maker's Mindset' in Lesson 6, what is the primary function of Meta-Cognition in a coaching session?",
            "options": [
                "To judge the client's thoughts as 'good' or 'bad'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-cognition is the ability to monitor and observe one's own thought processes without judgment, allowing the client to become an objective 'map-maker' of their mind."

                "ANTs are deep-seated; Schemas are surface-level",
                "ANTs are situational reactions; Schemas are the underlying 'rules' or filters",
                "ANTs are always true; Schemas are always false",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in coaching"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ANTs are the immediate, reflexive thoughts that pop into the mind, while Schemas (Core Beliefs) are the deeper, enduring structures that generate those thoughts."

            "id": "q1_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Thread' is the recurring pattern or core schema that links seemingly unrelated thoughts, triggers, and maladaptive behaviors together."

            "id": "q1_9",

                "The Hippocampus",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Lieberman et al., 2007) show that labeling emotions activates the PFC, which in turn dampens the 'threat' response in the amygdala."

                "To give the client time to run away from the situation",
                "To allow the Prefrontal Cortex to engage before an impulsive reaction occurs",
                "To wait for the trigger to disappear on its own",
                "To ensure the coach has time to intervene"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' is the critical moment between a stimulus and a response where meta-cognition allows the executive brain (PFC) to choose a conscious action over a reflexive reaction."
