            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90-95% of serotonin is produced in the gut. While it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier directly, it influences the brain via the vagus nerve and systemic signaling, making gut health a pillar of mastery-level coaching."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As defined by Nassim Taleb and applied in L4, resilience is the ability to recover (return to baseline), whereas antifragility is the ability to improve (surpass baseline) because of the stressor."
