            "options": [
                "Situational crises are triggered by external, often sudden events like job loss or natural disasters, while maturational crises relate to predictable life transitions like retirement.",
                "Situational crises are always chronic, whereas maturational crises are always acute and short-term.",
                "Maturational crises require immediate psychiatric hospitalization, while situational crises only require coaching.",
                "Situational crises are internal biological shifts, while maturational crises are caused by environmental stressors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Situational crises arise from external events (unanticipated), whereas maturational crises are part of the normal human growth process and life cycle transitions."

                "The client's stated desire to act on their thoughts, regardless of whether a specific plan is finalized.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intent refers to the client's actual desire or 'readiness' to act on thoughts, which is a higher risk level than simply having a method (plan) without the immediate desire to execute it."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "STS is specific to the 'cost of caring' for traumatized individuals and mirrors PTSD symptoms, whereas burnout is a broader response to chronic workplace stressors and exhaustion."
