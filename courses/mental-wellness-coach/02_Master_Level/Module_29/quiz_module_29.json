            "question": "In the M.I.N.D.F.U.L. Method™ synthesis, what does the 'Unified Field' concept suggest regarding the seven pillars?",
            "options": [
                "The pillars function as a linear checklist where one must be completed before the next.",
                "The pillars are emergent properties where the total wellness effect is greater than the sum of individual interventions.",
                "Only the 'M' (Mindset) and 'N' (Nutrition) pillars are required for clinical-level results.",
                "Each pillar should be treated as a silo to avoid cognitive overwhelm for the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Unified Field theory in Master Integration posits that the pillars are non-linear and synergistic; when integrated, they create an emergent state of wellness that exceeds the impact of any single pillar used in isolation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC is critical for Advanced Neuro-Mapping as it provides the top-down inhibitory control over the amygdala, allowing clients to transition from reactive states to proactive mindset regulation."
