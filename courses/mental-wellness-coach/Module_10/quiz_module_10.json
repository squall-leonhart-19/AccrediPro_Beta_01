            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is the 'smart' vagus, unique to mammals, which facilitates social connection, safety, and the active inhibition of the fight-or-flight response."

                "To block the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a protein that promotes neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, essentially acting as a growth factor that enables the brain to rewire itself through experience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on 'who' the person is becoming (the identity) rather than the outcome (the weight loss), which creates a deeper internal drive for consistency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. High interoceptive awareness allows clients to catch stress signals early before they escalate into emotional dysregulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is in a Dorsal Vagal state (freeze/faint), they need to be gently moved back into a state of safety (Ventral Vagal) before higher-level cognitive work or high-intensity activity can be effective."
