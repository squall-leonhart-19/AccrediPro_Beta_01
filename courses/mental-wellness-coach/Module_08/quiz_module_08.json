            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels is neurotoxic to the hippocampus, leading to dendritic atrophy and reduced neurogenesis, which impairs memory and emotional regulation."

                "It has no effect on melatonin if the eyes are closed",
                "It suppresses melatonin production via the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Short-wavelength blue light is detected by melanopsin-containing cells in the retina, which signal the SCN to suppress melatonin, thereby increasing alertness and delaying sleep."
