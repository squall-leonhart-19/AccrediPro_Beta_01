            "question": "According to Hebbian Theory, which is a fundamental principle of neuroplasticity, what occurs when two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time?",
            "options": [
                "The synaptic connection between them is weakened to allow for new learning.",
                "The metabolic cost of firing increases, leading to neural pruning.",
                "The synaptic connection between them is strengthened, making future activation more efficient.",
                "The neurons undergo apoptosis to make room for more resilient neural pathways."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory states that 'neurons that fire together, wire together,' meaning repeated simultaneous activation strengthens the synaptic bond, a process essential for habit formation."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In the habit loop model (Cue, Routine, Reward), which component is primarily responsible for the 'craving' that drives the behavior in future cycles?",
            "options": [
                "The Routine, as it provides the physical movement.",
                "The Reward, as the brain anticipates the neurochemical payoff associated with the cue.",
                "The Cue, as it is the only external stimulus required.",
                "The Habituation Phase, which occurs after the routine is completed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The brain begins to associate the cue with the reward, creating a dopamine-driven craving that occurs before the routine even begins."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 94 studies (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) showed that 'Implementation Intentions' significantly increase goal attainment. What is the correct structure for this technique?",
            "options": [
                "I will [Behavior] because I want to achieve [Goal].",
                "If [Situation X] occurs, then I will [Response Y].",
                "I promise to [Behavior] every day at [Time].",
                "I will visualize [Success] to overcome [Obstacle]."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation intentions use an 'If-Then' format to link a specific situational cue with a pre-planned goal-directed response, reducing the need for conscious willpower."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which neurobiological process is described as the 'insulation' of neural pathways, increasing the speed and efficiency of electrical impulses in well-practiced habits?",
            "options": [
                "Myelination",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Myelination is the process of coating axons in a fatty substance (myelin), which speeds up neural transmission and is a key physical change in the brain during habit mastery."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Regarding the role of dopamine in motivation, what does the 'Reward Prediction Error' (RPE) signify?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine is only released when a reward is physically consumed.",
                "The difference between the expected reward and the actual reward received.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RPE is the difference between received and predicted rewards. A positive error (better than expected) triggers a dopamine spike, reinforcing the habit loop."

            "options": [
                "After I finish my morning coffee, I will meditate for five minutes.",
                "I will meditate for five minutes whenever I feel stressed during the day.",
                "I will meditate for five minutes in the morning and exercise in the evening.",
                "I will stop drinking coffee and start meditating instead."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking identifies a current habit (morning coffee) and uses it as the 'cue' for the new habit (meditation), leveraging existing neural pathways."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the 'What-the-Hell Effect' (counter-regulatory behavior) is described. What is the primary psychological driver of this phenomenon during a relapse?",
            "options": [
                "A physical addiction to the substance or behavior.",
                "A lack of physiological glucose in the brain.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'What-the-Hell Effect' occurs when people treat a small lapse as a total failure of their goals, leading to further indulgence as they abandon their self-control temporarily."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which concept from Lesson 7 (Micro-Habits) is essential for overcoming the 'Activation Energy' required to start a new behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the difficulty of the task to build mental toughness.",
                "Making the habit 'too small to fail' (e.g., doing one push-up).",
                "Focusing exclusively on the long-term macro-results.",
                "Using external rewards like food or money for every completion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-habits reduce the 'activation energy' by making the routine so small that it requires negligible willpower, ensuring consistency even on low-motivation days."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Long-term Potentiation (LTP) is the persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. What is its primary role in the 'N' of the ASCEND model?",
            "options": [
                "It serves as the mechanism that makes wellness behaviors the 'default' or automatic response.",
                "It is the process by which the brain forgets traumatic memories.",
                "It identifies the specific moment a client is ready to terminate coaching.",
                "It measures the amount of cortisol released during a stressful event."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LTP is the cellular basis for learning and memory; in habituation, it turns intentional actions into automatic, 'default' neural patterns."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When a client faces 'Resistance' during habit formation, which brain region is typically responsible for the 'fight-or-flight' urge to return to old, comfortable patterns?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The amygdala perceives the change and discomfort of a new habit as a threat, triggering resistance. Successful habituation involves the Prefrontal Cortex 'calming' this response over time."
