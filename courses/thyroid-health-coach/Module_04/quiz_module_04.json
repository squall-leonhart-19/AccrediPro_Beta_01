            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which pro-inflammatory cytokine is most specifically associated with the inhibition of the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, leading to reduced peripheral conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)",
                "Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β)",
                "Interleukin-4 (IL-4)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TNF-α and IL-6 are primary pro-inflammatory cytokines that suppress the activity of 5'-deiodinase, the enzyme responsible for converting inactive T4 into active T3 in peripheral tissues, often leading to 'euthyroid sick syndrome' or localized tissue hypothyroidism."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of molecular mimicry, why is gluten specifically problematic for patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis?",
            "options": [
                "Gluten contains high amounts of iodine that overstimulate the gland.",
                "The protein structure of gliadin closely resembles the molecular structure of the thyroid gland.",
                "Gluten increases stomach acid, which destroys thyroid medication.",
                "Gluten directly binds to TSH receptors, blocking hormone production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs because the protein structure of gliadin (a component of gluten) shares structural similarities with thyroid tissue. When the immune system creates antibodies against gliadin, those antibodies may cross-react with the thyroid gland (TPO or TG proteins)."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "During the 'Reintroduction Phase' of the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP), what is the recommended timeframe for monitoring symptoms after introducing a single new food?",
            "options": [
                "12 hours",
                "24 hours",
                "3 to 7 days",
                "Exactly 14 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AIP protocols typically recommend waiting 3 to 7 days between reintroducing new foods. This is because IgG-mediated sensitivities and inflammatory responses can be delayed, and the practitioner needs to observe both immediate and latent reactions."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A 2021 study on glycemic control found that patients with higher HOMA-IR (Insulin Resistance) scores were significantly more likely to present with which thyroid condition?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid nodules and increased thyroid volume",
                "Congenital hypothyroidism",
                "Excessively high T3 levels (Hyperthyroidism)",
                "Complete atrophy of the thyroid gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a strong correlation between hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance and increased thyroid volume as well as the formation of thyroid nodules, likely due to the mitogenic effects of insulin on thyroid cells."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which an excessive intake of Omega-6 fatty acids (specifically Linoleic Acid) promotes thyroid inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of series-1 prostaglandins",
                "By acting as a precursor to arachidonic acid and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids",
                "By blocking the absorption of dietary iodine in the small intestine",
                "By decreasing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Excessive Omega-6 fatty acids, common in industrial seed oils, are precursors to arachidonic acid, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (like PGE2) that exacerbate systemic and thyroid-specific inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which protein is responsible for modulating the permeability of tight junctions in the intestinal lining and is often elevated in 'Leaky Gut' scenarios?",
            "options": [
                "Albumin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Hemoglobin",
                "Ferritin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels of zonulin are associated with increased intestinal permeability, allowing LPS and food antigens to enter the bloodstream and trigger an immune response."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "To minimize the goitrogenic effect of cruciferous vegetables (like kale or broccoli) while retaining their anti-cancer phytonutrients, which preparation method is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Eating them raw in large quantities",
                "Juicing them to concentrate the liquid",
                "Lightly steaming or boiling them",
                "Fermenting them for at least 3 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heat (steaming or boiling) deactivates the enzyme myrosinase, which reduces the conversion of glucosinolates into goitrin, the compound that interferes with iodine uptake. This allows thyroid patients to enjoy these nutrient-dense foods safely."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A client on AIP reintroduces eggs and experiences joint pain and brain fog 48 hours later. According to the framework, what is the correct next step?",
            "options": [
                "Continue eating eggs daily until the symptoms disappear.",
                "Immediately introduce dairy to see if it cancels out the egg reaction.",
                "Remove eggs again and wait until symptoms completely resolve before testing a different food.",
                "Increase thyroid medication dosage to compensate for the flare."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a reintroduction triggers symptoms, the food should be removed immediately. The practitioner must wait until the client returns to their 'baseline' (symptom-free state) before attempting to reintroduce any other food groups."

            "options": [
                "Calcium and Vitamin K2",
                "L-Glutamine, Zinc Carnosine, and Quercetin",
                "Iron and Vitamin C",
                "High-dose Caffeine and Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Glutamine provides fuel for enterocytes, Zinc Carnosine has been shown to stabilize small bowel integrity, and Quercetin acts as a mast cell stabilizer, making them a potent triad for gut repair."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Golden Ratio' of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids that health coaches should aim for to support an anti-inflammatory state, compared to the 15:1 ratio found in the standard Western diet?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 to 4:1",
                "10:1 to 12:1",
                "50:1",
                "1:50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anthropological research suggests humans evolved on a ratio of approximately 1:1. For therapeutic anti-inflammatory purposes, maintaining a ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 is considered optimal for reducing the risk of chronic inflammatory diseases."
