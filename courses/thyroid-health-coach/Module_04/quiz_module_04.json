        {
            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which protein is responsible for modulating the permeability of tight junctions in the intestinal lining, often serving as the primary trigger for the gut-thyroid-immune cascade?",
            "options": [
                "Zonulin",
                "Occludin",
                "Thyroglobulin",
                "Gastrin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; elevated levels lead to intestinal permeability (leaky gut), allowing antigens to enter the bloodstream and trigger autoimmunity."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry occurs in Hashimoto's because the immune system confuses the protein structure of alpha-gliadin (gluten) with which thyroid-specific enzyme?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Deiodinase Type 2",
                "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "Iodine Symporter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Due to structural similarities in amino acid sequences, antibodies produced against gliadin can cross-react with Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO), leading to autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A 2014 study published in the 'Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism' found that what percentage of hypothyroid patients also tested positive for SIBO?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "34%",
                "54%",
                "78%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 54% of hypothyroid patients have SIBO, likely due to slowed gastrointestinal motility which allows for bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "How does an H. pylori infection specifically impact the management of hypothyroidism in patients taking Levothyroxine?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the rate of T4 to T3 conversion in the liver",
                "It lowers gastric pH, causing the medication to dissolve too quickly",
                "It raises gastric pH (hypochlorhydria), necessitating higher doses of T4 for absorption",
                "It directly binds to TSH receptors, mimicking the hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "H. pylori causes atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid). Since Levothyroxine requires an acidic environment for optimal dissolution and absorption, infected patients often require significantly higher doses."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total T4 to T3 conversion is estimated to occur in a healthy gut via the action of intestinal bacteria?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "About 20% of T4 is converted into the active T3 form in the gut by the enzyme intestinal sulfatase, which is produced by beneficial commensal bacteria."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In the 5-R Gut Restoration Framework, the 'Replace' step primarily focuses on which of the following interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating pathogenic bacteria and parasites",
                "Introducing high-dose multi-strain probiotics",
                "Supplementing with digestive enzymes, bile salts, or Betaine HCl",
                "Using L-glutamine and zinc carnosine to seal the gut lining"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Replace' phase focuses on restoring digestive secretions like stomach acid and enzymes that may be deficient, which is critical for mineral absorption in thyroid patients."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which occult viral infection is most strongly associated with 'bystander activation,' where the virus resides in thyroid tissue and triggers a localized autoimmune response?",
            "options": [
                "Herpes Simplex 1 (HSV-1)",
                "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)",

                "Human Papillomavirus (HPV)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBV has been found in the thyroid cells of Hashimoto's patients. The immune system's attempt to attack the virus leads to collateral damage of the thyroid tissue, a process known as bystander activation."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) is a common 'hidden' root cause that leads to deficiencies in which two nutrients essential for thyroid function?",

                "Vitamin A and Copper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron and Vitamin B12 both require adequate gastric acid for cleavage from proteins and subsequent absorption; both are critical for thyroid hormone synthesis and cellular energy."

            "question": "According to the Lesson 8 Case Study, why did the client's 'brain fog' and fatigue persist despite 'normal' TSH levels while on T4-only medication?",
            "options": [
                "She was not taking her medication with enough water",
                "Persistent intestinal permeability and LPS translocation were causing systemic inflammation",
                "She was consuming too much iodine from seaweed",
                "She was over-exercising and suppressing her TSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that even with 'normal' labs, systemic inflammation from 'leaky gut' and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins can cross the blood-brain barrier, causing persistent neurological symptoms."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which specific fungal overgrowth can produce metabolites that interfere with the liver's ability to detoxify estrogen, indirectly worsening thyroid symptoms through increased Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG)?",
            "options": [
                "Candida albicans",
                "Aspergillus",
                "Saccharomyces boulardii",
                "Stachybotrys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Candida overgrowth can lead to increased 'estrogen dominance' by interfering with liver detoxification. High estrogen increases TBG levels, which binds to free thyroid hormones, making them unavailable to cells."
