            "question": "A client presents with a heart rate of 145 bpm, a temperature of 103.5°F, and acute agitation. According to the triage protocols in Lesson 1, which emergency condition should be suspected?",
            "options": [
                "Myxedema Coma",
                "Thyroid Storm",
                "Acute Panic Disorder",
                "Hashimoto's Encephalopathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Storm is a life-threatening hypermetabolic state characterized by high fever, tachycardia, and central nervous system dysfunction, requiring immediate emergency medical intervention."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2's discussion of the 'Non-Responder,' what is identified as the primary driver of metabolic resistance when TSH and T4 levels appear clinically 'optimal'?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient iodine intake",
                "Excessive cardiovascular exercise",
                "Cellular hypothyroidism and leptin resistance",
                "Over-suppression of TSH by T4-only medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic resistance often stems from cellular-level issues where the thyroid hormone cannot reach the receptors or is counteracted by leptin resistance, despite 'normal' serum levels."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Rule of Three' in Polyautoimmunity (Lesson 3), what percentage of Hashimoto's patients are likely to develop a second or third autoimmune condition?",

                "Approximately 5%",
                "Between 14% and 25%",
                "Over 50%",
                "Less than 2%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that roughly 14-25% of individuals with one autoimmune disease (like Hashimoto's) will develop additional autoimmune conditions, such as Celiac or Vitiligo."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which mechanism explained in Lesson 4 describes how the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) can trigger an attack on the thyroid gland?",
            "options": [

                "Inhibition of the TSH receptor by viral DNA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses viral proteins with the body's own tissues (like Thyroid Peroxidase) due to structural similarities, leading to an autoimmune attack."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights that Mycotoxins (specifically Ochratoxin A) primarily interfere with thyroid function by:",

                "Lowering Reverse T3 levels too quickly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A and other mycotoxins induce oxidative stress that inhibits deiodinase activity, leading to reduced active T3 levels and increased Reverse T3."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "During the 'Thyrotoxic Phase' of Postpartum Thyroiditis (Lesson 6), what is the typical clinical recommendation regarding thyroid medication?",
            "options": [
                "Increase Levothyroxine dosage immediately",
                "Start Methimazole (anti-thyroid drugs) immediately",
                "Monitor and use Beta-blockers for symptoms, as it is usually self-limiting",
                "Permanent radioactive iodine ablation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The thyrotoxic phase of postpartum thyroiditis is caused by the release of stored hormone (leakage) rather than overproduction, so anti-thyroid drugs are usually ineffective; symptom management is preferred."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A client's labs show a Free T3 of 3.2 pg/mL and a Reverse T3 of 28 ng/dL. What is the calculated T3/rT3 ratio, and what does it suggest according to Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "Ratio of 11.4; suggests healthy tissue-level conversion",
                "Ratio of 8.7; suggests significant tissue-level hypothyroidism/sequestration",
                "Ratio of 32; suggests hyperthyroidism",
                "Ratio of 114; suggests iodine deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using the pg/mL to ng/dL conversion, a ratio below 20 (in this case, 11.4) is a strong indicator that the body is diverting T4 into rT3, signaling cellular-level hypothyroidism."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "In the Recovery Phase (Lesson 8), why is 'Pacing' critical for clients with a history of thyroid crisis?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM) and mitochondrial crashes",
                "To ensure they lose weight as quickly as possible",
                "To stimulate the production of more T4",
                "To increase cortisol levels to maximum capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pacing prevents the 'boom-bust' cycle where a client overexerts during a good window and suffers a multi-day relapse due to mitochondrial fragility."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Which specific heavy metal is noted in Lesson 5 for its ability to bind to selenium, thereby inactivating glutathione peroxidase and deiodinase enzymes?",

                "Aluminum",
                "Mercury",
                "Lead",
                "Arsenic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mercury has a high affinity for selenium. By sequestering selenium, it prevents the formation of enzymes necessary for thyroid hormone conversion and antioxidant protection."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A 'Non-Responder' client has improved their diet and labs, but still experiences extreme fatigue and 'brain fog.' Lesson 2 suggests investigating which 'hidden' metabolic block?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive Vitamin C intake",
                "Low stomach acid (Hypochlorhydria) affecting nutrient absorption",

                "Daily intake of cruciferous vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypochlorhydria is common in thyroid patients and prevents the absorption of key minerals like B12, Iron, and Zinc, which are essential for thyroid hormone utilization."
