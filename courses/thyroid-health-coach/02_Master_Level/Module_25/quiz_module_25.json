            "question": "According to the Proctor Model of Supervision used in Lesson 1, which function specifically focuses on the 'restorative' aspect of a thyroid coach's well-being and emotional processing?",
            "options": [
                "The Normative function",
                "The Formative function",
                "The Restorative (Supportive) function",
                "The Evaluative function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative function in the Proctor Model is dedicated to the coach's emotional support, helping them process the stress and 'compassion fatigue' often associated with managing chronic autoimmune cases."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2's discussion on Case Auditing, what is the recommended 'Audit-to-Action' threshold for identifying a systemic protocol failure rather than an individual client outlier?",
            "options": [
                "When 15% of clients fail to meet TPO antibody reduction targets within 6 months",
                "When 30% of clients fail to reach 'optimal' Free T3 levels despite protocol adherence",
                "When 50% of clients report no symptomatic improvement after 30 days",
                "When 5% of clients experience a flare-up during the reintroduction phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlights that if 30% or more of a cohort fails to reach objective lab markers like 'optimal' Free T3, the supervisor should audit the core protocol rather than individual coach performance."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "When mentoring a coach through a 'Refractory Hashimoto’s' case (Lesson 3), where the client is not responding to standard interventions, what does the 'Triad of Complexity' suggest investigating first?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the dosage of selenium and zinc",
                "Hidden co-infections, occult gut dysbiosis, or environmental toxicants",

                "The client's genetic predisposition to MTHFR mutations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Triad of Complexity' in complex autoimmune mentoring prioritizes systemic 'blockers' like co-infections (e.g., EBV), gut dysbiosis, and toxicants which prevent standard thyroid protocols from working."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A coach experiences 'Countertransference' (Lesson 4) when they become overly invested in a client's weight loss because it mirrors their own thyroid journey. What is the supervisor's primary role in this scenario?",
            "options": [
                "To tell the coach to stop sharing personal stories immediately",
                "To refer the client to a different coach to avoid bias",
                "To help the coach create 'Reflective Space' to separate their journey from the client's",
                "To encourage the coach to use their personal success as the primary protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supervision aims to create a 'Reflective Space' where the coach can recognize their emotional triggers (countertransference) and maintain professional boundaries without necessarily terminating the client relationship."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "During a lab interpretation mentoring session (Lesson 5), a coach presents a case with a 'Normal TSH' but a 'Low T3/Reverse T3 ratio' (< 10). What physiological state does this pattern typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism requiring medication increase",
                "Hyperthyroidism in its early stages",

                "Iodine toxicity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low T3/rT3 ratio (typically <10 or 15 depending on units) indicates that the body is sequestering thyroid hormone into the inactive Reverse T3 form, often due to systemic inflammation or chronic stress, regardless of a 'normal' TSH."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality is the recognition that one is not alone in their suffering. For thyroid patients who often feel 'crazy' or misunderstood, this is a primary benefit of group supervision and support."

            "id": "q25_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 2021 study cited in the lesson demonstrated that practitioners engaging in monthly clinical supervision showed a 42% lower rate of burnout compared to those practicing in isolation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 70-20-10 model states that 70% of learning comes from experience (on-the-job challenges), 20% from social learning (mentoring/supervision), and 10% from formal education."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "In a Peer Review session (Lesson 2), a coach is criticized for 'Protocol Rigidity.' What is the most effective way to mentor this coach toward 'Bio-Individual Agility'?",

                "Giving them a new, more complex protocol to follow",
                "Reviewing case studies where the 'standard' protocol failed and analyzing the variables",
                "Requiring the coach to take a test on thyroid biochemistry",
                "Restricting the coach to only 'easy' cases for three months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Analyzing 'failure' cases helps coaches understand that bio-individual variables (like genetics or lifestyle) necessitate protocol adjustments, moving them away from a one-size-fits-all approach."

            "id": "q25_10",
