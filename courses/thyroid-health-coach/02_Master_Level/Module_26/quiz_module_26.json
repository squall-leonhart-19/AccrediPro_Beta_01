            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ferritin levels below 70-90 ng/mL are often insufficient for optimal 5'-deiodinase activity, which is required for the conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prolonged restrictive diets can lead to nutrient gaps and a reduction in beneficial gut bacteria diversity; the goal is to find the broadest diet possible that maintains a low-symptom state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mobilizing toxins (detox) without ensuring the exit pathways (drainage) are functional can lead to 're-circulation' and acute symptom flares, often called a Herxheimer reaction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hybrid models allow coaches to serve more clients simultaneously, increasing profitability while the group dynamic often improves compliance and psychological outcomes for clients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High rT3 (typically >15-20) suggests the body is shunting T4 into an inactive form, often due to high cortisol, inflammation, or chronic stress, despite a 'normal' TSH."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BBT is a clinical indicator of metabolic rate; consistent temperatures below 97.8°F (36.5°C) often indicate that cellular metabolism and T3 utilization remain suboptimal."
