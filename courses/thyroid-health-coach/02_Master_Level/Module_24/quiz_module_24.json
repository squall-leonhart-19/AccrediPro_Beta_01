            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method™, the 'E' stands for 'Environmental & Epigenetic Integration.' At the L3 Master level, what is the primary focus of this pillar?",
            "options": [
                "Simply recommending a water filter and organic produce.",
                "Analyzing SNP-nutrient interactions and the affinity of specific toxicants for thyroid hormone receptors.",
                "Focusing exclusively on reducing plastic use in the kitchen.",
                "Providing a standard 7-day liver detox protocol for all thyroid clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 practitioners go beyond basic 'clean living' to analyze how genetic predispositions (SNPs) interact with specific environmental toxicants that act as endocrine disruptors at the receptor level."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of Psychoneuroendocrinology (PNE), how does chronic psychological stress specifically induce 'cellular hypothyroidism' despite normal serum TSH?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of TSH in the pituitary.",
                "By stimulating the overproduction of iodine in the thyroid gland.",
                "By upregulating Type 3 Deiodinase (D3), which converts T4 into metabolically inactive Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "By decreasing the sensitivity of the gut to thyroid hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol trigger the D3 enzyme, which shunts T4 away from active T3 and toward rT3, creating a state of cellular hypothyroidism that serum TSH often fails to capture."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cell Danger Response (CDR) is a metabolic state where mitochondria shift from energy production to cellular defense, often resulting in persistent fatigue despite 'normal' thyroid levels."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These environmental halogens and ions compete with iodine for entry into the thyroid via the NIS, which is a critical epigenetic/toxicological factor in thyroid dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) can bind to receptors on thyrocytes, stimulating cell proliferation and increasing the risk of nodule formation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting medication doses or advising a client to change their prescribed dosage is a direct violation of the scope of practice for a non-prescribing health coach."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The practitioner's presence serves as a regulatory tool for the client's HPA axis; co-regulation helps lower the stress response, which is foundational for thyroid recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen dominance increases the production of TBG in the liver. Since TBG binds thyroid hormones, more hormone is 'locked up' and less is available in the 'Free' (active) form."
