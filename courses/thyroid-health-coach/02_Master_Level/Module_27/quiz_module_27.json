            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "According to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for preconception and fertility, what is the optimal TSH target for women with positive TPO antibodies or a history of pregnancy loss?",
            "options": [
                "Under 4.5 mIU/L",
                "Under 2.5 mIU/L",
                "Between 3.0 and 5.0 mIU/L",
                "Exactly 1.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To optimize fertility and reduce the risk of early miscarriage, clinical guidelines recommend maintaining TSH below 2.5 mIU/L during the preconception period, especially in the presence of thyroid autoimmunity."

            "question": "A client in her first trimester of pregnancy has just been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Why is maternal T4 crucial during the first 18-20 weeks of gestation?",
            "options": [
                "The fetus cannot produce any of its own thyroid hormone until the second half of pregnancy.",
                "Maternal T4 is needed to suppress fetal TSH production.",
                "T4 is the only hormone that can cross the placenta; T3 cannot.",
                "Maternal T4 prevents the development of gestational diabetes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The fetal thyroid gland does not become fully functional until approximately 18-20 weeks of gestation. Before this point, the fetus is entirely dependent on the placental transfer of maternal thyroxine (T4) for neurodevelopment."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In pediatric and adolescent thyroid cases, what is often the most sensitive clinical indicator of undiagnosed juvenile hypothyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid weight gain in the extremities",
                "Excessive thirst and urination",

                "Advanced dental eruption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While adults present with metabolic slowing, children often show a 'growth plateau.' A decline in growth velocity or a height percentile drop on a growth chart is a hallmark sign of pediatric thyroid dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "During the perimenopause transition, how does 'estrogen dominance' (relative to low progesterone) typically impact thyroid physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), leading to thyrotoxicosis.",
                "It increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which lowers the amount of free, bioavailable thyroid hormone.",
                "It directly inhibits the pituitary gland from secreting TSH.",
                "It speeds up the conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of estrogen stimulate the liver to produce more Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). This protein binds to thyroid hormones, reducing the levels of 'Free' T4 and Free T3 available to the cells."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that for every 1 mIU/L increase in TSH within the 'normal' range, there was a measurable increase in what metabolic marker?",
            "options": [
                "HDL Cholesterol",
                "HOMA-IR (Insulin Resistance index)",

                "Bone Mineral Density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a strong correlation between higher-normal TSH levels and increased insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), suggesting that even mild thyroid slowing can impair glucose metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Following a total thyroidectomy, which laboratory value must be monitored alongside thyroid markers to ensure the parathyroid glands were not damaged?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Potassium",
                "Ionized Calcium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The parathyroid glands are located behind the thyroid and are responsible for calcium regulation. Accidental removal or trauma during surgery can lead to hypocalcemia, requiring calcium and Vitamin D supplementation."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In high-performance athletes, 'Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport' (RED-S) often presents with a specific thyroid lab pattern. What is it?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated TSH and Low Free T4",
                "Low TSH and High Free T3",
                "Normal/Low TSH with Low Free T3 and High Reverse T3",
                "Undetectable TSH and Undetectable T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In states of low energy availability, the body conserves energy by downregulating the conversion of T4 to active T3 and increasing Reverse T3. This 'Non-Thyroidal Illness' pattern is a physiological adaptation to overtraining or under-fueling."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "When working with geriatric clients (age 80+), why might a coach see a TSH of 6.5 mIU/L and not recommend aggressive medical intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Older adults have no receptors for thyroid hormone.",
                "Evidence suggests that slightly higher TSH in the very elderly is associated with increased longevity and reduced cardiovascular mortality.",
                "Thyroid medication is toxic to people over the age of 75.",
                "TSH is no longer an accurate marker once a person reaches age 70."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Observational studies in the 'Oldest Old' (80+) have shown that those with slightly elevated TSH (4.5-7.0 range) often have better survival outcomes than those with low TSH, suggesting the range shifts naturally with age."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Postpartum Thyroiditis (PPT) typically presents in a triphasic pattern. In what order do these phases usually occur?",

                "Hypothyroid -> Thyrotoxic -> Euthyroid",
                "Thyrotoxic -> Hypothyroid -> Euthyroid (Recovery)",

                "Hypothyroid -> Euthyroid -> Thyrotoxic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PPT usually begins with a thyrotoxic phase (1-4 months postpartum) due to the release of stored hormone from an inflamed gland, followed by a hypothyroid phase (4-8 months postpartum) before eventual recovery."

            "id": "q27_10",

            "options": [
                "Iron",
                "Selenium",
                "Calcium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for the glutathione peroxidase system, which protects thyroid cells from oxidative damage. This is particularly important when the gland has been stressed by radiation or autoimmune attack."
