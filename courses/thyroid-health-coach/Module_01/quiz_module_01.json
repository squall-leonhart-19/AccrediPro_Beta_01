            "question": "According to Lesson 1, why is TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) considered an indirect marker of thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "It is produced by the thyroid gland itself to regulate metabolism.",
                "It is a pituitary hormone that reflects the brain's perception of circulating T4, not necessarily cellular T3 levels.",
                "It measures the total amount of iodine available for hormone synthesis.",
                "It is the only hormone that accurately reflects the metabolic rate of peripheral tissues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TSH is produced by the anterior pituitary. While it is the standard screening tool, it reflects the pituitary's response to circulating T4 and does not account for peripheral conversion issues or cellular resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In a comprehensive thyroid panel, what is the primary clinical significance of measuring Free T3 rather than Total T3?",
            "options": [
                "Total T3 is more stable and less affected by protein binding.",
                "Free T3 represents the unbound, biologically active hormone available to enter cells and bind to receptors.",
                "Free T3 is the primary hormone produced by the thyroid gland (approx. 80%).",
                "Total T3 is the only marker required to diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Free T3 is the active form of the hormone. Total T3 includes hormones bound to transport proteins (like TBG), which are not immediately available for cellular use."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'normal' TSH of 2.1 mIU/L but exhibits classic hypothyroid symptoms. If their Free T3 is at the bottom of the reference range and Reverse T3 is high, what is the most likely physiological mechanism at play?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism (Thyroid failure)",
                "Iodine deficiency leading to goiter",
                "The 'Metabolic Brake'—excessive conversion of T4 into rT3 instead of Free T3",
                "Pituitary exhaustion (Secondary Hypothyroidism)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High Reverse T3 (rT3) acts as a metabolic brake, competing with Free T3 for receptor sites. This often occurs during chronic stress, inflammation, or calorie restriction, even when TSH appears normal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights that approximately what percentage of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the liver?",
            "options": [
                "20%",
                "40%",
                "60%",
                "95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liver is the primary site for peripheral deiodination, accounting for approximately 60% of the conversion of T4 into the active T3 hormone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which specific enzyme is responsible for the conversion of T4 into the active Free T3, and which nutrient is its essential co-factor?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase; Magnesium",
                "5'-deiodinase; Selenium",
                "Aromatase; Zinc",
                "Protease; Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5'-deiodinase enzymes (D1 and D2) are selenoproteins, meaning they require selenium to function and convert T4 into active T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 6, what does the presence of TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase) antibodies indicate, even if TSH and T4 are within the standard reference range?",
            "options": [
                "The client has a 100% chance of developing Graves' Disease within one year.",
                "Active autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue (Silent Autoimmunity), which may precede TSH elevation by years.",
                "The client is consuming too much dietary iodine.",
                "The thyroid is over-producing hormone to compensate for liver dysfunction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TPO antibodies are markers of Hashimoto's. Their presence indicates an immune attack on the thyroid, which often manifests as 'Silent Autoimmunity' before clinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH) is diagnosed."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "According to the Functional Synthesis (Lesson 8), what is the 'Optimal' functional range for TSH for most healthy adults, as opposed to the broad standard lab range?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 mIU/L",
                "0.5 - 2.0 mIU/L",
                "2.5 - 5.5 mIU/L",
                "4.0 - 10.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs use a broad range (often up to 4.5 or 5.0), functional medicine practitioners typically look for TSH between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L for optimal metabolic function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 1 found that what percentage of patients on T4-only medication (Levothyroxine) continue to experience symptoms despite having 'normal' TSH levels?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Approximately 5-8%",
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Over 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Saravanan et al.) indicate that roughly 10-15% of patients on T4-monotherapy do not achieve symptomatic relief because TSH normalization does not guarantee cellular T3 adequacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which nutrient deficiency is most likely to impair the *binding* of T3 to its nuclear receptor, effectively causing 'thyroid resistance' despite adequate hormone levels?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin A",
                "Calcium",
                "Copper",
                "Vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin A and Zinc are critical for the health of the thyroid hormone receptors. Vitamin A, specifically, is required for the T3 receptor to bind to the DNA (via the RXR receptor)."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (Age 38) has TSH 1.8, FT4 1.2 (Range 0.8-1.8), FT3 2.2 (Range 2.3-4.2), and Ferritin 15 ng/mL. What is the most appropriate functional interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Sarah is hyperthyroid and needs methimazole.",
                "Sarah's thyroid is fine because TSH is 1.8; her symptoms are likely psychological.",
                "Sarah has a conversion issue likely exacerbated by low iron (Ferritin), which is required for TPO activity and deiodinase function.",
                "Sarah has Hashimoto's because her FT4 is in the upper half of the range."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah shows low FT3 despite a good TSH and FT4. Her low Ferritin (optimal is 70-100 ng/mL) is a significant bottleneck for both thyroid hormone production and peripheral conversion."
