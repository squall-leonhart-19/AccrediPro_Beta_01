            "question": "Which mechanism best explains why Mercury (Hg) is particularly damaging to thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "It directly dissolves the thyroid follicle walls upon contact.",
                "It has a high affinity for selenium, sequestering the cofactor required for Deiodinase enzymes.",
                "It mimics Sodium, causing the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) to malfunction.",
                "It increases the half-life of TSH, leading to thyroid exhaustion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mercury binds strongly to selenium-dependent enzymes (selenoproteins). Since Deiodinase enzymes (D1, D2) require selenium to convert T4 to T3, mercury exposure effectively 'steals' the selenium, leading to low T3 levels even if T4 is sufficient."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, which mycotoxin was specifically noted for its ability to suppress TSH production and damage the HPT axis feedback loop?",
            "options": [
                "Aflatoxin",
                "Fumonisins",
                "Ochratoxin A",
                "Ergot Alkaloids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is known to interfere with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, often resulting in suppressed TSH levels that mask an underlying hypothyroid state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to Dr. Robert Naviaux’s Cell Danger Response (CDR) theory, what is the primary metabolic shift that occurs during chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondria increase ATP production to fuel the immune system.",
                "Mitochondria shift from energy production to cellular defense, hardening the cell membrane.",
                "The cell increases T4 to T3 conversion to speed up repair mechanisms.",
                "The cell enters a state of hyper-metabolism to burn off toxins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In CDR, mitochondria stop prioritizing oxidative phosphorylation (energy) and instead focus on cellular defense, which involves stiffening the cell membrane and signaling danger to neighboring cells."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 4 indicates that individuals with an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) score of 4 or higher have what increased risk of developing an autoimmune disease?",
            "options": [
                "20-30% increase",
                "45-55% increase",
                "70-100% increase",
                "They have no increased risk, only psychological symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows a strong correlation between early life trauma and adult-onset autoimmunity, with an ACE score of 4+ increasing the risk of hospitalizations for autoimmune conditions by 70% to 100%."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Why is the 'Glymphatic System' critical for thyroid patients, particularly during Lesson 5's discussion on sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "It is the system that converts T4 to T3 in the brain.",
                "It is the waste-clearance system of the CNS that functions primarily during deep sleep to remove metabolic debris.",
                "It is a lymphatic branch in the neck that drains the thyroid gland specifically.",
                "It regulates the uptake of iodine in the thyroid follicle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system clears neurotoxic waste, including beta-amyloid, from the brain during deep (Slow Wave) sleep. Poor sleep architecture prevents this 'brain washing,' leading to neuro-inflammation and HPA axis dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the liver?",

                "40%",
                "60%",
                "90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liver is the primary site for peripheral T4 to T3 conversion, accounting for roughly 60% of the active T3 produced in the body."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Normal' TSH and T4, but 'Low' T3 and 'High' Reverse T3 (rT3). Based on Lesson 8, which state is their nervous system likely stuck in?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",

                "Hyper-metabolic State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High Reverse T3 is a hallmark of the body attempting to slow down metabolism during chronic stress (Sympathetic dominance or CDR) to conserve energy and protect the organism."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Which 'Hidden Stressor' discussed in Lesson 6 is linked to the disruption of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs), potentially impacting thyroid signaling?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive dietary fiber",
                "Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs)",
                "Vitamin D supplementation",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-ionizing radiation from EMFs can trigger the opening of VGCCs, leading to an influx of calcium into the cell, which promotes oxidative stress and interferes with mitochondrial function."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "In the context of Liver and Gallbladder support (Lesson 7), why is bile flow essential for 'Phase R' resolution?",
            "options": [
                "Bile is the primary carrier for excreting fat-soluble toxins and metabolized hormones.",
                "Bile converts T3 back into T4 for storage.",
                "Bile neutralizes stomach acid to protect the thyroid.",
                "Bile increases the absorption of synthetic thyroid medication by 500%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bile acts as a 'detergent' and a transport vehicle. Without adequate bile flow (cholestasis), toxins like mycotoxins and heavy metals are reabsorbed in the gut (enterohepatic circulation) rather than excreted."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Nervous System Regulation' protocol for metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "To force the thyroid to produce more T4.",
                "To increase Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and signal safety to the mitochondria.",
                "To eliminate the need for thyroid hormone replacement therapy.",
                "To suppress the immune system so it stops attacking the thyroid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By increasing HRV and moving the client into a Ventral Vagal state, we signal 'safety' to the cells, which encourages the mitochondria to exit the Cell Danger Response and resume normal energy production and hormone conversion."
