            "question": "According to Lesson 1, why is 'niching down' specifically into a sub-category like 'Hashimoto’s for Postpartum Moms' more effective than general thyroid coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge lower prices to attract more people.",
                "It reduces the marketing noise and positions you as a specialist rather than a generalist.",
                "It requires less scientific knowledge of the thyroid system.",
                "General thyroid coaching is legally prohibited in most states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates perceived expertise. By solving a specific problem for a specific group, your marketing becomes 'magnetic' to those individuals, allowing for higher conversion rates and premium pricing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 2's high-ticket offers, what is the primary reason for moving away from 'per-session' billing?",
            "options": [
                "Per-session billing is more profitable for the coach in the long run.",
                "Clients prefer paying small amounts frequently.",
                "It tethers your value to time rather than the transformation and outcome.",
                "Insurance companies only reimburse for package deals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket coaching focuses on the 'Result' (e.g., energy restoration). Hourly billing encourages clients to skip sessions to save money, which undermines their clinical outcomes and your business stability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Authority Marketing. What is the 'Expertise Gap' and how should a coach use it?",
            "options": [
                "The gap between what a doctor says and what the client feels; the coach fills it with empathy.",
                "The gap between complex lab data and client understanding; the coach translates this into actionable steps.",
                "The distance between a coach’s certification and a medical degree.",
                "The difference in price between a health coach and a nutritionist."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authority is built by demonstrating that you understand the nuances of the condition (like the T3/T4 conversion process) better than the client, and can translate that complexity into a simple plan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "In a thyroid-specific marketing funnel (Lesson 4), which 'Lead Magnet' typically sees the highest conversion rate for thyroid prospects?",
            "options": [
                "A 100-page ebook on the history of endocrinology.",
                "A generic 'Eat Better' grocery list.",
                "A 'Thyroid Symptom & Lab Marker Checklist' or 'AIP Quick-Start Guide'.",
                "A 10% discount coupon for a coaching session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid clients are often overwhelmed. Specific, high-utility tools like symptom checklists or specific dietary protocols (AIP) solve an immediate problem and demonstrate your niche expertise."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_5",
            "question": "During an ethical sales call (Lesson 5), if a client says 'I need to think about it,' what is the recommended professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Offer a 50% discount if they sign up right now.",
                "End the call immediately to respect their privacy.",
                "Ask 'What specifically do you need to think about?' to uncover hidden fears or objections.",
                "Tell them the offer is expiring in 10 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical sales involves coaching the client through their indecision. Often, 'thinking about it' is a mask for fear of failure; addressing the root concern helps the client make a committed decision for their health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, which professional is considered the 'Gold Standard' for a strategic referral partnership for a Thyroid Coach?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional and Integrative MDs often lack the time to provide the intensive lifestyle and dietary support thyroid patients need. This creates a symbiotic relationship where they handle the medical side and you handle the implementation."

            "id": "q31_7",
            "question": "When scaling with Paid Traffic (Lesson 7), what does a 'Return on Ad Spend' (ROAS) of 3x signify?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ROAS is a financial metric. A 3x ROAS means your advertising is profitable, generating $3 for every $1 invested, which is a key indicator that your practice is ready to scale."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Retention is about increasing Lifetime Value (LTV). Once the initial 'crisis' is solved in an intensive program, clients often need ongoing, lower-touch support to maintain their results."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 4 showed that a 'Thyroid Masterclass' webinar yielded a 12% booking rate. What was the primary 'Call to Action' (CTA) used?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high-ticket offers ($2,000+), the goal of top-of-funnel marketing (like a webinar) is almost always to get a qualified lead onto a phone call to discuss individual needs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q31_10",
            "question": "What is 'The Cost of Inaction' strategy used in enrollment conversations?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients often focus on the price of the program. By highlighting the 'Cost of Inaction' (continued fatigue, weight gain, lost time with family), the coach helps the client see the value of the solution."
