            "question": "In the 'Non-Responder' case study (L1), a client maintains high TPO antibodies despite a strict AIP diet and normal TSH. Which underlying factor is most likely responsible for this persistent immune activation?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient caloric intake causing metabolic stress",
                "Molecular mimicry from occult infections like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) or Yersinia",
                "Excessive intake of cruciferous vegetables (goitrogens)",
                "A deficiency in Vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When dietary interventions fail to lower antibodies, practitioners must look for 'stealth' triggers such as chronic viral loads (EBV) or gut pathogens (Yersinia) that drive immune activity through molecular mimicry."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A post-thyroidectomy client (L2) feels symptomatic on T4-only medication despite 'optimal' TSH levels. According to the lesson, what physiological reality is often overlooked in these cases?",
            "options": [
                "The healthy thyroid gland naturally produces approximately 20% of the body's daily T3 directly.",
                "T4-only medication is toxic to the liver in the absence of a thyroid gland.",
                "TSH is the only valid marker for tissue-level thyroid status post-surgery.",
                "The body loses the ability to produce TBG after a thyroidectomy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The human thyroid gland produces about 20% of circulating T3. Without the gland, T4-only therapy relies entirely on peripheral conversion, which is often insufficient for many patients, necessitating T3/T4 combination therapy."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, how does Estrogen Dominance during perimenopause specifically impact thyroid hormone bioavailability?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the thyroid to overproduce T4",
                "It decreases the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)",
                "It increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which 'traps' free hormones, making them unavailable to cells",
                "It directly destroys T3 molecules in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High estrogen levels stimulate the liver to produce more Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). TBG binds to thyroid hormones; when TBG is high, the levels of 'Free' (bioavailable) T4 and T3 drop, even if total levels look normal."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to the Gut-Thyroid connection (L4), what percentage of T4 to T3 conversion is estimated to occur in a healthy GI tract via the enzyme thyroid sulfatase?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Less than 1%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It is estimated that roughly 20% of T4 is converted to T3 in the gut by beneficial bacteria. Conditions like SIBO or dysbiosis can significantly impair this process."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the 'Toxic Burden' case study (L5), which specific mycotoxin is highlighted for its ability to cause oxidative damage to thyroid follicular cells and interfere with iodine transport?",
            "options": [
                "Aflatoxin",
                "Ochratoxin A",
                "Botulinum toxin",
                "Ergotamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A, commonly found in water-damaged buildings, has been shown in clinical literature to be particularly nephrotoxic and damaging to thyroid follicular cells, contributing to Hashimoto's flares."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A weight loss 'stall' in a thyroid client (L6) is often due to Metabolic Adaptation. Which hormonal shift is a hallmark of this adaptation during prolonged caloric restriction?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Free T3 and decrease in rT3",
                "A decrease in Leptin and a subsequent increase in Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "A surge in TSH to above 10.0 mIU/L",
                "The complete cessation of T4 production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During metabolic adaptation, Leptin levels drop, signaling the hypothalamus to slow metabolism. This leads to a decrease in active T3 and an increase in Reverse T3 (rT3) to conserve energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 (HPA Axis), how does chronic 'High Cortisol' stage adrenal dysfunction typically affect the thyroid panel?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid receptors",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, shifting conversion from Free T3 to Reverse T3",
                "It causes a false low TSH reading below 0.01",
                "It has no measurable effect on thyroid labs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, instead shunting T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3) form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Using the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method (L8), if a client presents with both SIBO and severe HPA axis dysfunction, which is generally addressed first to ensure the client can tolerate further treatment?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive antimicrobial herbs for SIBO",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Adrenal support and nervous system regulation",
                "Immediate increase in T3 medication dosage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. method, the 'A' (Adrenals/Nervous System) often takes priority because a client in a 'sympathetic dominant' state will not heal their 'B' (Biome/Gut) effectively and may react poorly to antimicrobials."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A case study client has a TSH of 2.1, but a Ferritin level of 12 ng/mL. Why is this Ferritin level a 'red flag' for thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "Ferritin is required for the enzyme Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) to function properly.",
                "Low Ferritin causes the thyroid to grow in size (Goiter).",
                "Ferritin is the primary transport protein for T3.",
                "There is no link between Ferritin and thyroid function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) is a heme-dependent enzyme. Without adequate iron (stored as Ferritin), TPO cannot efficiently utilize iodine to create thyroid hormones, often causing hypothyroid symptoms despite normal TSH."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to the data presented in Module 16, what is the 'Optimal' range for the Free T3 / Reverse T3 ratio to indicate healthy tissue-level conversion?",
            "options": [
                "Lower than 2",
                "Exactly 10",
                "Greater than 20 (when using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3)",
                "The ratio does not matter as long as TSH is normal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Free T3 / Reverse T3 ratio (using the specific units pg/mL and ng/dL) of greater than 20 is generally considered optimal, indicating that the body is successfully converting T4 into active T3 rather than inactive rT3."
