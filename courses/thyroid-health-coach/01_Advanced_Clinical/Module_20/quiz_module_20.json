            "question": "When analyzing a thyroid panel, what does a Free T3 / Reverse T3 ratio of less than 20 (using pg/mL for FT3) typically indicate in a clinical setting?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal peripheral conversion of T4 to T3",
                "Excessive cellular uptake of thyroid hormone",
                "Suboptimal T4 to T3 conversion or 'Cellular Hypothyroidism'",
                "Primary hyperthyroidism requiring immediate referral"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Free T3/rT3 ratio below 20 (pg/mL) or 10 (ng/dL) suggests that the body is shunting T4 into the inactive rT3 form rather than active T3, often due to systemic inflammation, high cortisol, or nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of Hashimoto’s patients are estimated to be 'seronegative,' meaning they lack detectable TPO or Tg antibodies in serum despite having the disease?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "5% to 15%",
                "25% to 30%",
                "Over 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 5-15% of patients with biopsy-confirmed Hashimoto's thyroiditis do not present with elevated serum antibodies, necessitating the use of ultrasound for a definitive diagnosis."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "On a DUTCH test, a client presents with high 'Metabolized Cortisol' but low '24-hour Free Cortisol.' What is the most likely physiological interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client has Addison's Disease",
                "The client is clearing cortisol rapidly, potentially due to hyperthyroidism or obesity",
                "The client's HPA-axis is completely shut down",
                "The client is supplementing with excessive exogenous hydrocortisone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High metabolized cortisol with low free cortisol indicates that the adrenal glands are producing plenty of cortisol, but the body is processing and clearing it very quickly, a common finding in hyperthyroid states or metabolic syndrome."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Why is intracellular (RBC) testing for Magnesium and Zinc considered superior to standard serum testing for thyroid health coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Serum levels only represent 1% of total body stores and are tightly regulated",
                "Serum levels are affected by recent meals, whereas RBC levels are not",
                "RBC testing measures the last 120 days of nutrient status",
                "All of the above"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Serum minerals represent a tiny fraction of body stores and are homeostatically controlled. RBC testing provides a more accurate reflection of long-term (120-day) status and cellular availability."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, which halogen is identified as a significant environmental toxin that competitively inhibits iodine uptake via the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Bromide",
                "Potassium",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bromide, along with Fluoride and Chloride, are halogens that can displace Iodine in the thyroid gland due to their similar atomic structure, leading to reduced thyroid hormone synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Which marker on a comprehensive stool analysis is most indicative of 'Leaky Gut' (intestinal permeability) which can trigger molecular mimicry in Hashimoto's?",
            "options": [
                "Steatocrit",
                "Zonulin",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Secretory IgA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the wall of the digestive tract; elevated levels are a hallmark of intestinal permeability."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client's Organic Acids Test (OAT) shows significantly elevated Succinate and Citrate. This pattern most likely points to dysfunction in which area?",
            "options": [
                "Phase II Liver Detoxification",
                "The Krebs Cycle (Mitochondrial energy production)",
                "Dopamine metabolism",
                "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated Krebs Cycle intermediates like Succinate, Citrate, or Malate suggest 'bottlenecks' in mitochondrial energy production, which directly impacts the ATP-dependent conversion of T4 to T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Assessment Matrix, what does the 'A' stand for, and why is it critical for thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "Anemia; because iron is needed for TPO activity",
                "Autonomic Nervous System; because sympathetic dominance inhibits T4 to T3 conversion",
                "Antibodies; because they confirm the presence of autoimmunity",
                "Age; because thyroid requirements change with senescence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' stands for Autonomic Nervous System. Chronic sympathetic dominance (fight or flight) increases rT3 and suppresses the HPT axis, making autonomic balance crucial for thyroid recovery."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH (2.1 uIU/mL) but has cold extremities, thinning hair, and constipation. Which advanced assessment tool would be most helpful to find the 'hidden' dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "A repeat TSH test in 6 months",
                "A standard lipid panel",
                "A full thyroid panel including Free T3, Free T4, and Reverse T3",
                "A fasting glucose test"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TSH alone is insufficient; a full panel is required to see if the client is struggling with peripheral conversion (low FT3) or high rT3, which explains symptoms despite a normal TSH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "According to the module, elevated levels of Beta-glucuronidase in the gut can interfere with thyroid health by:",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing the absorption of Selenium",
                "Deconjugating estrogen, leading to estrogen dominance which increases TBG",
                "Directly attacking the thyroid gland via molecular mimicry",
                "Increasing the production of TSH in the pituitary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Beta-glucuronidase allows 'packaged' estrogen to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Excess estrogen increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which lowers the amount of Free (active) thyroid hormone available to cells."
