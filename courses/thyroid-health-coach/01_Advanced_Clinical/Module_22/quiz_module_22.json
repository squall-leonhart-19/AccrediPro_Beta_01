                "Telling the client their doctor is wrong for not prescribing medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches do not diagnose. They can educate on functional ranges and provide the client with questions to take to their primary care physician or endocrinologist."

                "Requiring the client to stop all medications before testing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical interpretation of baseline testing requires a clear boundary: the coach uses data to identify patterns and educational opportunities, ensuring the client knows this does not replace medical advice."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto’s expresses a desire to stop their Levothyroxine because they 'feel better' after three weeks of coaching. What is the coach's ethical obligation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Deprescribing Dilemma' lesson emphasizes that coaches have zero authority over prescription medication. Tapering or stopping meds without MD supervision is a major liability and safety risk."

                "A requirement that the client purchases the supplements through the coach's affiliate link."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires disclosing potential risks and benefits. High-dose iodine, for example, can trigger a 'Wolff-Chaikoff' effect or exacerbate Hashimoto's in some individuals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing distinguishes between 'cures' (which are not supported for autoimmune conditions) and 'remission' or 'support,' which focus on symptom management and antibody reduction."

            "explanation": "Confidentiality is a cornerstone of professional integrity. Using encrypted, secure storage is essential for protecting sensitive health information (PHI)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red flags like physical neck changes, tremors, or tachycardia require an immediate referral to a medical professional, as these could indicate serious pathology beyond the scope of coaching."

            "question": "A 2022 survey found that 68% of thyroid patients feel 'dismissed' by their conventional doctors. Ethically, how should a coach use this statistic?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical coaches use the common 'gap' in conventional care to provide empathy and advocacy training, helping the client receive better care from their physician rather than creating a divide."
