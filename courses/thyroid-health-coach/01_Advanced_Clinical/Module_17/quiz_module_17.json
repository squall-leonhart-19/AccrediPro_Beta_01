            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client presents with 'stuck' progress despite 'normal' TSH and Free T4 levels. According to Lesson 1, which subclinical obstacle is most likely responsible for impaired cellular T3 signaling without altering pituitary output?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "High levels of Reverse T3 (rT3) due to systemic inflammation",
                "Iodine deficiency leading to goiter",
                "Pituitary adenoma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammation can trigger the deiodinase type 3 (D3) enzyme, converting T4 into Reverse T3 instead of Free T3, effectively blocking the T3 receptor site without necessarily triggering a TSH response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Thyroid-Gut Axis' highlights that SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) is prevalent in what percentage of hypothyroid patients according to cited clinical data?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "Up to 54%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that up to 54% of hypothyroid patients may suffer from SIBO, which significantly impairs the absorption of thyroid replacement medication and essential minerals like selenium and zinc."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "How does Estrogen Dominance, common in perimenopause, directly impact thyroid hormone bioavailability?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases the production of TSH in the pituitary",
                "It increases Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which 'traps' free hormones",
                "It stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4",
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Excess estrogen stimulates the liver to produce higher levels of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). High TBG levels bind more thyroid hormone, reducing the 'Free' fraction available for cellular use."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client with chronic mold exposure (mycotoxins) often shows 'Metabolic Rigidity.' According to Lesson 4, which mycotoxin is specifically noted for disrupting the HPT axis and inhibiting TPO activity?",

                "Ochratoxin A",
                "Gliotoxin",
                "Chaetoglobosin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) has been shown in clinical studies to exert nephrotoxic and endocrine-disrupting effects, specifically interfering with thyroid peroxidase (TPO) function and iodine uptake."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "The concept of 'Molecular Mimicry' in Lesson 5 explains how the immune system confuses thyroid tissue with which pathogen due to protein sequence similarities?",
            "options": [
                "Candida Albicans",

                "Influenza A"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBV proteins (specifically EBNA-1) share structural similarities with thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin. This 'molecular mimicry' can cause the immune system to attack the thyroid after an EBV reactivation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, how does hyperinsulinemia (Insulin Resistance) affect the deiodination process?",
            "options": [
                "It increases D1 activity, causing hyperthyroidism",
                "It has no effect on thyroid hormones",
                "It impairs D1 and D2 activity, reducing the conversion of T4 to active T3",
                "It increases the sensitivity of T3 receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin resistance and high levels of circulating insulin are associated with decreased activity of the deiodinase enzymes (D1 and D2), which are responsible for converting T4 into the metabolically active T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, what is the 'Functional' optimal range for Ferritin required to ensure adequate T3 utilization at the cellular receptor level?",

                "Over 300 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges for ferritin can be as low as 12 ng/mL, functional thyroid health requires ferritin levels between 70-100 ng/mL to support T3 receptor binding and mitochondrial function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client presents with high Ferritin but low Serum Iron and low TIBC. Based on Lesson 7, what is the likely clinical scenario?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD), the body sequestrates iron in ferritin to keep it away from perceived pathogens/inflammation, resulting in high ferritin but low circulating iron available for thyroid function."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "The 'B' in the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Clinical Roadmap (Lesson 8) stands for 'Biochemical Foundations.' Which of the following is a primary focus of this stage?",

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When managing a client with suspected 'Metabolic Rigidity,' which strategy is recommended in Lesson 8 to restore HPT axis sensitivity?",
            "options": [

                "Restricting calories to under 1,000 per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restoring metabolic flexibility requires stabilizing the blood sugar response and aligning the circadian rhythm to reduce nocturnal cortisol spikes, which otherwise inhibit TSH and T4-to-T3 conversion."
