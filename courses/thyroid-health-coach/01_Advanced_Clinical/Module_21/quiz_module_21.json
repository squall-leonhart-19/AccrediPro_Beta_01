            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Workflow, why is addressing 'Gut Integrity' and 'Inflammation' prioritized before attempting a 'Metabolic Rebound' or heavy caloric increase?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client loses weight as quickly as possible.",
                "To reduce systemic inflammation and ensure nutrient co-factors are properly absorbed for T4 to T3 conversion.",
                "Because thyroid hormones are primarily produced in the large intestine.",
                "To intentionally lower TSH levels below the functional range."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the gut and inflammation first reduces the 'cellular danger response' and ensures the body can actually utilize the nutrients and hormones required for metabolic up-regulation."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "When interpreting advanced baseline data, a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (fT3/rT3) is a critical marker. Which ratio (using pg/mL for fT3 and ng/dL for rT3) typically indicates optimal cellular thyroid sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "A ratio of less than 10",
                "A ratio of exactly 1:1",
                "A ratio of 20 or higher",
                "A ratio of 5 or lower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ratio of 20 or higher (e.g., fT3 of 3.2 pg/mL and rT3 of 12 ng/dL = 26.6) suggests that the body is efficiently converting T4 to active T3 rather than shunting it into the inactive rT3 form."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Hashimoto’s Remission Roadmap,' what is the primary clinical goal regarding Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) antibodies within the first 6 months of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Total eradication (0 IU/mL) in all clients.",
                "A reduction of at least 50% or a trend toward the 'low-risk' functional range (<30 IU/mL).",
                "An increase in antibodies to stimulate the immune system.",
                "Maintaining antibodies at current levels while increasing T4 dosage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While total eradication is ideal, a 50% reduction or a consistent downward trend indicates that the triggers (dietary, environmental, or infectious) are being successfully managed."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "For a client identified with the 'High-Cortisol/Stressed' phenotype, which nutritional strategy is most effective for HPT axis stabilization?",
            "options": [
                "Strict Ketogenic dieting with less than 20g of carbs daily.",
                "Intermittent fasting for 20+ hours daily.",
                "Moderate carbohydrate intake with a focus on complex carbohydrates during the evening meal.",
                "A high-protein, zero-carb carnivore protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic evening carbohydrates can help lower evening cortisol levels and support the conversion of T4 to T3, which is often inhibited by chronic stress and high cortisol."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "The Nordio et al. (2013) study highlighted in Lesson 5 demonstrated that which supplement combination was more effective at reducing TSH and TPO-Ab than Selenium alone?",
            "options": [
                "Selenium and Vitamin D3",
                "Selenium and Myo-inositol",
                "Selenium and Magnesium Glycinate",
                "Selenium and Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of Selenium and Myo-inositol has shown superior results in clinical trials for restoring euthyroidism and reducing thyroid autoantibodies compared to Selenium monotherapy."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In the context of Environmental Toxin Mitigation, how do halogens like Fluoride and Bromide specifically interfere with thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the rate of T3 breakdown in the liver.",
                "They act as competitive inhibitors for iodine at the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS).",
                "They stimulate the pituitary to overproduce TSH.",
                "They bind to Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG) and prevent hormone transport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluoride and Bromide sit in the same column of the periodic table as Iodine; they can 'displace' iodine in the thyroid gland, leading to reduced hormone production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Non-Thyroidal Illness Syndrome' (Euthyroid Sick Syndrome) due to extreme overtraining. What lab pattern would you expect to see?",
            "options": [
                "High TSH, High fT4, Low rT3",
                "Low/Normal TSH, Low fT3, and significantly Elevated Reverse T3",
                "Low TSH, High fT4, High fT3",
                "High TSH, Low fT4, Low fT3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In states of physiological stress or overtraining, the body preserves energy by downregulating the HPT axis and increasing the conversion of T4 into inactive Reverse T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "During the 'Metabolic Rebound' phase (L8), increasing the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) is recommended. How is this practically achieved?",
            "options": [
                "By consuming only raw vegetables.",
                "By increasing protein intake to 25-30% of total daily calories.",
                "By reducing total caloric intake to under 1,000 kcal.",
                "By drinking 4 liters of ice-cold water daily."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protein has the highest TEF (20-30%), meaning the body burns more energy processing it, which helps 're-fire' a sluggish metabolism during recovery."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Jane has Hashimoto's, TPO-Ab of 800, and is currently doing '75 Hard' (intense exercise twice daily) while on a 1,200 calorie diet. Her fT3 is low-range. What is the priority intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Add a T3-only medication immediately.",
                "Switch to a juice cleanse to 'detox' the thyroid.",
                "Implement a 'Recovery Phase': reduce exercise to walking/yoga and increase calories to maintenance levels.",
                "Increase the intensity of the morning workout to boost adrenaline."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Jane is in a state of metabolic adaptation and high physiological stress. Adding more stress (exercise/restriction) will worsen her thyroid status. Recovery is the priority."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Lesson 6 identifies 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals' (EDCs). Which practical step is most effective for reducing a client's daily exposure to Phthalates and BPA?",
            "options": [
                "Switching from plastic to glass or stainless steel food storage and avoiding thermal paper receipts.",
                "Taking a daily laxative to clear the bowels.",
                "Eating more farm-raised fish.",
                "Using conventional 'scented' laundry detergents and candles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and BPA are primarily found in plastics and thermal coatings. Switching containers and avoiding handling receipts are high-impact, low-cost interventions."
