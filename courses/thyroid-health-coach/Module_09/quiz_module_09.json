            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Advanced Interpretation,' what is the primary limitation of relying solely on TSH to assess thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "TSH is only produced in the thyroid gland itself.",
                "TSH reflects pituitary sensitivity to circulating hormones but may not reflect cellular thyroid status.",
                "TSH levels are unaffected by stress or systemic inflammation.",
                "TSH has a very long half-life of over 14 days, making it unresponsive to changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TSH is a pituitary hormone. While it signals the thyroid, it reflects the pituitary's perception of hormone levels, which can be skewed by systemic factors, whereas Free T3 and Free T4 provide a better picture of available hormone for the cells."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, which enzyme is upregulated during 'Metabolic Braking,' leading to the increased production of Reverse T3 (rT3)?",
            "options": [
                "Type 1 Deiodinase (D1)",
                "Type 2 Deiodinase (D2)",
                "Type 3 Deiodinase (D3)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Type 3 Deiodinase (D3) is the 'inactivating' enzyme. During stress, illness, or starvation, the body upregulates D3 to convert T4 into rT3 (an inactive isomer) and T3 into T2, effectively slowing the metabolic rate."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the 'Five Stages of Hashimoto’s Autoimmunity' (Lesson 3), what characterizes Stage 2 (Silent Thyroiditis)?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated TSH and low Free T4.",
                "Normal TSH, Normal T4/T3, but elevated thyroid antibodies (TPO or TgAb).",
                "Complete destruction of the thyroid gland with no detectable antibodies.",
                "Overt symptoms of myxedema and metabolic failure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage 2 is the 'silent' stage where the immune system has begun attacking the thyroid (evidenced by antibodies), but the gland is still compensated enough to maintain normal TSH and T4 levels."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Molecular Mimicry.' Which dietary protein is most frequently cited for its structural similarity to thyroid tissue, potentially triggering cross-reactivity?",
            "options": [
                "Casein in A2 milk",
                "Alpha-gliadin in gluten",
                "Zein in corn",
                "Ovalbumin in egg whites"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha-gliadin (a component of gluten) shares structural similarities with thyroid peroxidase (TPO). In susceptible individuals, the immune system may confuse thyroid tissue for gluten, a process known as molecular mimicry."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Regarding the 'Gut-Thyroid Axis' (Lesson 5), how do Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate support thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "By directly synthesizing T4 in the intestinal lumen.",
                "By increasing the expression of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG).",
                "By promoting T-regulatory (Treg) cell function and reducing systemic inflammation.",
                "By inhibiting the absorption of iodine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SCFAs produced by a healthy microbiome help maintain the intestinal barrier and promote T-regulatory cell differentiation, which helps prevent the immune system from attacking 'self' tissue like the thyroid."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Adrenal-Thyroid Crosstalk,' how does chronic high cortisol specifically impact the HPT axis?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the pituitary to overproduce TSH.",
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to the active T3.",
                "It suppresses TSH secretion and inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme.",
                "It lowers Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG) levels significantly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol (HPA activation) sends a signal to the body to conserve energy, resulting in suppressed TSH and decreased peripheral conversion of T4 to T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 explains that Estrogen Dominance increases the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG) in the liver. What is the clinical result of elevated TBG?",
            "options": [
                "Increased Free T3 levels.",
                "Decreased Total T4 levels.",
                "Decreased Free T4 and Free T3 levels (more hormone is 'bound' and inactive).",
                "A significant drop in Reverse T3."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TBG is the 'taxi' for thyroid hormones. When TBG is high (due to high estrogen), more hormone is bound to the protein and less is 'Free' and available for cellular use, often causing hypothyroid symptoms despite 'normal' total levels."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method™ (Lesson 8), what does the 'L' represent in the context of thyroid support?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin Sensitivity",

                "Lymphatic Drainage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'L' stands for Liver. Since approximately 60% of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the liver, optimizing liver function and detoxification pathways is critical for thyroid health."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module regarding the 'Gut-Thyroid Axis' found that patients with Hashimoto's had significantly lower levels of which bacterial phylum compared to healthy controls?",
            "options": [
                "Bacteroidetes",
                "Firmicutes",
                "Proteobacteria",
                "Actinobacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows a reduction in Firmicutes (which produce beneficial SCFAs) and an altered Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Case Synthesis: A client presents with 'normal' TSH (3.8 uIU/mL), high-normal Total T4, but Low-Normal Free T3 and high Estrogen. Which intervention is most logically prioritized based on Module 9 concepts?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate referral for T3-only medication.",
                "High-dose iodine supplementation to force T4 production.",
                "Supporting estrogen metabolism (Liver/Gut) to reduce TBG and free up active T3.",
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to lose weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The high estrogen is likely driving up TBG, which 'soaks up' the Free T3. Addressing the root cause (estrogen dominance/liver clearance) will naturally improve the Free T3 status without the risks of T3-only meds or iodine."
