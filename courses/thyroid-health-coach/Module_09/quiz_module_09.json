            "question": "What is the primary immunological mechanism responsible for the hyperthyroidism seen in Graves' Disease?",
            "options": [
                "Destruction of the thyroid follicles by TPO antibodies",
                "TSH Receptor Antibodies (TRAb) mimicking TSH and overstimulating the gland",
                "Excessive production of Reverse T3 blocking hormone receptors",
                "A deficiency in iodine causing compensatory glandular hypertrophy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Graves' is characterized by the production of TRAb (specifically Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins), which bind to and activate the TSH receptor, leading to autonomous overproduction of T4 and T3."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "When differentiating between hyperthyroidism and clinical anxiety, which physiological sign is most characteristic of hyperthyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "Panic attacks occurring only in crowded spaces",
                "Tachycardia that persists even during sleep or rest",
                "Cold hands and feet during stressful events",
                "Increased muscle tension in the neck and shoulders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike anxiety-induced tachycardia, which is usually situational, hyperthyroid-driven tachycardia is a result of increased beta-adrenergic sensitivity and high circulating hormones, often persisting during sleep."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the medical management of Graves', why is Methimazole (MMI) generally preferred over Propylthiouracil (PTU) for non-pregnant adults?",
            "options": [
                "MMI has a lower risk of severe hepatotoxicity (liver failure)",
                "PTU is more expensive and harder to source",
                "MMI increases the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "PTU is known to cause rapid weight gain in 90% of patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While both are effective, PTU carries a 'black box warning' for severe liver injury and failure, making MMI the first-line choice unless the patient is in their first trimester of pregnancy."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A 2011 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Marcocci et al.) found that which supplement significantly improved quality of life and reduced eye symptoms in mild Graves' Orbitopathy?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C (1000mg daily)",
                "Zinc Picolinate (50mg daily)",
                "Selenium (200mcg daily as sodium selenite)",
                "Magnesium Glycinate (400mg daily)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study showed that 200mcg of Selenium daily for 6 months improved eye involvement and slowed the progression of Graves' ophthalmopathy compared to placebo."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Which pathogen is most strongly associated with Graves' Disease through the mechanism of molecular mimicry due to its TSH-binding sites?",
            "options": [
                "Helicobacter pylori",
                "Yersinia enterocolitica",
                "Staphylococcus aureus",
                "Borrelia burgdorferi"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yersinia enterocolitica contains proteins that bind TSH; antibodies produced against these bacteria can cross-react with the human TSH receptor, triggering the autoimmune response in susceptible individuals."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Using the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale for Thyroid Storm, which of the following scores would indicate a 'Thyroid Storm is highly likely'?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 5-10",
                "A score of 15-20",
                "A score of 25-40",
                "A score of 45 or greater"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A score of 45 or higher on the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (which assesses temperature, CNS effects, GI dysfunction, and cardiovascular status) is highly suggestive of a life-threatening Thyroid Storm."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Following a total thyroidectomy or Radioactive Iodine (RAI) ablation, what is the most important nutritional consideration for the coach to address?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately implementing a strict ketogenic diet to prevent weight gain",
                "Transitioning the protocol to support a post-surgical 'hypothyroid' state and monitoring calcium levels",
                "Increasing iodine intake to 1000mcg to stimulate any remaining tissue",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates to prevent 'thyroid puffiness'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-treatment, patients will inevitably become hypothyroid and require hormone replacement. Additionally, post-thyroidectomy patients must be monitored for hypocalcemia due to potential parathyroid gland trauma."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "During the acute 'hyper' phase of Graves' Disease, why might a health coach suggest a temporary reduction in high-iodine foods like kelp and dulse?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine causes immediate destruction of the thyroid gland",
                "Iodine provides the 'raw material' for the overactive gland to synthesize more thyroid hormone",
                "High iodine intake prevents Methimazole from being absorbed",
                "Iodine increases the risk of developing a gluten sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In an overactive gland, excess iodine acts as 'fuel' for the production of T4 and T3. Reducing iodine intake can help lower the substrate available for hormone synthesis while medical treatments take effect."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "In the Lesson 8 Case Study on Graves' Remission, which lifestyle factor was identified as the primary trigger for the client's relapse?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive consumption of cruciferous vegetables",
                "A sudden increase in dietary saturated fat",
                "Chronic sleep deprivation and high psychological stress",
                "Switching from tap water to filtered water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stress is a major driver of Graves' flares due to the shift toward Th2 immune dominance and the impact of cortisol on immune surveillance; the case study highlighted stress management as the key to sustained remission."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Jod-Basedow' effect in the context of hyperthyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring after the administration of iodine to a person with an underlying thyroid abnormality",
                "The temporary inhibition of thyroid hormone release due to very high iodine doses",
                "The weight gain associated with treating hyperthyroidism too aggressively",
                "The bulging of the eyes associated with Graves' Orbitopathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Jod-Basedow effect occurs when iodine administration triggers hyperthyroidism, particularly in patients with multinodular goiter or Graves' Disease who were previously iodine-deficient."
