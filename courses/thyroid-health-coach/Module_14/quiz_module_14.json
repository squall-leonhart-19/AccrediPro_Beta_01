            "question": "According to the 'Niche Specificity' data presented in Lesson 1, why is a hyper-niche like 'Post-partum Hashimoto's Recovery' more profitable than a general 'Thyroid Coach' title?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for lower pricing due to higher volume",
                "It reduces the need for professional liability insurance",
                "It increases perceived authority and allows for premium value-based pricing",
                "It eliminates the need for a lead magnet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-niche positioning increases the practitioner's perceived authority, solving a specific problem for a specific population, which justifies premium value-based pricing over generic hourly rates."

                "It ensures they receive more physical supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Package pricing shifts the client's focus toward the end transformation (e.g., remission of symptoms) rather than the cost of an individual hour, increasing commitment and perceived value."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, we discussed lead magnet conversion. If a 'Hashimoto's Grocery List' has a 12% conversion rate and a '5-Day Fatigue Reset' has a 34% conversion rate, what does this indicate?",

            "explanation": "High-converting lead magnets typically solve a specific, urgent symptom (like fatigue) rather than providing general information (like a grocery list)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating the concern (Feel), empathizing (Felt), and providing a solution like a joint call (Found) maintains the relationship while moving the enrollment forward."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of 7 suggests that a prospect needs to encounter your brand multiple times across different platforms to build the trust necessary for a high-ticket health investment."
