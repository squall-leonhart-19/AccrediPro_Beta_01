            "question": "Which specific transcriptional coactivator is primarily stimulated by T3 to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and density?",
            "options": [
                "mTORC1",
                "PGC-1alpha",
                "NF-kB",
                "AMPK"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 binds to nuclear receptors that stimulate PGC-1alpha (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that thyroid hormones are responsible for approximately what percentage of a human's total Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "30%",

                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many factors influence metabolism, thyroid hormones (specifically T3) are estimated to control roughly 30% of the BMR through the regulation of ATP turnover and thermogenesis."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'second wind' of energy at 10:00 PM but feels exhausted at 8:00 AM. According to Circadian Biology (L3), what is the most likely endocrine disruption?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive melatonin production",
                "Phase-shifted cortisol rhythm (inverted curve)",
                "Low TSH secretion during the night",
                "High insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'second wind' at night often indicates a phase-shifted cortisol rhythm where cortisol is low in the morning and inappropriately high at night, disrupting the energy cycle."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "How does chronic hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) directly impair thyroid vitality?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates 5'-deiodinase activity",
                "It triggers a cortisol spike that inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It increases the sensitivity of the TSH receptor",
                "It causes the thyroid gland to enlarge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypoglycemia is a physiological stressor that increases cortisol. High cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, leading to lower active T3 and higher Reverse T3."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, what is the recommended maximum duration for intense exercise for a hypothyroid client to avoid 'exercise-induced thyroid suppression'?",

                "15 minutes",
                "45 minutes",
                "90 minutes",
                "120 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To prevent excessive cortisol-induced suppression of T3, hypothyroid clients are generally advised to keep high-intensity sessions under 45 minutes."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "The 'HPT-HPA Cross-Talk' (L6) explains that high levels of CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone) during stress have what effect on the thyroid axis?",
            "options": [
                "They stimulate the release of TSH",
                "They increase the uptake of iodine",
                "They inhibit the release of TSH from the pituitary",
                "They have no effect on the thyroid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis (stress) leads to CRH and cortisol elevations, both of which can suppress the HPT axis by inhibiting TSH secretion."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "When using cold thermogenesis as a hormetic stressor (L7), what is the primary mechanism by which it supports metabolic resilience?",
            "options": [
                "By freezing white adipose tissue",
                "By inducing Mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) in brown fat",
                "By decreasing the heart rate permanently",
                "By reducing the need for T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cold exposure stimulates Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) and UCP1, which 'uncouples' ATP production to generate heat, a process highly dependent on T3."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah has a TSH of 3.8 and low Free T3. She starts a strict zero-carb diet and her fatigue worsens. Why?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrates are required for the thyroid to produce T4",
                "Insulin is a necessary signal for the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3",
                "Zero-carb diets increase the metabolic rate too quickly",
                "She is not eating enough protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin (stimulated by glucose/carbs) is a key signal that upregulates the conversion of T4 to active T3. Very low-carb diets can lead to 'Low T3 Syndrome' in sensitive individuals."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which hormetic stressor should be avoided or used with extreme caution in a client with a TSH above 10 mU/L and severe adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "Red light therapy",
                "Deep breathing exercises",
                "Extended water fasting (over 24 hours)",
                "Walking in nature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extended fasting is a significant metabolic stressor. In a client with high TSH and HPA axis dysfunction, it can further suppress T3 and exacerbate the energy crisis."

            "explanation": "Waking BBT (specifically looking for 97.8-98.2°F / 36.6-36.8°C) is a direct reflection of the thermogenic effect of T3 and cellular energy production."
