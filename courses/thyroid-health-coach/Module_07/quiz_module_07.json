            "question": "The 'Wolff-Chaikoff Effect' refers to which physiological phenomenon regarding iodine?",
            "options": [
                "The rapid increase in T3 production following low-dose iodine supplementation.",
                "A temporary reduction in thyroid hormone synthesis caused by the ingestion of a large amount of iodine.",
                "The permanent destruction of thyroid follicles due to radioactive iodine exposure.",
                "The competitive inhibition of iodine uptake by goitrogens like perchlorate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is a protective mechanism where the thyroid temporarily shuts down hormone synthesis in response to high iodine levels to prevent thyrotoxicosis."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Why is Selenium supplementation often recommended alongside Iodine in Hashimoto's patients?",
            "options": [
                "Selenium increases the absorption of iodine in the small intestine.",
                "Selenium is required to transport iodine across the blood-brain barrier.",
                "Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) neutralizes the H2O2 produced during iodine oxidation, preventing glandular damage.",
                "Selenium acts as a primary fuel source for the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to oxidize iodine. Without sufficient selenium-dependent GPx to neutralize excess H2O2, the thyroid tissue can suffer oxidative damage, exacerbating autoimmunity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Normal' TSH and T4, but T3 is at the bottom of the functional range. Which micronutrient deficiency is most likely hindering the Deiodinase (D1 and D2) enzyme activity?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Zinc",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Manganese"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zinc is a critical cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 into the active T3. Studies show that zinc deficiency can result in low T3 levels despite adequate T4."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO), the enzyme responsible for thyroid hormone synthesis, is dependent on which 'heme' mineral cofactor?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "Iron (as Ferritin)",
                "Copper",
                "Selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TPO is a heme-dependent enzyme. If iron levels (specifically ferritin) are low, TPO activity decreases, leading to primary hypothyroidism even if iodine is sufficient."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In the THRIVE methodology, what is the target functional range for serum Ferritin for optimal thyroid hormone utilization?",
            "options": [
                "10–30 ng/mL",
                "30–50 ng/mL",

                "Over 300 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges start as low as 12 ng/mL, thyroid health coaches look for a functional range of 70–100 ng/mL to ensure adequate oxygenation and TPO enzyme function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Vitamin A (Retinol) is essential for thyroid health because it facilitates the formation of a heterodimer between the Thyroid Hormone Receptor (TR) and which other receptor?",
            "options": [
                "Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)",
                "Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR)",
                "Estrogen Receptor (ER)",
                "Vitamin D Receptor (VDR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Active T3 binds to the TR, which must then pair (heterodimerize) with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), which is Vitamin A dependent, to initiate gene transcription in the cell nucleus."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which B-vitamin is a critical cofactor for the production of ATP required for the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) to actively pump iodine into the thyroid?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)",
                "Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)",
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)",
                "Vitamin B9 (Folate)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Riboflavin (B2) and Niacin (B3) are essential for the electron transport chain and ATP production. Magnesium-dependent ATPase uses this energy to power the NIS for iodine uptake."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "What is the primary role of the amino acid L-Tyrosine in thyroid physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a catalyst for the conversion of T3 to T2.",
                "It provides the structural backbone for the Thyroglobulin (Tg) protein where iodine is attached.",
                "It blocks the absorption of goitrogenic compounds in the gut.",
                "It stimulates the pituitary gland to release more TSH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Tyrosine is the amino acid precursor that, when part of the thyroglobulin protein, accepts iodine atoms to form MIT, DIT, T3, and T4."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "To prevent significant malabsorption of thyroid medication (Levothyroxine), how long should a client wait before taking mineral supplements like Calcium or Iron?",
            "options": [
                "15 minutes",
                "30 minutes",
                "1 hour",
                "4 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Calcium, Iron, and Magnesium can bind to thyroid medication in the gut, significantly reducing its absorption. A 4-hour gap is the clinical standard for these specific minerals."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Goldilocks' principle of Iodine as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine should only be taken in the morning with a high-fat meal.",
                "Both deficiency and excessive intake can trigger thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity.",
                "Iodine is only effective when taken in a 1:1 ratio with Potassium.",
                "Only synthetic iodine is safe; organic iodine from kelp is too volatile."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Goldilocks' principle refers to the narrow therapeutic window of iodine: too little causes deficiency symptoms and goiter, while too much can trigger the Wolff-Chaikoff effect or Hashimoto's flares."
