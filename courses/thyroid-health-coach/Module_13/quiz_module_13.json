            "question": "In advanced lab interpretation, a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (using pg/mL and ng/dL) of less than 20 is most likely indicative of which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal cellular thyroid sensitivity",
                "Hyperthyroidism due to Graves' Disease",

                "Primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Free T3/rT3 ratio below 20 (or below 0.02 if using same units) suggests that the body is prioritizing the production of the inactive Reverse T3 over the active Free T3, often due to systemic inflammation, high cortisol, or nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the Hashimoto’s Phenotype classification, a client presenting with high TPO antibodies but normal ultrasound findings and stable TSH is classified as having:",

                "Seronegative Hashimoto's"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage 2 or 'Silent' Hashimoto's involves the presence of elevated antibodies (TPO or TgAb) without significant TSH elevation or structural damage visible on ultrasound yet."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "How does chronic hypercortisolemia (HPA axis overactivity) specifically impact the HPT axis at the enzymatic level?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates Deiodinase 1 (D1) to increase T3 production",
                "It increases the expression of the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol suppresses the conversion of T4 to T3 by inhibiting D1 and D2 enzymes and promotes the conversion of T4 into Reverse T3 by upregulating the D3 enzyme."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Research on circadian biology indicates that TSH secretion follows a distinct pulsatile rhythm. At what time does TSH typically reach its peak concentration in a healthy individual?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TSH levels are highest during the night, typically peaking between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM, and reach their nadir (lowest point) in the late afternoon."

                "Candida albicans"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "H. pylori infection can lead to atrophic gastritis and altered stomach acidity, which significantly impairs the absorption of T4 medication, necessitating higher dosages."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which Environmental Endocrine Disruptor (EDC) is specifically known to compete with iodine for uptake at the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) in the thyroid gland?",
            "options": [
                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Cellular Hypothyroidism can occur despite 'normal' serum labs. Which enzyme is responsible for the intracellular inactivation of T3 into T2, effectively 'braking' cellular metabolism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deiodinase 3 (D3) is the primary inactivating enzyme; it converts T4 to Reverse T3 and T3 to T2, thereby reducing cellular thyroid signaling."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method, what does the 'A' in the framework represent when addressing complex thyroid cases?",

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a TSH of 2.1 mIU/L, but a Free T3 at the very bottom of the range and high Reverse T3. They report cold intolerance and 15lb weight gain. This is a classic example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "When TSH is normal but the client exhibits low T3 and high rT3 with clinical symptoms, it indicates a peripheral conversion issue or 'Type 2' cellular hypothyroidism rather than a gland failure."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights 'Molecular Mimicry' as a driver for Hashimoto's. Which bacterium has a surface antigen that closely resembles the TSH receptor, potentially triggering cross-reactive antibodies?",
