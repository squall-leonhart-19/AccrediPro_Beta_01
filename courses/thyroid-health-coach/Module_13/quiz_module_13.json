            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 highlights that many thyroid clients are former 'high-achievers' who experience psychological distress when their current energy levels (fatigue) no longer align with their identity as a productive individual."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the coach's desire to fix things for the client, which often triggers resistance (sustain talk) rather than change talk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the genomic effects of T3 and the time required for mitochondrial biogenesis, clients should expect a lag of 4-12 weeks before feeling consistent metabolic shifts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a flare, the body is in a defensive state; coaches should help clients pivot to 'maintenance/recovery mode' to prevent further HPA-axis stress."
