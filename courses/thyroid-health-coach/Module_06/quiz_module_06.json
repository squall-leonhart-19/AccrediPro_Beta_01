            "question": "Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with the thyroid system at multiple points. Which mechanism specifically involves 'receptor antagonism'?",
            "options": [
                "Blocking thyroid hormone from binding to its nuclear receptors (TRα or TRβ)",
                "Increasing the rate of thyroid hormone excretion via the kidneys",
                "Stimulating the thyroid gland to overproduce T4",
                "Enhancing the sensitivity of the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Receptor antagonism occurs when EDCs bind to thyroid hormone receptors without activating them, effectively blocking the actual thyroid hormone from delivering its signal to the cell."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Halogen Competition' theory, why are Fluoride, Bromine, and Chlorine problematic for thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the molecular weight of iodine, making it unusable",
                "They have smaller atomic radii and higher electronegativity, allowing them to displace iodine at the NIS",
                "They cause the thyroid gland to shrink through apoptosis",
                "They convert T4 into Reverse T3 exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to their positions on the periodic table, halogens like Fluoride and Bromine can competitively inhibit iodine uptake by the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) because of their similar chemical properties."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Heavy metals such as Mercury (Hg) and Cadmium (Cd) are particularly damaging to thyroid function because they have a high affinity for which element found in deiodinase enzymes?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "Zinc",
                "Selenium",
                "Iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mercury and other heavy metals bind to selenium, creating selenides. This depletes the bioavailability of selenium required for the Deiodinase enzymes (DIO1, DIO2) to convert T4 into the active T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are often called 'forever chemicals.' What is the approximate biological half-life of PFOA in the human body as discussed in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "24 to 48 hours",
                "3 to 5 weeks",
                "3.8 to 5.4 years",
                "15 to 20 years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PFAS are extremely persistent; PFOA has a human half-life of approximately 3.8 to 5.4 years, meaning even after exposure stops, the thyroid-disrupting effects can linger for a decade or more."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client presents with high levels of Triclosan from excessive use of 'antibacterial' personal care products. What is the primary concern regarding thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "Triclosan mimics TSH and causes hyperthyroidism",
                "Triclosan is structurally similar to thyroid hormone and can interfere with transport and receptor binding",
                "Triclosan destroys the TPO enzyme permanently",
                "Triclosan causes the rapid breakdown of iodine in the blood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triclosan shares a structural resemblance to thyroid hormones (containing phenol rings), which allows it to interfere with thyroid hormone transport proteins and receptor sites."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In the 'Clear Toxins' protocol, which Phase II liver detoxification pathway is most critical for the conjugation and eventual excretion of thyroid hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Methylation",
                "Sulfoxidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones are primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and sulfation. If these Phase II pathways are sluggish, it can lead to an accumulation of 'spent' hormones or toxic metabolites."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "When recommending environmental filtration for a thyroid client, which water filtration method is specifically required to significantly reduce fluoride levels?",
            "options": [
                "Standard carbon pitcher filters",
                "UV light sterilization",
                "Reverse Osmosis or Activated Alumina",
                "Basic sediment pre-filtration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard carbon filters are generally ineffective at removing fluoride. Reverse Osmosis (RO) or specialized Activated Alumina filters are necessary to clear this halogen from drinking water."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Why does the 'Clear Toxins' protocol emphasize optimizing 'Drainage' (bowel movements, hydration) before 'Detoxification' (mobilizing metals)?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent enterohepatic recirculation and 're-toxing' the system",
                "Because toxins can only be moved if the client is in a caloric surplus",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before the protocol ends",
                "Because supplements work better on an empty stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If toxins are mobilized from tissues but the 'drainage' pathways (like the gut) are blocked, the toxins can be reabsorbed into the bloodstream (enterohepatic recirculation), often worsening symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course suggests that high exposure to Phthalates is associated with which specific hormonal shift?",
            "options": [
                "A 10-15% decrease in circulating Total T4 levels",
                "A 50% increase in TSH levels",
                "A total suppression of the Sodium-Iodide Symporter",
                "The development of thyroid nodules in 90% of cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research, including NHANES data analysis, consistently shows that higher urinary phthalate concentrations correlate with a significant decrease (roughly 10-15%) in circulating T4 levels."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah is a competitive swimmer (chlorine exposure) who uses conventional perfumes (phthalates) and drinks tap water (fluoride). Despite a clean diet, her T3 is low. What is the first coaching priority?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe high-dose iodine immediately",
                "Recommend a 7-day water fast to clear chemicals",
                "Identify and reduce 'Body Burden' by switching personal care products and filtering water",
                "Suggest she quit swimming immediately to avoid all chlorine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step in the 'Clear Toxins' protocol is 'Reduction of Inflow.' By switching to safer personal care products and filtering her water, Sarah reduces her total body burden, allowing her natural detox pathways to catch up."
