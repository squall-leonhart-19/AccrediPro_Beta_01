            "question": "In the pathophysiology of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, which immune cell is primarily responsible for the direct apoptotic destruction of thyrocytes?",
            "options": [
                "B-lymphocytes producing TPO antibodies",
                "CD8+ Cytotoxic T-cells",
                "Natural Killer (NK) cells",
                "Mast cells releasing histamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While TPO antibodies are diagnostic markers, the actual tissue destruction in Hashimoto's is primarily mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells infiltrating the thyroid gland and inducing apoptosis."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A breakdown in immune tolerance is often linked to a deficiency or dysfunction in which specific cell population?",
            "options": [
                "Th17 Pro-inflammatory cells",
                "CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-Regulatory (Treg) cells",
                "Memory B-cells",
                "Neutrophils"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T-Regulatory (Treg) cells, specifically those expressing the FoxP3 transcription factor, are responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and suppressing overactive immune responses against the thyroid."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis is most commonly associated with which immunological polarization?",
            "options": [
                "Th2 Dominance (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13)",
                "Th1 Dominance (IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha)",
                "Th9 Dominance (IL-9)",
                "Complete immune exhaustion (Anergy)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hashimoto's is typically characterized by Th1 dominance, which involves cell-mediated immunity and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which cytokine is frequently elevated during a 'Thyroid Flare' and is known to inhibit the conversion of T4 to T3 while increasing Reverse T3 (rT3)?",
            "options": [
                "IL-10",
                "TGF-beta",
                "IL-6",
                "IL-2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IL-6 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that contributes to the 'cytokine storm' effect, suppresses TSH, and impairs peripheral T4 to T3 conversion by affecting deiodinase activity."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Molecular Mimicry' theory, why does gluten consumption often trigger a Hashimoto's flare?",
            "options": [
                "Gluten contains high levels of iodine which poisons the thyroid",
                "The protein structure of alpha-gliadin resembles the structure of Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Gluten increases stomach acid, which destroys thyroid hormones",
                "Gluten binds directly to T3 receptors, blocking hormone action"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs because the amino acid sequence of alpha-gliadin (in gluten) is similar to the TPO enzyme, causing the immune system to cross-react and attack thyroid tissue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "What is the proposed mechanism of action for Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN) in treating thyroid autoimmunity?",
            "options": [
                "It permanently destroys overactive B-cells",
                "It acts as a synthetic thyroid hormone replacement",
                "It causes a brief blockade of opioid receptors, leading to a compensatory increase in endogenous endorphins and Treg function",
                "It increases the absorption of Selenium in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LDN works through a 'rebound effect'; by briefly blocking opioid receptors, the body increases production of met-enkephalin and endorphins, which helps upregulate T-Regulatory cell function and balance the immune system."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Which of the following foods is EXCLUDED on the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) but typically allowed on a standard Modified Paleo diet?",
            "options": [
                "Refined Sugar",
                "Grass-fed Beef",
                "Nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers)",
                "Gluten-containing grains"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AIP is more restrictive than Modified Paleo, specifically excluding nightshades, eggs, nuts, and seeds during the elimination phase to further reduce potential immune triggers."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A 2017 meta-analysis suggested that Selenium supplementation (as selenomethionine) can reduce TPO antibody titers by approximately what percentage over 3-6 months?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "20-40%",
                "75-90%",
                "0% (Selenium has no effect on antibodies)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies and meta-analyses have shown that 200mcg of Selenium daily can reduce TPO antibodies by roughly 20-40% in many Hashimoto's patients by reducing oxidative stress."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "When managing an acute Hashimoto's flare, which intervention is considered the highest priority in the THRIVE Phase I protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing aerobic exercise intensity to 'burn off' inflammation",
                "Aggressive thyroid hormone dose increases",
                "Identifying and removing the immediate trigger (e.g., recent infection, gluten exposure) and calming the cytokine response",
                "Starting a high-fiber grain-based diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I focuses on 'Calming the Fire.' The priority is identifying the trigger and using anti-inflammatory strategies (like Vitamin D, Curcumin, or AIP) to modulate the immune response before moving to deeper metabolic work."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 34, has TPO antibodies of 850 IU/mL and Vitamin D levels of 22 ng/mL. What is the target Vitamin D range recommended in the course for optimal immune modulation in Hashimoto's?",
            "options": [
                "20-30 ng/mL",
                "30-50 ng/mL",
                "60-80 ng/mL",
                "120-150 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For autoimmune patients, functional medicine standards and the THRIVE protocol target a Vitamin D (25-OH) range of 60-80 ng/mL to maximize the genomic effects on T-Regulatory cell production."
