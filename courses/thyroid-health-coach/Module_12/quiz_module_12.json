        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the immunology of Hashimoto’s, which specific subset of T-cells is responsible for suppressing the autoimmune response and maintaining 'self-tolerance'?",
            "options": [
                "Th17 Pro-inflammatory cells",
                "CD8+ Cytotoxic T-cells",
                "T-Regulatory (Treg) cells",
                "Th2 B-cell activating cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T-Regulatory (Treg) cells are the 'peacekeepers' of the immune system. In Hashimoto's, a deficiency or dysfunction in Tregs allows Th1 and Th17 cells to attack thyroid tissue unchecked."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry between alpha-gliadin (gluten) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) occurs primarily because of which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "They share identical DNA sequences",
                "Structural similarity in amino acid sequences (epitopes)",
                "Both proteins are digested by the same enzymes",
                "Gluten binds directly to the TSH receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign antigen (like gliadin) with a self-antigen (like TPO) due to similar amino acid sequences or structural shapes known as epitopes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Three Pillars of Autoimmunity' model proposed by Dr. Alessio Fasano, which of the following is a mandatory requirement for the development of Hashimoto's?",
            "options": [
                "Complete absence of iodine in the diet",
                "A prior diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes",
                "Increased Intestinal Permeability (Leaky Gut)",
                "Total suppression of the HPA-axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fasano's model posits that three factors must coexist for autoimmunity: genetic susceptibility, an environmental trigger, and increased intestinal permeability."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which latent viral pathogen is most frequently cited in clinical literature as a trigger for Hashimoto's via 'bystander activation'?",
            "options": [
                "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)",
                "Rhinovirus",
                "Hepatitis A",
                "Norovirus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EBV is a potent trigger; when it infects thyroid cells, the immune system attacks the infected cells, causing 'bystander' damage to healthy thyroid tissue and releasing thyroid antigens into the bloodstream."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "When personalizing the Autoimmune Paleo (AIP) framework, what is the primary goal of the 'Reintroduction Phase'?",
            "options": [
                "To return to a standard Western diet as quickly as possible",
                "To identify specific food triggers while maintaining the broadest nutrient density possible",
                "To prove that the client no longer has Hashimoto's",
                "To increase caloric intake by adding processed sugars"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of AIP is not permanent restriction, but identifying which specific foods trigger an immune response for that individual so they can enjoy a diverse, nutrient-dense diet without flares."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "How does chronic HPA-axis activation (elevated cortisol) directly impair thyroid function at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It stimulates the pituitary to overproduce TSH",
                "It promotes the conversion of T4 into the inactive metabolite Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 to active T3, instead shunting T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3) pathway."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which mycotoxin is specifically noted for its ability to deplete glutathione and disrupt the intestinal barrier, potentially triggering an autoimmune flare?",
            "options": [
                "Ochratoxin A",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Chlorophyll",
                "Resveratrol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ochratoxin A is a nephrotoxic and immunotoxic mycotoxin that induces oxidative stress, depletes glutathione, and causes intestinal permeability, all of which exacerbate Hashimoto's."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In monitoring Hashimoto's remission, why is tracking TPO antibodies (TPOAb) often more useful than tracking TSH alone?",
            "options": [
                "TSH is never accurate in Hashimoto's patients",
                "TPOAb levels better reflect the current intensity of the immune system's attack on the gland",
                "TPOAb levels determine the exact dosage of Levothyroxine needed",
                "TSH only changes once a year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While TSH measures the pituitary's demand for hormone, TPOAb levels provide a 'real-time' window into the degree of autoimmune activity and inflammation occurring within the thyroid gland."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study on Hashimoto's patients found that approximately what percentage of individuals with 'normal' TSH levels still reported significant fatigue and brain fog?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Up to 40-60%",
                "100% of all patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that a significant portion (often 40-60%) of Hashimoto's patients remain symptomatic despite 'normal' TSH, highlighting the need for addressing systemic inflammation and nutrient status."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah has high TPO antibodies and 'Leaky Gut.' After 3 months on AIP, her gut symptoms improved, but her antibodies remain high. What is the most logical next step in her modulation protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Switch to a high-carb vegan diet immediately",
                "Screen for stealth pathogens (like EBV) or environmental toxins (like mycotoxins)",
                "Increase her aerobic exercise to 2 hours per day",
                "Stop all supplements and reintroduce gluten"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If dietary changes (Pillar 3) improve gut health but antibodies remain high, the practitioner must look for remaining 'triggers' (Pillar 2), such as chronic infections or environmental toxins that continue to stimulate the immune system."
