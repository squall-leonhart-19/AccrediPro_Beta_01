            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "The 'Endocrine Triangle' describes the complex feedback loops between which three primary systems?",
            "options": [
                "Hypothalamus, Pituitary, and Liver",
                "Thyroid, Adrenals, and Ovaries/Gonads",
                "Pancreas, Gut, and Thyroid",
                "Thyroid, Pineal Gland, and Thymus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Endocrine Triangle refers to the bidirectional relationship between the thyroid, adrenal glands, and the gonads (ovaries in women), where dysfunction in one axis inevitably impacts the other two."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which enzyme is primarily inhibited by high levels of cortisol, leading to decreased T3 production and increased Reverse T3 (rT3)?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Aromatase",
                "5'-deiodinase",
                "11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol (stress) inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, while simultaneously shunting T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3) form."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "How does estrogen dominance contribute to functional hypothyroidism even when the thyroid gland is producing sufficient hormones?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which sequesters free hormones.",
                "It directly destroys thyroid follicular cells through oxidative stress.",
                "It prevents the pituitary gland from releasing TSH.",
                "It increases the rapid clearance of T3 through the kidneys."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excess estrogen (estrogen dominance) increases the liver's production of TBG. Higher TBG levels mean more thyroid hormone is bound and 'locked up,' leaving less 'Free' T4 and T3 available for cellular use."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Progesterone's role in thyroid health is unique because it primarily affects which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "The synthesis of iodine into T4",
                "The conversion of TSH to T4",
                "The sensitivity and efficiency of thyroid hormone receptors",
                "The reduction of Reverse T3 in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While estrogen increases TBG, progesterone helps sensitize thyroid receptors, making the available thyroid hormone more effective at the cellular level."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A 2021 study involving 2,500 patients found that individuals with higher insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly more likely to present with:",
            "options": [
                "Hyperthyroidism and Grave's Disease",
                "Increased thyroid volume and a higher prevalence of thyroid nodules",
                "A complete lack of TSH production",
                "Excessively high levels of iodine excretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia acts as a growth factor for thyroid tissue; insulin resistance is strongly correlated with increased thyroid gland volume and the formation of nodules."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Metabolic Set Point,' why is leptin signaling critical for thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin converts T4 to T3 in the muscle tissue.",
                "Leptin is a precursor to TSH.",
                "Leptin signals the hypothalamus to release Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH).",
                "Leptin inhibits the production of cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leptin acts as a metabolic gatekeeper; when leptin levels are low (or the brain is leptin-resistant), the hypothalamus reduces TRH production, effectively slowing the thyroid to conserve energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Why is it clinically risky to provide high-dose thyroid replacement to a client with unaddressed, severe adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol)?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormone will cause the body to store more cortisol in fat cells.",
                "Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of cortisol, potentially precipitating an adrenal crisis.",
                "Thyroid hormone converts directly into estrogen in the absence of cortisol.",
                "It is not risky; thyroid hormone always supports the adrenals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate, which includes the rate at which the body uses and clears cortisol. If cortisol stores are already depleted, increasing thyroid hormone can lead to an acute adrenal crisis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH and T4, but low Free T3 and high Estrogen. According to the THRIVE Phase H protocol, which approach is most logical?",
            "options": [
                "Increase iodine intake immediately to 1500mcg.",
                "Focus on liver detoxification and bowel regularity to clear excess estrogen and reduce TBG.",
                "Request a prescription for T3-only medication.",
                "Ignore the estrogen levels as they do not affect thyroid conversion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because estrogen dominance increases TBG (which lowers free hormones) and can impair liver conversion, addressing estrogen clearance is a priority to restore 'Free' hormone availability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Which of the following statistics regarding the HPA-HPT cross-talk was highlighted in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "90% of thyroid patients have Addison's disease.",
                "Up to 75% of patients with chronic HPA axis activation show 'Low T3 Syndrome' patterns.",
                "Cortisol increases T4 production by 50%.",
                "Insulin resistance has no impact on T3 levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and HPA axis activation are major drivers of 'Low T3 Syndrome,' where TSH is normal but T3 is low due to poor peripheral conversion and high rT3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Restoring Endocrine Cross-Talk' protocol, what is the 'First Pillar' of stabilization before hormonal manipulation?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Strict caloric restriction",
                "Blood sugar stabilization and Circadian Rhythm alignment",
                "Suppressive doses of T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Before the thyroid, adrenals, and ovaries can synchronize, the 'foundation' of blood sugar stability (to manage insulin) and circadian rhythm (to manage cortisol) must be established."
