            "question": "In the context of Metabolic Typing, a 'Slow Oxidizer' typically requires which macronutrient ratio to optimize thyroid-driven energy production?",
            "options": [
                "High protein, high fat, and low carbohydrate (30/50/20)",
                "High carbohydrate, moderate protein, and low fat (60/25/15)",
                "Equal parts protein, fat, and carbohydrate (33/33/33)",
                "Zero carbohydrate, high fat, and moderate protein (5/75/20)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow oxidizers typically have a more sluggish metabolism and require more complex carbohydrates to stimulate thyroid activity and prevent further metabolic slowing, whereas fast oxidizers require more fats and proteins to slow down oxidation."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological mechanism by which 'Carbohydrate Cycling' supports T3 optimization?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the production of Reverse T3 (rT3) by lowering cortisol levels.",
                "It increases the half-life of T4 in the bloodstream.",
                "Insulin spikes from refeed days stimulate the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which converts T4 into active T3.",
                "It prevents the thyroid gland from absorbing too much iodine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin is a key signaling molecule for the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Strategic carbohydrate refeeds provide the insulin signal necessary to activate the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, especially after periods of caloric or carb restriction."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3 suggests that long-term ketogenic diets may lead to 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' in some patients. What is the hallmark of this condition?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated TSH with elevated T4",
                "Low T3 levels with normal TSH and normal T4",
                "Low TSH with high T3",
                "High rT3 with low T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Euthyroid Sick Syndrome (or Non-Thyroidal Illness Syndrome) in keto patients often manifests as low T3 levels despite 'normal' TSH and T4, as the body attempts to conserve energy in response to perceived glucose deprivation."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "For a female client with Hashimoto's and adrenal sensitivity, what is the maximum recommended fasting window to avoid significant HPA-axis disruption?",
            "options": [
                "18-20 hours",
                "24 hours",
                "12-14 hours",
                "16-18 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 emphasizes that longer fasting windows (over 16 hours) can spike cortisol, which inhibits T4 to T3 conversion. A 12-14 hour window is generally the 'sweet spot' for thyroid clients to gain autophagy benefits without metabolic stress."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the protein requirements for metabolic repair, a 70kg (154lb) hypothyroid client should aim for how many grams of protein daily?",
            "options": [
                "50-60 grams",
                "84-112 grams",
                "140-160 grams",
                "35-45 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The lesson recommends 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight for thyroid clients to support muscle mass and enzyme production. 70kg x 1.2 = 84g; 70kg x 1.6 = 112g."

            "question": "Which specific goitrogen found in cruciferous vegetables is significantly reduced (up to 90%) by boiling or steaming, making them safer for thyroid patients?",
            "options": [
                "Isothiocyanates",
                "Oxalates",
                "Phytic Acid",
                "Solanine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Isothiocyanates are the primary goitrogenic compounds in cruciferous vegetables that interfere with iodine uptake. Heat treatment (boiling/steaming) denatures the myrosinase enzyme required to produce these compounds."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "The THRIVE Method™ utilizes 'Phase 2: Restoration.' What is the primary nutritional focus during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric deficit for weight loss",
                "Elimination of all nightshades and grains",
                "Nutrient density and replenishing depleted minerals like Selenium and Zinc",
                "Transitioning the client into permanent ketosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 2 (Restoration) of the THRIVE Method™ focuses on flooding the body with the specific micronutrients required for thyroid hormone synthesis and conversion, such as Selenium, Zinc, and Vitamin A."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 42-year-old with hypothyroidism, consumes 3 cups of raw spinach in smoothies daily and reports new-onset joint pain and kidney stones. Which anti-nutrient is likely the culprit?",
            "options": [
                "Lectins",
                "Goitrogens",
                "Oxalates",
                "Saponins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Raw spinach is extremely high in oxalates. In susceptible individuals, high oxalate intake can lead to calcium-oxalate kidney stones and systemic 'oxalate dumping' which manifests as joint and muscle pain."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In Culinary Medicine, why is it recommended to soak and sprout legumes before consumption for thyroid clients?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the iodine content of the beans",
                "To reduce lectins and phytic acid which can trigger gut inflammation and molecular mimicry",
                "To convert the starch into healthy fats",
                "To deactivate the T3 hormones naturally found in plants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soaking and sprouting reduces anti-nutrients like lectins and phytates. This is crucial for thyroid clients, as lectins can contribute to intestinal permeability (leaky gut), a known trigger for autoimmune Hashimoto's."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Thyroid-Boosting' culinary practice mentioned in Lesson 8 to enhance the bio-availability of Vitamin A (Retinol)?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming carrots only in raw, juiced form",
                "Pairing orange-colored vegetables with a healthy fat source like avocado or ghee",
                "Avoiding all yellow vegetables to prevent carotenemia",
                "Freezing vegetables for at least 48 hours before cooking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for thyroid hormone receptor sensitivity. Pairing beta-carotene rich foods with fats is necessary for conversion and absorption, especially since hypothyroid clients often struggle to convert beta-carotene to active retinol."
