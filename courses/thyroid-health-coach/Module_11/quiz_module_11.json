            "question": "According to Lesson 1, what percentage of T4 to T3 conversion is estimated to occur in a healthy gut microbiome through the activity of intestinal sulfatase enzymes?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 45%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that about 20% of T4 is converted into the active T3 form in the gut by the action of the enzyme intestinal sulfatase, which is produced by beneficial gut bacteria."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Nutrient Synergies' (Lesson 2), why is Vitamin A (Retinol) considered essential for thyroid hormone function at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "It is required for the intestinal absorption of Iodine",
                "It is a necessary co-factor for the T3 receptor (TR) to form a heterodimer with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) to bind to DNA",
                "It prevents the oxidation of Selenium in the blood",
                "It stimulates the pituitary gland to release more TSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 cannot effectively initiate gene transcription alone; the thyroid hormone receptor must pair with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), which is Vitamin A dependent, to bind to Thyroid Response Elements (TRE) on DNA."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Based on the chronobiology of the HPT axis discussed in Lesson 3, at what time of day does TSH typically reach its highest serum concentration?",
            "options": [
                "Between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM",
                "Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM",
                "Between 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM",
                "Between 12:00 AM and 4:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "TSH follows a distinct circadian rhythm, peaking during the overnight hours (usually between midnight and 4 AM) and reaching its nadir in the late afternoon."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (EDCs). Which mechanism is specifically associated with PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) regarding thyroid interference?",
            "options": [
                "They block the NIS symporter, preventing iodine uptake",
                "They competitively bind to Transthyretin (TTR), displacing T4 from its transport protein",
                "They cause the immediate destruction of the thyroid follicle cells",
                "They increase the half-life of TSH in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PFAS compounds have a high affinity for Transthyretin (TTR), a major thyroid hormone transport protein, and can displace T4, leading to altered delivery of hormones to tissues."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When interpreting subclinical patterns (Lesson 5), a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio (using pg/mL units) below which value is a clinical indicator of poor peripheral conversion or 'cellular hypothyroidism'?",
            "options": [
                "Ratio below 2",
                "Ratio below 10",
                "Ratio below 20",
                "Ratio below 50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine, a Free T3/Reverse T3 ratio (pg/mL) of 20 or higher is typically considered optimal; a ratio below 20 suggests that the body is prioritizing the production of the inactive Reverse T3 over active T3."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "According to the HPA-HPT crosstalk dynamics (Lesson 6), how does chronically elevated cortisol affect the deiodinase enzymes?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Type 1 deiodinase (D1) activity",
                "It inhibits Type 1 deiodinase (D1) and Type 2 deiodinase (D2), while increasing Type 3 deiodinase (D3)",
                "It has no effect on deiodinase enzymes",
                "It converts Reverse T3 back into T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels (stress) inhibit the enzymes responsible for converting T4 to T3 (D1 and D2) and upregulate Type 3 deiodinase (D3), which converts T4 into inactive Reverse T3."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses Mitochondrial Bioenergetics. Which protein does T3 regulate to increase basal metabolic rate and stimulate thermogenesis?",

                "Myosin Light Chain Kinase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T3 increases the expression of Uncoupling Proteins (UCPs) in the mitochondria, which allows protons to leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, generating heat instead of ATP."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method (Lesson 8), what does the 'L' represent in the integration of thyroid health?",

                "Luteinizing Hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'L' in the B.A.L.A.N.C.E. Method stands for Liver and Lymphatic Clearance, emphasizing the liver's role in T4-T3 conversion and the removal of endocrine-disrupting toxins."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH (2.8 mIU/L) and Free T4, but low Free T3 and high Reverse T3. Based on Lesson 5 and 6, which intervention is most appropriate to address the underlying mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Increase Iodine dosage immediately",
                "Prescribe high-intensity interval training (HIIT) 6 days a week",

                "Switch to a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This pattern (low T3, high rT3) is characteristic of 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' or cellular hypothyroidism, often driven by high cortisol or inflammation, making HPA axis support the priority."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Lesson 1 notes that Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut dysbiosis can impair thyroid function. What is the primary mechanism for this?",
            "options": [
                "LPS directly binds to TSH receptors in the thyroid",
                "LPS triggers systemic inflammation that downregulates TSH expression and impairs T4 to T3 conversion",
                "LPS increases the absorption of Calcium, which blocks T4",
                "LPS promotes the rapid excretion of Iodine through the kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) from Gram-negative bacteria trigger inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-6, which suppress the HPT axis at the hypothalamic level and inhibit peripheral T4 to T3 conversion."
