            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "A standard lab reference range for TSH often goes up to 4.5 or 5.0 mIU/L. According to the THRIVE methodology and functional medicine standards, what is the 'Optimal' range for TSH in a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 mIU/L",
                "1.0 - 2.5 mIU/L",
                "2.5 - 4.0 mIU/L",
                "4.5 - 10.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs use a broad population average, functional 'optimal' ranges focus on the level where most patients report being symptom-free, typically between 1.0 and 2.5 mIU/L."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the most clinically significant 'active' hormone, responsible for binding to nuclear receptors and stimulating metabolic activity?",
            "options": [
                "Total T4",
                "Reverse T3 (RT3)",
                "Free T3 (FT3)",
                "Thyroglobulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Free T3 is the unbound, biologically active form of thyroid hormone that enters cells to regulate metabolism. Total T4 is a pro-hormone and largely bound to carrier proteins."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, we discussed Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. What does a positive TPO antibody test indicate, even if TSH and Free T4 are within normal lab ranges?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine toxicity",
                "Active autoimmune destruction of thyroid tissue (Hashimoto's)",
                "A temporary state of hyperthyroidism",
                "The patient is definitely consuming too much selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TPO antibodies are markers of an autoimmune attack on the thyroid gland. Their presence can precede a rise in TSH by several years, identifying Hashimoto's in the early stages."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Using the Basal Body Temperature (BBT) tracking method from Lesson 5, what morning temperature threshold (taken before rising) is often a clinical indicator of a low metabolic rate?",
            "options": [
                "Below 98.6°F (37.0°C)",
                "Below 97.8°F (36.5°C)",
                "Above 99.1°F (37.3°C)",
                "Below 95.0°F (35.0°C)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A consistent waking BBT below 97.8°F (36.5°C) is a classic functional sign of hypothyroidism or impaired thermogenesis, as thyroid hormones regulate the body's 'thermostat.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a TSH of 6.2 mIU/L but their Free T4 is 1.2 ng/dL (within the standard lab range). How is this pattern classified in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "Overt Hypothyroidism",
                "Secondary Hypothyroidism",
                "Subclinical Hypothyroidism",
                "Euthyroid Sick Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Subclinical Hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH (typically 4.5–10.0) while the actual thyroid hormone levels (Free T4) remain within the laboratory's 'normal' range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "According to the THRIVE Clinical Intake Assessment, which physiological sign is most likely to correlate with a 'Poor T4 to T3 Conversion' pattern?",
            "options": [
                "High resting heart rate (>90 bpm)",
                "Low Free T3 with a high Reverse T3 (RT3)",
                "Low TSH with high Free T4",
                "High levels of Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the body is under stress or lacks nutrients like selenium and zinc, it may divert T4 into Reverse T3 (an inactive 'brake') instead of active Free T3, indicating a conversion issue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical reason for testing Reverse T3 (RT3) in a comprehensive thyroid panel?",
            "options": [
                "To measure the body's iodine stores",
                "To identify if the body is in a 'metabolic conservation' mode due to stress or illness",
                "To confirm a diagnosis of Grave's Disease",
                "To determine the dosage of T4-only medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RT3 acts as a competitive inhibitor to T3. High levels suggest the body is slowing down metabolism in response to physiological or psychological stress, inflammation, or caloric restriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the Case Study from Lesson 8 (Sarah, age 34), her TSH was 3.2 and her FT4 was optimal, yet she remained symptomatic. What was the 'hidden' lab finding that explained her fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated TPO antibodies indicating silent Hashimoto's",
                "Extremely high Free T3 causing 'thyroid burnout'",
                "Low Vitamin D levels only",
                "A TSH of 0.1 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that many clients have 'normal' TSH/T4 but carry high antibodies (TPO), which causes systemic inflammation and hypothyroid symptoms long before the gland fails."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "When assessing the 'Free T3 / Reverse T3 Ratio,' what is generally considered the functional goal for a healthy metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "A ratio below 2",
                "A ratio above 20 (when using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for RT3)",
                "The ratio does not matter if TSH is normal",
                "A ratio of exactly 1:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A higher ratio (typically >20) suggests that the body is efficiently converting T4 into the active T3 rather than the inhibitory Reverse T3."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which of the following pulse patterns is most commonly associated with 'Functional Hypothyroidism' during the THRIVE tracking phase?",
            "options": [
                "A resting pulse of 85-95 bpm",
                "A resting pulse consistently below 65 bpm",
                "Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) only",
                "A pulse that doubles upon standing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones have a chronotropic effect on the heart. A low resting pulse (bradycardia), often below 65 bpm, is a clinical marker of low thyroid status and reduced metabolic rate."
