            "question": "According to the 'Three Pillars of Autoimmunity' framework established by Dr. Alessio Fasano, which three factors must be present for Hashimoto's to manifest?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine deficiency, high TSH, and chronic stress",
                "Genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger, and intestinal permeability",
                "Th1 dominance, low Vitamin D, and viral reactivation",
                "Molecular mimicry, heavy metal toxicity, and TPO antibodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Fasano's research highlights that genetics, a trigger, and 'leaky gut' (intestinal permeability) are the necessary components for the development and persistence of autoimmune disease."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the pathophysiology of Hashimoto's, what is the primary role of Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) that makes it a target for the immune system?",
            "options": [
                "It transports T4 into the peripheral cells",
                "It converts T4 into the active T3 hormone in the liver",
                "It catalyzes the oxidation of iodide and the organification of iodine to thyroglobulin",
                "It signals the pituitary gland to release more TSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TPO is the enzyme responsible for iodine organification. In Hashimoto's, the immune system produces antibodies (TPOAb) that attack this enzyme, leading to lymphocytic infiltration and tissue destruction."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which mechanism explains why the immune system might attack thyroid tissue after a client consumes gluten?",
            "options": [
                "The Bystander Effect",
                "Molecular Mimicry",
                "The Hygiene Hypothesis",
                "Cytokine Storm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs because the protein structure of gliadin (in gluten) closely resembles the molecular structure of the thyroid gland, causing the immune system to confuse the two."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A 2017 study found that elevated levels of which protein are highly correlated with intestinal permeability and the progression of Hashimoto's?",
            "options": [
                "Albumin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Ferritin",
                "Homocysteine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; when elevated, it leads to increased intestinal permeability, allowing triggers to enter the bloodstream."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "When addressing the HPA-HPT axis, how does chronic elevation of cortisol specifically impact thyroid hormone levels?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, reducing T3 and increasing Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "It stimulates the pituitary to overproduce TSH",
                "It enhances the sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol inhibits the conversion of T4 to the active T3 and instead diverts T4 into the inactive rT3, leading to 'cellular hypothyroidism' despite normal lab values."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the context of immune modulation (Lesson 6), what is the primary goal of a Health Coach when working with an 'overactive' immune system?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress the immune system using immunosuppressants",
                "To eliminate all white blood cells to stop the attack",
                "To support Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) to restore immune tolerance",
                "To stimulate the Th1 pathway to fight off the thyroid antibodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Immune modulation aims to balance the system, specifically by supporting Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) which act as the 'peacekeepers' of the immune system to reduce self-attack."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is categorized as a 'biological trigger' in Hashimoto's as discussed in Lesson 5?",

                "Bisphenol A (BPA) from plastics",
                "Excessive intake of fluoride"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the others are chemical or toxic triggers, EBV is a biological (viral) trigger known for its role in 'The Bystander Effect' within the thyroid gland."

                "Elevated TSH and low T4",
                "Normal TSH and T4, but positive TPO or Tg antibodies",
                "Low TSH and high T3",
                "Normal antibodies but high Reverse T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Silent autoimmunity (Stage 2) is characterized by the presence of antibodies indicating an immune attack, even though the thyroid is still producing enough hormone to keep TSH and T4 within range."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a key component of glutathione peroxidase, which neutralizes the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced during thyroid hormone synthesis, preventing damage to the gland."
