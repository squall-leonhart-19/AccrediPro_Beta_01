            "question": "Which biochemical mechanism explains why fluoride, bromide, and chlorine negatively impact thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the rate of T4 to T3 conversion in the liver.",
                "They compete for the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) due to their similar atomic radius to iodine.",
                "They stimulate the thyroid gland to overproduce TPO antibodies.",
                "They bind to Thyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG) and prevent hormone transport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, bromide, and chlorine are halogens. Because they are in the same column of the periodic table as iodine, they can 'mimic' iodine and occupy the NIS, effectively blocking iodine uptake into the thyroid follicular cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'fragrance' (parfum) is identified as a major source of which endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC)?",
            "options": [
                "Organophosphates",
                "Perchlorate",
                "Phthalates",
                "Heavy metals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are frequently used as solvents and fixatives in synthetic fragrances. They are known to interfere with thyroid hormone signaling and are linked to lower circulating T4 levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to research cited in Lesson 3, how does Bisphenol A (BPA) specifically disrupt thyroid signaling at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a thyroid hormone receptor antagonist, blocking T3 from binding.",
                "It causes the immediate destruction of the thyroid gland.",
                "It increases the production of iodine in the blood.",
                "It prevents the pituitary gland from secreting TSH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BPA has been shown to bind to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) with an antagonistic effect, meaning it occupies the receptor but does not trigger the metabolic response, effectively 'silencing' the hormone's message."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "What is the primary impact of excessive blue light exposure after sunset on the thyroid axis?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a rapid increase in T3 levels leading to anxiety.",
                "It suppresses melatonin, which is required to signal the nocturnal surge of TSH.",
                "It increases the absorption of fluoride in the gut.",
                "It has no impact on the thyroid, only on the adrenal glands."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The circadian rhythm regulates the HPT axis. Melatonin suppression by blue light at night disrupts the natural nocturnal rise in TSH, which is essential for maintaining thyroid homeostasis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "When creating a 'Thyroid-Safe Home,' which water filtration technology is specifically required to remove fluoride effectively?",
            "options": [
                "Standard carbon pitcher filters",
                "UV light sterilization",
                "Reverse Osmosis or Activated Alumina",
                "Sediment pre-filters"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard carbon filters are excellent for chlorine but generally do not remove fluoride. Reverse Osmosis (RO) or specialized Activated Alumina filters are necessary to strip fluoride from municipal water."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client presents with 'over-training burnout'—high cortisol and low T3. What is the physiological reason for their low T3 despite a normal TSH?",
            "options": [
                "The thyroid gland has stopped producing T4 entirely.",
                "Excessive cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, shunting T4 into Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "Exercise increases iodine excretion in sweat to dangerous levels.",
                "The client is not eating enough carbohydrates to stimulate TSH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic over-training creates a stress response where high cortisol levels inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3, instead favoring the production of the inactive metabolite Reverse T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In Circadian Biology (Lesson 7), what is the recommended 'Metabolic Window' for meal timing to optimize thyroid-driven thermogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "Eating most calories late at night to fuel sleep.",
                "Skipping breakfast and eating only between 2 PM and 10 PM.",
                "Consuming a high-protein breakfast shortly after waking and finishing the final meal 3-4 hours before bed.",
                "Eating small snacks every 2 hours regardless of the time of day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) aligns with the body's natural insulin sensitivity and leptin rhythms, which support thyroid function and metabolic rate more effectively than late-night eating."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "During the '30-Day Environmental Cleanse' protocol, which of the following is considered a 'Tier 1' (highest priority) action?",
            "options": [
                "Replacing all furniture in the house with organic hemp.",
                "Switching to a glass or stainless steel water bottle and filtering drinking water.",
                "Buying an expensive EMF-shielding tent for the bed.",
                "Moving to a high-altitude climate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol prioritizes high-impact, low-cost changes first. Reducing plastic contact (BPA/Phthalates) and filtering water (Halogens) provide the most significant reduction in thyroid-disrupting 'toxic load' for most clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study discussed in the module found that individuals with the highest urinary concentrations of phthalates had a ____% lower free T4 level compared to the lowest quartile.",
            "options": [
                "2%",
                "5%",
                "10-15%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows a 10-15% reduction in circulating free T4 in populations with high phthalate exposure, which is clinically significant for hypothyroid patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which exercise 'prescription' is most appropriate for a client in the THRIVE Phase E who is still struggling with fatigue and a TSH of 5.0?",
            "options": [
                "Daily 45-minute HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) sessions.",
                "Long-distance marathon training to 'jumpstart' metabolism.",
                "Walking in nature (Zone 2) and restorative yoga 3-4 times per week.",
                "No movement at all until TSH is below 2.0."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For clients with elevated TSH and fatigue, high-intensity exercise can further suppress T3 and exhaust the adrenals. Low-intensity, 'parasympathetic-forward' movement like walking and yoga supports the thyroid without causing a cortisol spike."
