            "question": "In Advanced Interpretation of Baseline Testing (L1), a Free T3 to Reverse T3 ratio of less than 20 (when using pg/mL for FT3 and ng/dL for rT3) most likely indicates which clinical state?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal cellular thyroid sensitivity",
                "Peripheral T4 to T3 conversion inhibition or 'Cellular Hypothyroidism'",
                "Primary hyperthyroidism due to Graves' Disease",
                "Iron deficiency anemia causing elevated TPO antibodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low FT3/rT3 ratio suggests that the body is diverting T4 into the inactive rT3 form rather than the active T3 form, often due to stress, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Three-Legged Stool' model of Hashimoto’s pathophysiology (L2), which three factors must be present for the autoimmune expression to occur?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine deficiency, high TSH, and pituitary dysfunction",
                "Genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger, and intestinal permeability",

                "Adrenal fatigue, liver congestion, and estrogen dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Three-Legged Stool model, popularized by Dr. Alessio Fasano, posits that genetics, a trigger (like gluten or a virus), and a 'leaky' gut (permeability) are the required components for autoimmunity."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "How does chronic cortisol elevation specifically interfere with the HPA-Thyroid axis (L3)?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI)",
                "It increases the sensitivity of the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS)",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, reducing the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It directly destroys the follicular cells of the thyroid gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels suppress the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting the pro-hormone T4 into the active hormone T3 in peripheral tissues."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the context of Halogen Displacement (L4), why are Bromine and Fluorine particularly disruptive to thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "They have a higher atomic weight than Iodine, causing the thyroid to sink",
                "They share the same column on the periodic table and compete for the same receptors/transporters as Iodine",
                "They act as antioxidants that neutralize the hydrogen peroxide needed for TPO activity",
                "They increase the renal clearance of TSH, leading to false low readings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As halogens, Bromine and Fluorine compete with Iodine for uptake via the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS) and for binding sites on thyroid hormones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' (L5) affects thyroid health primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Producing T3 directly within the distal colon",
                "Regulating the deconjugation of estrogen via beta-glucuronidase, influencing Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG) levels",
                "Increasing the absorption of selenium in the duodenum",
                "Stimulating the pituitary gland to release more FSH and TSH simultaneously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome regulates the recirculation of estrogen. High levels of circulating estrogen increase Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), which binds to thyroid hormones and reduces the amount of 'Free' active hormone available to cells."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which nutrient synergy (L6) is essential for the initial step of thyroid hormone synthesis, specifically serving as a required cofactor for the enzyme Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Iron (as Heme)",
                "Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TPO is a heme-dependent enzyme. Iron deficiency can impair TPO activity, leading to reduced thyroid hormone production even if iodine levels are sufficient."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Mitochondrial Bioenergetics (L7) teaches that T3 regulates thermogenesis primarily by upregulating which protein in brown adipose tissue?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "T3 increases the expression of UCP1 (thermogenin) in mitochondria, which allows protons to leak across the inner membrane, generating heat instead of ATP."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In the BALANCE Method™ (L8), what does the 'L' represent in the clinical integration sequence?",

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A 2017 meta-analysis mentioned in the course demonstrated that Selenium supplementation (L6) in patients with Hashimoto's resulted in what statistical outcome?",
            "options": [
                "A 100% cure rate within 30 days",
                "A significant reduction in TPO antibody titers (approximately 30-50% in some cohorts)",
                "A decrease in TSH but an increase in rT3",
                "No measurable change in any thyroid markers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies and meta-analyses have shown that 200mcg of Selenium (as selenomethionine) can significantly reduce TPO antibodies over a 3-12 month period."

            "question": "Case Study Application: A client presents with 'normal' TSH (2.1 mIU/L) but low basal body temperature (97.2°F) and high rT3. Which 'Leg' of the Three-Legged Stool (L2) should be investigated first if they also report chronic bloating and food sensitivities?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic testing for HLA-DQ2/8",
                "Environmental triggers (heavy metals)",
                "Intestinal Permeability (Gut Barrier Function)",
                "Increasing Iodine dosage immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The presentation of bloating and food sensitivities suggests the 'Intestinal Permeability' leg of the stool is active, which can drive the inflammation causing high rT3."
