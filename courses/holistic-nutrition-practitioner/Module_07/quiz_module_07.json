            "question": "In the 'Endocrine Symphony,' how does chronic HPA axis activation typically affect the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of TSH, leading to hyperthyroidism.",
                "High cortisol inhibits the conversion of T4 to active T3 and increases production of Reverse T3 (rT3).",
                "It has no measurable effect on thyroid function as the axes operate independently.",
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors in peripheral tissues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol inhibit the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3. Instead, the body shifts toward producing Reverse T3, an inactive isomer that blocks T3 receptors."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' energy patterns, mid-section weight gain, and salt cravings. Which stage of HPA axis dysfunction is most likely according to the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) model?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1: Hyper-cortisolism (Alarm Phase)",
                "Stage 2: Resistance/Adaptive Phase",
                "Stage 3: HPA Axis Exhaustion",
                "Acute Stress Response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage 2 (Resistance) is characterized by erratic cortisol levels, often high at night (wired) but struggling during the day (tired), leading to the specific symptoms of weight gain and electrolyte imbalances (salt cravings)."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Functional medicine practitioners often consider a TSH level 'optimal' when it falls within which range, despite standard lab ranges being broader?",
            "options": [
                "0.1 - 1.0 uIU/mL",
                "4.5 - 10.0 uIU/mL",
                "2.5 - 5.5 uIU/mL",
                "1.0 - 2.5 uIU/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While standard labs may allow TSH up to 4.5 or 5.0 uIU/mL, the functional 'optimal' range for most healthy individuals is typically 1.0 to 2.5 uIU/mL for peak metabolic and hormonal health."

            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which Hyperinsulinemia contributes to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin stimulates the theca cells of the ovaries to produce excess androgens.",
                "Insulin increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), locking up testosterone.",
                "Insulin suppresses the release of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) from the pituitary.",
                "Insulin converts progesterone into estrogen via the aromatase enzyme."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate ovarian theca cells to produce androgens. Additionally, high insulin lowers SHBG, which increases the amount of free, active testosterone in the blood."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which nutritional intervention is most effective for supporting Phase I and Phase II liver detoxification of 'dirty' estrogens (16-OH and 4-OH hydroxyestrone)?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose Vitamin C and citrus bioflavonoids",
                "Increased consumption of cruciferous vegetables containing Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) and Sulforaphane",
                "A low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to reduce bile production",
                "Supplementing with isolated soy isoflavones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cruciferous vegetables contain I3C (which converts to DIM) and sulforaphane, which promote the 2-OH pathway (the 'protective' pathway) of estrogen metabolism and support Phase II glucuronidation."

            "question": "According to circadian rhythm biology, exposure to blue light (450-480nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin by stimulating which specific part of the brain?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)",
                "The Medulla Oblongata",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN in the hypothalamus is the body's master clock. It receives light signals from the retina and signals the pineal gland to inhibit melatonin production when blue light is detected."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Xenoestrogen' effect of environmental toxins like Bisphenol A (BPA)?",
            "options": [
                "They destroy estrogen receptors entirely.",
                "They act as 'endocrine mimics' that bind to estrogen receptors, often triggering a stronger or distorted response.",
                "They prevent the thyroid from absorbing iodine.",
                "They increase the production of progesterone to counter estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are chemical compounds that structurally mimic endogenous estrogen. They bind to estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta) and can disrupt the delicate hormonal balance, often contributing to estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In a client with suspected 'Estrogen Dominance,' why is adequate dietary fiber intake (25-35g/day) considered a priority intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Fiber binds to conjugated estrogens in the digestive tract, preventing their reabsorption via the enterohepatic circulation.",
                "Fiber increases the production of cortisol, which balances estrogen.",
                "Fiber inhibits the production of all steroid hormones.",
                "Fiber is a direct precursor to progesterone synthesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Once the liver conjugates estrogen for excretion, it enters the gut. If a client is constipated or lacks fiber, the enzyme beta-glucuronidase can 'de-conjugate' the estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream."

            "question": "A 2021 study on 'Metabolic Flexibility' indicated that a 12-hour overnight fast (Time-Restricted Feeding) primarily benefits hormonal health by:",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing cortisol spikes at midnight.",
                "Decreasing insulin sensitivity and increasing IGF-1.",

                "Eliminating the need for thyroid hormone production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Time-restricted feeding helps reset leptin and insulin signaling, which are critical for overall endocrine balance, while reducing inflammatory markers that otherwise disrupt the HPA axis."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is a critical cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, protecting the thyroid gland from oxidative stress during the production of T4?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Selenium",
                "Vitamin K2",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for glutathione peroxidase, which neutralizes hydrogen peroxide produced during iodine attachment to thyroglobulin. It is also a key component of the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 to T3."
