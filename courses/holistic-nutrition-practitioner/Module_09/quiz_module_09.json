            "question": "According to the neurobiology of habit formation, which part of the brain is primarily responsible for the automation of routines, effectively shifting control away from the prefrontal cortex?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The basal ganglia, specifically the striatum, plays a key role in habit formation. As a behavior becomes repetitive, the prefrontal cortex (responsible for executive decision-making) 'powers down,' and the basal ganglia takes over to execute the routine automatically."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In Motivational Interviewing (MI), the acronym OARS represents the core communication skills. What does the 'R' stand for in this evidence-based framework?",

                "Resistance Management",
                "Rationalization",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "OARS stands for Open-ended questions, Affirmations, Reflective listening, and Summaries. Reflective listening is critical for demonstrating empathy and helping the client hear their own 'change talk' reflected back to them."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A 2010 study by Lally et al. published in the European Journal of Social Psychology found that the average time for a new behavior to become an automatic habit was approximately how many days?",
            "options": [
                "21 days",
                "45 days",

                "120 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the 21-day myth is common, Lally et al. (2010) found that it takes an average of 66 days for a behavior to reach peak automaticity, with a range of 18 to 254 days depending on complexity."

                "After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit].",
                "Before [New Habit], I will [Current Habit].",

                "If [New Habit] happens, then I will [Reward]."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking uses the 'After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]' formula. This uses an established neural pathway (the anchor) to trigger the initiation of the new behavior."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short-wavelength blue light is detected by melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells, which signal the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to suppress melatonin production, disrupting sleep onset and quality."

            "options": [
                "Up to 200 calories",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nudges are subtle changes in the environment that make the desired behavior the 'path of least resistance' or the default choice without forbidding any options. Placing healthy food at eye-level is a classic nudge."

            "id": "q9_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustain Talk consists of the client's arguments for maintaining the status quo or reasons why they cannot change. The practitioner's goal is to minimize sustain talk and evoke more change talk."

            "options": [
                "Increased cortisol production",
                "Downregulation of thyroid hormones",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction triggers the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface, allowing glucose to enter the cell independently of insulin, which significantly improves metabolic health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on who you wish to become (the type of person) rather than the outcome you want to achieve. This shift in self-perception is more sustainable than outcome-oriented goals."
