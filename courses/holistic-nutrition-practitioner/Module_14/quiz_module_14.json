            "question": "When defining an Ideal Client Avatar (ICA), why is 'Psychographic' data considered superior to 'Demographic' data for conversion?",
            "options": [
                "Demographics only cover age and location, while psychographics identify the specific emotional pain points and internal motivations that drive a purchase decision.",
                "Psychographics allow for easier targeting on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram compared to age-based targeting.",
                "Demographic data is no longer legally allowed to be used in marketing under modern GDPR and HIPAA regulations.",
                "Psychographic data provides the exact income level of the client, ensuring they can afford premium $2,000+ packages."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While demographics provide the 'who,' psychographics provide the 'why.' Understanding a client's fears, values, and barriers allows a practitioner to speak directly to their internal experience, which is the primary driver of high-ticket health coaching conversions."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Anchor Effect' is discussed regarding pricing. How should a practitioner utilize this when presenting service packages?",
            "options": [
                "Present the lowest-priced option first to build trust before showing the expensive packages.",
                "Present the highest-priced 'Premium' package first to set a value benchmark, making the mid-tier 'Standard' package appear more affordable.",
                "Always offer a discount within the first 5 minutes of a call to anchor the client's perception of a 'good deal.'",
                "Keep all prices hidden until the very end of a 6-month program to avoid scaring the client away."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Price anchoring is a cognitive bias where the first piece of information offered (the 'anchor') is used to make subsequent judgments. By presenting a high-value premium package first, the mid-tier options seem like a significantly better value by comparison."

            "question": "According to Digital Marketing foundations, what is the primary purpose of a 'Lead Magnet' in a nutrition practice?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a complete 30-day meal plan so the client doesn't need to hire you.",
                "To sell a low-ticket $27 product immediately upon sign-up.",
                "To exchange high-value information for an email address, moving a 'cold' lead into an 'owned' audience for further nurturing.",
                "To improve the SEO ranking of the website by increasing the time spent on the homepage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A lead magnet is a top-of-funnel tool designed to capture contact information. This allows the practitioner to nurture the relationship through email marketing, which has a significantly higher ROI than social media posting alone."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which legal document is most critical for protecting a Holistic Nutritionist from 'Unauthorized Practice of Medicine' claims?",
            "options": [
                "A HIPAA Privacy Notice.",
                "A Professional Liability Insurance Certificate.",
                "A Scope of Practice Disclaimer and Informed Consent form.",
                "A Website Terms and Conditions page."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Scope of Practice Disclaimer explicitly states that the practitioner is not a doctor, does not diagnose or treat disease, and that their advice is for educational and nutritional support only. This is the primary defense against legal claims of practicing medicine without a license."

            "options": [
                "The time difference between the client's time zone and the practitioner's office.",
                "The distance between the client's current health state and their desired health goals.",
                "The financial deficit in the practitioner's monthly budget that this client needs to fill.",
                "The missing nutrients in the client's current diet revealed during the 3-day food log."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' is the distance between where the client is now (pain) and where they want to be (pleasure). The practitioner's role in the discovery call is to demonstrate that their program is the 'bridge' that crosses that gap."

                "Over 200%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data shows that increasing retention by just 5% can boost profits by 25% to 95%. This is because the cost of acquiring a new client is significantly higher than the cost of keeping an existing one, and loyal clients tend to buy more over time."

            "options": [
                "Group programs require no time from the practitioner, while passive products require weekly calls.",
                "Group programs leverage '1-to-many' time delivery, whereas passive products require no live delivery once the asset is created.",
                "Passive income products are always more expensive than group programs.",
                "There is no difference; both terms are used interchangeably in nutrition business models."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scalable models like group coaching still require some active time (the '1-to-many' delivery), whereas passive income involves selling pre-recorded courses or ebooks that generate revenue without any direct time exchange from the practitioner."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In the 'Profit First' financial model, what is the recommended action when a practitioner receives a payment from a client?",

                "Pay all business expenses first, then take what is left as personal pay.",
                "Immediately allocate specific percentages to separate accounts for Profit, Owner's Pay, Taxes, and Operating Expenses.",
                "Reinvest 100% of the revenue back into advertising to ensure rapid growth.",
                "Keep all money in one checking account to simplify the bookkeeping process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Profit First methodology flips the traditional formula (Sales - Expenses = Profit) to (Sales - Profit = Expenses). By allocating profit and pay first, the practitioner ensures the business is sustainable and they are compensated for their work."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A practitioner has 1,000 email subscribers and a 2% conversion rate for their $500 'Gut Health Reset.' What is the total projected revenue?",

                "$20,000"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "1,000 subscribers x 0.02 (2%) = 20 clients. 20 clients x $500 = $10,000. Understanding these metrics is vital for financial forecasting in a nutrition practice."

                "It is a requirement for getting organic search traffic to your client portal.",

                "It is the only format accepted by health insurance companies for holistic nutrition reimbursement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SOAP notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) are the industry standard for healthcare documentation. They ensure that the practitioner tracks client progress accurately, which leads to better results (retention) and provides a clear audit trail (legal protection)."
