    {
      "letter": "N",
      "meaning": "Nutrient Density & Bioavailability",
      "description": "This principle focuses on maximizing the concentration of micronutrients, phytonutrients, and essential co-factors in every calorie consumed. Practitioners evaluate not just what a client eats, but their physiological ability to break down and absorb those nutrients through optimized digestive function."

    {
      "letter": "O",
      "meaning": "Oxidative Stress Management",
      "description": "Practitioners identify and mitigate the dietary and environmental triggers that lead to systemic inflammation and cellular damage. By balancing antioxidant intake with pro-oxidant exposure, this step creates a physiological environment conducive to healing and longevity."

    {
      "letter": "U",
      "meaning": "Underpinning Root Causes",
      "description": "This core tenet shifts the focus from superficial symptom management to identifying the fundamental physiological imbalances at the source. It involves a deep dive into a client\u2019s health history, genetics, and lifestyle to understand the 'why' behind their current health status."

    {
      "letter": "R",
      "meaning": "Restorative Gut Integrity",
      "description": "Recognizing the microbiome as the foundation of systemic health, this step prioritizes the repair of the intestinal barrier and the diversification of gut flora. Restoring gut health is treated as a non-negotiable prerequisite for resolving immune, hormonal, and metabolic dysfunction."

    {
      "letter": "I",
      "meaning": "Individualized Biochemistry",
      "description": "This principle rejects 'one-size-fits-all' protocols in favor of interventions tailored to a client\u2019s unique metabolic phenotype and genetic predispositions. It ensures that nutritional recommendations are precisely aligned with the specific biochemical requirements of the individual's body."
    },
    {
      "letter": "S",
      "meaning": "Sustainable Lifestyle Integration",
