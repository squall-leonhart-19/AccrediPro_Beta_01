            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "According to the 2017 study by Konijeti et al. on the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, what percentage of participants achieved clinical remission by week 6?",
            "options": ["45%", "62%", "73%", "88%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that 73% of participants achieved clinical remission by week 6 of the AIP diet, highlighting its efficacy in modulating immune-mediated gut inflammation."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the context of neuroinflammation, what is the primary consequence of microglia 'priming'?",
            "options": ["Increased production of anti-inflammatory IL-10", "An exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory response to subsequent stimuli", "Rapid repair of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)", "Enhanced clearance of amyloid-beta plaques without collateral damage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Primed microglia remain in a hypersensitive state; when a secondary trigger occurs, they release excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to chronic neurodegeneration."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When assessing cardiovascular risk, why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) considered a more accurate marker than LDL-C?",
            "options": ["ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles, regardless of cholesterol volume", "ApoB only measures HDL particles, which are protective", "ApoB levels fluctuate less after a high-fat meal", "LDL-C is often falsely elevated by high vitamin D intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Since each atherogenic particle (VLDL, IDL, LDL) contains exactly one molecule of ApoB, it provides a direct count of the particles that can enter the arterial wall, whereas LDL-C only measures the mass of cholesterol within those particles."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 3.8. Based on metabolic health standards, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": ["Optimal insulin sensitivity", "Early signs of insulin resistance", "Significant insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction", "Type 1 Diabetes mellitus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance. A score of 3.8 reflects a high degree of metabolic dysfunction."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Which enzyme is primarily responsible for the extracellular breakdown of histamine in the digestive tract, and what is a common cofactor for its function?",
            "options": ["HNMT; Vitamin B12", "DAO; Vitamin B6 and Copper", "MAO; Magnesium", "COMT; S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diamine Oxidase (DAO) is the primary enzyme for degrading ingested histamine in the gut. It requires Vitamin B6 and Copper as essential cofactors for catalytic activity."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Naviaux's 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR) theory suggests that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is characterized by:",
            "options": ["A permanent loss of mitochondrial DNA", "Cells remaining stuck in a metabolic state of defense rather than growth", "Excessive ATP production leading to oxidative stress", "An overactive thyroid gland causing 'burnout'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CDR is a programmed evolutionary response where mitochondria shift from energy production to cellular defense. In CFS, the cells fail to exit this cycle, leading to chronic low energy and systemic symptoms."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In nutritional oncology, the 'Warburg Effect' refers to a cancer cell's preference for which metabolic process even in the presence of oxygen?",
            "options": ["Beta-oxidation of fatty acids", "Aerobic glycolysis", "Ketogenesis", "The Pentose Phosphate Pathway"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Warburg Effect describes how cancer cells predominantly use glycolysis to produce energy (and biomass) even when oxygen is available, rather than the more efficient oxidative phosphorylation used by healthy cells."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "When managing a complex case with multiple comorbidities (e.g., SIBO, Hashimoto's, and Mold Toxicity), what is the generally recommended 'Order of Operations' for layering interventions?",
            "options": ["Address hormones first to provide energy for gut healing", "Prioritize the 'upstream' toxic load and gut barrier before fine-tuning hormones", "Start with high-intensity exercise to stimulate the immune system", "Treat all conditions simultaneously with a broad-spectrum supplement protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex case management, practitioners should prioritize 'bottlenecks' like gut permeability and toxic load (drainage/detox) to reduce systemic inflammation before addressing the endocrine system (hormones)."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Which mechanism describes an autoimmune trigger where a foreign pathogen shares structural similarities with self-tissue, causing the immune system to attack both?",
            "options": ["Bystander Activation", "Epitope Spreading", "Molecular Mimicry", "Polyclonal Activation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the amino acid sequence of a pathogen (like gluten or certain bacteria) resembles human tissue (like the thyroid), leading to cross-reactive autoantibodies."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) experiences a 'flare' after eating leftover slow-cooked beef. What is the most likely biochemical reason?",
            "options": ["High lectin content in the beef", "Increased histamine levels due to microbial fermentation during the slow-cooking and storage process", "A sudden spike in blood glucose from the protein", "Low stomach acid preventing protein breakdown"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow-cooking and storing leftovers allow for significant histamine accumulation via microbial decarboxylation of histidine, which can overwhelm the 'histamine bucket' in MCAS/histamine-intolerant individuals."
