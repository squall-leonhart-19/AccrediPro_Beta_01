            "question": "According to the 'Evolution of Nutrition' lesson, what is the primary limitation of the traditional Caloric Theory (CICO) compared to the Holistic Vitality model?",
            "options": [
                "Caloric theory is mathematically incorrect regarding energy expenditure.",
                "It fails to account for the biochemical signaling and hormonal response triggered by different nutrient qualities.",
                "It overemphasizes the role of micronutrients over macronutrients.",
                "It is only applicable to athletes and not the general population."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While calories represent energy, the Holistic Vitality model recognizes that food acts as information, signaling hormonal responses (like insulin and leptin) that dictate metabolic health beyond simple energy balance."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the NOURISH Method™ framework, what does the 'I' represent, and why is it critical for long-term success?",
            "options": [
                "Intervention; focusing on high-dose supplementation.",
                "Isolation; removing the client from toxic environments.",
                "Integration; weaving nutritional changes into the client's existing lifestyle and identity.",
                "Inflammation; the primary biomarker used to track all progress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration ensures that nutritional protocols are not just temporary 'diets' but are successfully incorporated into the client's daily habits and psychological identity for sustainable results."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Allopathic' approach to a symptom like chronic acid reflux?",
            "options": [
                "Investigating low stomach acid and zinc deficiency as root causes.",

                "Rebalancing the gut microbiome through fermented foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Allopathic model typically focuses on symptom suppression (using medication to stop the symptom) rather than investigating the underlying physiological dysfunction (root cause)."

                "Providing a meal plan designed to support healthy blood sugar levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must never diagnose, treat, or alter prescribed medical treatments or dosages. Adjusting medication like insulin is a clinical act reserved for licensed medical doctors."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Nutrigenomics.' What is the core principle of this field regarding DNA?",

                "DNA is a fixed blueprint that determines all health outcomes regardless of diet.",
                "Nutrients act as chemical signals that can 'flip switches' on genes, influencing their expression.",
                "You must have a full genetic sequence before recommending any nutritional intervention.",
                "Nutrition can physically change the sequence of your nucleotides (A, T, C, G)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrigenomics studies how bioactive compounds in food communicate with the genome to upregulate or downregulate gene expression, proving that lifestyle can influence genetic predisposition."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Hierarchy of Health,' which physiological system should generally be prioritized first in a holistic protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Hormonal balancing (Estrogen/Progesterone).",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digestion and Blood Sugar are foundational. If a client cannot absorb nutrients or has unstable blood sugar, higher-level issues like hormone balance or detoxification cannot be effectively addressed."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "In the 'Psychology of Change' lesson, why is 'Information' alone considered insufficient for client transformation?",

                "Most clients are not intelligent enough to understand the science.",
                "The 'Information-Action Gap' is caused by emotional triggers, habits, and neurological pathways that resist change.",
                "Information is usually outdated by the time it reaches the client.",
                "Clients prefer to be told exactly what to do rather than learning why."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Behavior is driven by the limbic system and subconscious habits. Simply providing data (the 'what') does not address the psychological resistance or environmental cues (the 'why' and 'how') that prevent action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "The Case Study in Lesson 8 demonstrated that a client's 'unexplained' fatigue was actually linked to which holistic finding?",
            "options": [
                "A rare genetic disorder that required pharmaceutical intervention.",
                "Subclinical nutrient deficiencies and circadian rhythm disruption that standard labs ignored.",
                "A lack of willpower and failure to follow a high-calorie diet.",
                "Over-hydration leading to electrolyte imbalance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that while 'standard' labs may appear normal, holistic analysis often reveals subclinical imbalances in nutrients and lifestyle factors like light exposure that drain cellular energy."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "What statistic was cited regarding the impact of lifestyle on chronic disease expression (epigenetics)?",
            "options": [
                "Only 5% of chronic disease is purely genetic; the remaining 95% is influenced by environment and lifestyle.",
                "Chronic disease is 50% genetic and 50% lifestyle-based.",
                "Lifestyle has no impact on the expression of autoimmune conditions.",
                "80% of people will develop a chronic disease regardless of their diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research in epigenetics suggests that for the vast majority of chronic conditions, genetics only provide the 'template,' while lifestyle and environment (the 'epigenome') determine whether those genes are expressed."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "When a client presents with 'Red Flag' symptoms like sudden, unexplained weight loss or severe localized pain, what is the practitioner's ethical obligation?",

                "Suggest a restrictive elimination diet to see if the pain subsides.",
                "Recommend a high-potency multivitamin to prevent further weight loss.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed medical professional for diagnostic screening.",
                "Research the symptoms online and provide a tentative holistic diagnosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical boundaries require practitioners to recognize 'Red Flags' that fall outside their scope and ensure the client receives medical clearance before or alongside nutritional support."
