            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Pathological Ranges' used in conventional medicine and 'Functional Ranges' used in Holistic Nutrition?",
            "options": [
                "Pathological ranges are based on the top 10% of the healthiest population.",
                "Functional ranges are narrower and identify shifts in physiology before disease manifests.",
                "Functional ranges are wider to account for bio-individuality and genetic SNPs.",
                "Pathological ranges are used to optimize performance, while functional ranges diagnose disease."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges are tighter than standard laboratory reference ranges. While conventional ranges (pathological) are designed to identify existing disease (usually +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean), functional ranges aim to identify sub-clinical imbalances and physiological dysfunction."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the Functional Medicine Matrix, 'Antecedents' are defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The immediate events that provoked the onset of symptoms.",
                "Factors that contribute to the persistence of a condition or symptom.",
                "Predefined genetic, environmental, or lifestyle factors that predispose an individual to illness.",
                "The specific laboratory markers that indicate a state of systemic inflammation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antecedents are the 'pre-disposers'—factors like genetics, family history, or early childhood environment that set the stage for later health issues, distinct from triggers (onset) and mediators (persistence)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "When mapping symptoms, a client presenting with brain fog, bloating, and joint pain likely demonstrates which physiological pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Isolated neurological dysfunction.",
                "The Gut-Immune-Brain axis connection, where intestinal permeability triggers systemic inflammation.",
                "Primary musculoskeletal degradation due to age-related sarcopenia.",
                "Acute toxicity from heavy metal exposure alone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pattern recognition involves seeing how symptoms in different systems are linked. Brain fog (neurological), bloating (digestive), and joint pain (immune/inflammatory) frequently point to intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') causing systemic immune activation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A 2022 study on clinical assessment accuracy found that a comprehensive health history intake can identify up to what percentage of potential root causes before laboratory testing is even conducted?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25-30%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Greater than 70%",
                "Less than 15%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that a thorough, timeline-based health history intake is the most powerful diagnostic tool, identifying the majority (70%+) of root causes by uncovering the sequence of antecedents, triggers, and mediators."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Hidden Biological Stressor' that frequently goes undetected in standard physical exams?",
            "options": [
                "A fractured radius.",
                "Subclinical chronic viral load (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus reactivation).",
                "High caloric intake.",
                "Visible skin rashes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hidden stressors are internal imbalances that the client may not feel directly as 'pain.' Subclinical infections, gut dysbiosis, and HPA-axis dysfunction are classic biological stressors that drive the allostatic load."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Regarding Epigenetics, what does the '10/90 Rule' generally suggest in the context of chronic disease?",
            "options": [
                "10% of people have good genes, while 90% have 'thrifty' genes.",
                "Only 10% of chronic disease risk is purely genetic, while 90% is determined by environmental and lifestyle factors.",
                "10% of supplements work for 90% of the population.",
                "It takes 10 weeks to change 90% of a client's genetic expression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The emerging consensus in epigenetics is that while genes load the gun, environment pulls the trigger. For most chronic conditions, genetic predisposition accounts for only about 10%, with the remaining 90% driven by the exposome (lifestyle, diet, toxins)."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "According to the prioritization hierarchy in Clinical Decision Making, which intervention should typically be addressed FIRST?",
            "options": [
                "Expensive genetic testing to identify rare SNPs.",
                "High-dose antioxidant therapy to quench free radicals.",
                "Removing significant triggers (e.g., inflammatory foods or environmental toxins) and supporting digestion.",
                "Prescribing targeted botanical protocols for hormonal balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective clinical decision-making follows an 'order of operations.' We must first 'remove' what is causing harm (triggers) and support the 'foundations' (digestion/absorption) before moving to advanced supplementation or hormonal modulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Client Sarah' (42yo, fatigue and weight gain), her TSH was 3.2 mIU/L. Why would a Holistic Practitioner investigate further despite this being within the 'normal' lab range (0.5–4.5)?",
            "options": [
                "Because any TSH above 1.0 is a sign of end-stage thyroid failure.",
                "Because the functional range for TSH is typically 1.0–2.0 mIU/L, and 3.2 may indicate subclinical hypofunction.",
                "Because TSH is an irrelevant marker for thyroid health.",
                "Because the practitioner should always ignore lab results in favor of intuition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 3.2 is 'normal' conventionally, it falls outside the optimal 'functional' range of 1.0–2.0. In the context of Sarah's symptoms (fatigue/weight gain), this 'normal' result is a clinical clue of suboptimal thyroid performance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "What is 'Practitioner Intuition' as defined in the context of data-driven assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Making guesses based on the client's appearance.",
                "The ability to ignore data when it contradicts a personal theory.",
                "The synthesis of clinical experience, observation of non-verbal cues, and objective data to recognize subtle patterns.",
                "A psychic ability to know which supplements a client needs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "True practitioner intuition isn't magic; it is 'expert pattern recognition.' It involves combining objective data (labs/intake) with subjective observations (client's tone, energy, and subtle physical signs) to form a clinical hypothesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which 'Mediator' is most likely to prevent a client from healing despite a perfect diet and supplement protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Occasional consumption of organic fruit.",
                "Chronic perceived emotional stress and a lack of 'safety' in the nervous system.",
                "A single MTHFR heterozygous mutation.",
                "Taking a multivitamin with the wrong form of B12."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mediators are factors that keep a condition going. If a client's nervous system is in a state of 'chronic perceived threat' (sympathetic dominance), the body prioritizes survival over repair, effectively stalling the healing process regardless of nutritional inputs."
