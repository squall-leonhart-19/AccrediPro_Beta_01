            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is often called the 'Second Brain' because it can operate independently of the CNS. Approximately what percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly 95% of the body's serotonin is produced by enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract, where it regulates intestinal movements and signaling."
