            "question": "According to the Nutrient Density Index (ANDI), which specific food category typically achieves the maximum score of 1,000 based on micronutrients per calorie?",
            "options": [
                "Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower",
                "Dark leafy greens like kale, chard, and spinach",
                "Low-glycemic fruits like blueberries and raspberries",
                "Organ meats like beef liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Aggregate Nutrient Density Index (ANDI) ranks food based on micronutrients per calorie. Dark leafy greens like kale and spinach consistently score a perfect 1,000, whereas organ meats, though nutrient-dense by weight, have lower scores due to their higher caloric density."

            "question": "Phytic acid (phytates) found in grains and legumes is considered an 'antinutrient' primarily because it binds to which minerals in the digestive tract?",
            "options": [
                "Sodium and Potassium",
                "Vitamin A and Vitamin K",
                "Zinc, Iron, and Calcium",
                "Vitamin B12 and Folate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phytates are known as 'mineral blockers' because they form insoluble complexes with divalent cations, specifically zinc, iron, calcium, and magnesium, significantly reducing their bioavailability."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client identified as a 'Fast Oxidizer' in Metabolic Typing would likely feel most satiated and energized with which macronutrient profile?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate (70%), low fat (10%), low protein (20%)",
                "High protein (40%), high fat (30%), low glycemic carbohydrates (30%)",
                "Moderate carbohydrate (50%), moderate protein (25%), moderate fat (25%)",
                "Ketogenic ratio: 5% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 75% fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fast oxidizers burn through glucose rapidly. To stabilize energy and prevent blood sugar crashes, they require higher ratios of proteins and fats (heavier fuels) compared to slow oxidizers."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "What is the critical role of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) in the bioavailability of Vitamin B12?",
            "options": [
                "HCl converts B12 into its active form, methylcobalamin",
                "HCl acts as a transport protein to carry B12 into the ileum",
                "HCl is required to activate pepsin, which cleaves B12 from its food-protein carrier",
                "HCl neutralizes the alkaline environment of the stomach to prevent B12 degradation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 is bound to proteins in food. HCl is necessary to activate pepsinogen into pepsin, which then breaks the protein bonds, releasing B12 so it can later bind with Intrinsic Factor for absorption."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Research from the Kushi Institute (1975-1997) highlighted a significant decline in food quality. What was the average recorded drop in Calcium levels across 12 fresh vegetables during this period?",

                "62%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Kushi Institute analysis of USDA data showed an average 27% decline in calcium, a 37% decline in iron, and a 21% decline in Vitamin A in common vegetables due to soil depletion and modern farming."

            "question": "To maximize the bioavailability of curcumin in turmeric, clinical studies suggest it should be consumed with piperine (black pepper). By what percentage can piperine increase curcumin absorption?",
            "options": [
                "50%",
                "200%",
                "500%",
                "2000%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Piperine inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that eliminates curcumin, increasing its bioavailability by up to 2,000%, as demonstrated in human clinical trials."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which food preparation technique is specifically recommended to neutralize heat-stable lectins in legumes that cannot be removed by simple soaking alone?",
            "options": [
                "Dehydration at 115°F",
                "Pressure cooking at high temperatures",
                "Freezing for 48 hours",
                "Lightly steaming for 3-5 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While soaking and sprouting reduce many antinutrients, certain lectins (like Phytohaemagglutinin in kidney beans) are heat-stable and require the high heat and pressure of a pressure cooker to be fully deactivated."

            "question": "The 'Protein Leverage Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 3 suggests that the human body will continue to drive hunger and overconsumption of energy until which requirement is met?",
            "options": [
                "A specific threshold of essential fatty acids",
                "A specific absolute amount of protein",
                "A specific volume of dietary fiber",
                "A specific ratio of micronutrients to calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis posits that humans have a strong biological drive for protein; if the diet is protein-dilute (high in fats/carbs), the body will signal hunger and drive overeating to reach its required protein intake."

            "question": "A client presents with chronic bloating, undigested food in stool, and brittle fingernails. These are classic clinical indicators of which condition affecting bioavailability?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperchlorhydria (Excess stomach acid)",
                "Hypochlorhydria (Low stomach acid)",
                "Excessive intake of insoluble fiber",
                "Bile acid malabsorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypochlorhydria prevents the proper breakdown of proteins and the ionization of minerals. Common signs include undigested food in stool and 'weak' nails due to mineral malabsorption."

            "question": "When consuming cruciferous vegetables, the enzyme myrosinase is required to convert glucoraphanin into the potent phytonutrient sulforaphane. If the vegetable is boiled and the enzyme is destroyed, how can a practitioner suggest the client still obtain sulforaphane?",
            "options": [
                "By adding raw mustard seeds or raw radish to the cooked meal",
                "By consuming the cooking water",
                "By adding extra virgin olive oil to the meal",
                "By fermenting the vegetable after it has been boiled"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Myrosinase is heat-sensitive. If crucifers are cooked, adding a source of raw myrosinase (like ground mustard seeds, daikon radish, or raw arugula) can restore the conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane."
