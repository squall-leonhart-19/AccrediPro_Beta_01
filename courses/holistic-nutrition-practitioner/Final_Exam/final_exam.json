        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "Under the NOURISH Method™, the 'N' (Nutrient Density & Bioavailability) principle emphasizes that nutritional status is not just determined by intake, but by 'physiological ability.' Which physiological factor most directly impacts the bioavailability of divalent minerals like Zinc and Magnesium?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of dietary fiber in the distal colon",
                "Adequate hydrochloric acid (HCl) production for mineral ionization",
                "The rate of gastric emptying in the pyloric sphincter",
                "The concentration of salivary amylase during mastication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydrochloric acid is essential for the ionization of minerals. Without adequate HCl (hypochlorhydria), minerals remain bound to their transport proteins or salts, significantly reducing their bioavailability and absorption in the small intestine."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with systemic inflammation and high levels of 8-OHdG (a marker of DNA damage). According to the 'O' (Oxidative Stress Management) principle, which endogenous pathway should the practitioner aim to upregulate through nutrients like Sulforaphane?",
            "options": [
                "The mTOR pathway for protein synthesis",
                "The Nrf2 signaling pathway for antioxidant response element (ARE) activation",

                "The Krebs cycle for ATP generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Nrf2 pathway is the body's primary defense against oxidative stress. Activating Nrf2 triggers the production of endogenous antioxidants like glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD), which mitigate cellular damage and lower 8-OHdG levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "The 'U' (Underpinning Root Causes) principle shifts focus from symptoms to etiology. If a client presents with 'brain fog,' which root cause mechanism is a practitioner most likely to investigate first within the NOURISH framework?",

                "They have a higher risk of developing Vitamin D toxicity on high-fat diets"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individualized biochemistry recognizes that the APOE4 genotype is associated with altered lipid metabolism and increased cardiovascular/Alzheimer's risk. High saturated fat intake in this population can lead to unfavorable lipid profiles and increased oxidative stress."
