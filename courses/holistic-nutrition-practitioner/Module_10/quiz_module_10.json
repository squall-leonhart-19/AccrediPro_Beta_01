            "question": "Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) posits that the brain and immune system communicate bidirectionally. Which class of signaling molecules is primarily responsible for inducing 'sickness behavior' (anorexia, lethargy, social withdrawal) during an inflammatory response?",
            "options": [
                "Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-alpha)",
                "Catecholamines (e.g., Epinephrine)",
                "Glucocorticoids (e.g., Cortisol)",
                "Immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha act as molecular messengers that signal the brain to initiate sickness behavior, which is an adaptive strategy to conserve energy for the immune response."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to Porges' Polyvagal Theory, which state must the nervous system be in to facilitate optimal 'rest and digest' functions and social engagement?",
            "options": [
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown",
                "Sympathetic Mobilization",
                "Ventral Vagal Stabilization",
                "HPA Axis Hyper-activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is the 'social engagement system' that promotes a state of safety, allowing for optimal digestion, heart rate variability, and social connection."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that chronic psychological stress can reduce the diversity of the gut microbiota. What is the specific term for this stress-induced microbial imbalance?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperpermeability",
                "Stress-induced Dysbiosis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress-induced dysbiosis refers to the alteration of the gut microbial community structure due to chronic activation of the stress response, which affects the gut-brain axis."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Emotional Eating,' what is the primary physiological marker that distinguishes physical hunger from emotional hunger?",
            "options": [
                "Physical hunger is felt in the chest, while emotional hunger is in the throat.",
                "Physical hunger develops gradually and is satisfied by any food; emotional hunger is sudden and craving-specific.",
                "Emotional hunger causes a drop in blood glucose, whereas physical hunger does not.",
                "Physical hunger is triggered by ghrelin, whereas emotional hunger is triggered by leptin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physical hunger is a biological need that builds slowly and is flexible regarding food choice. Emotional hunger is often a sudden reaction to a stressor and targets 'highly palatable' foods (high fat/sugar)."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "The 'Cephalic Phase Digestive Response' (CPDR) can account for what percentage of the total digestive response to a meal?",

                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Expert estimates suggest the CPDR (the phase of digestion triggered by the sight, smell, and thought of food) accounts for 30-40% of the total digestive effort, including enzyme secretion and stomach acid production."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Trauma-informed nutrition practitioners must be aware of the 'Window of Tolerance.' If a client becomes 'hypo-aroused' during a session, they are likely experiencing:",
            "options": [
                "Panic, anger, or racing thoughts",
                "Numbness, dissociation, or 'shutting down'",

                "A sudden increase in metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is a state of 'freeze' or collapse where the client may appear distant, numb, or unable to process information, often as a protective mechanism against perceived threat."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "The 2011 'Milkshake Study' by Crum et al. demonstrated that participants' belief about the caloric content of a shake (Sensible vs. Indulgent) directly influenced which hormone, regardless of the actual calories consumed?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin",
                "Glucagon",
                "Ghrelin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study showed that ghrelin (the hunger hormone) dropped significantly more when participants believed they were consuming an 'indulgent' shake, proving that mindset alters physiological satiety markers."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "When integrating breathwork into a nutrition plan, which specific ratio is most effective for stimulating the vagus nerve and lowering postprandial (post-meal) stress?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid, shallow chest breathing",
                "Inhales that are longer than exhales",
                "Exhales that are longer than inhales (e.g., 4-7-8 breathing)",
                "Equal 2-second inhale and 2-second exhale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolonging the exhalation relative to the inhalation activates the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve, which is essential for optimal nutrient absorption."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Mark' reports chronic bloating and acid reflux despite eating a high-fiber, organic diet. He admits to eating while driving and checking stock market updates. Which 'Mindful Eating' concept is most relevant here?",

                "Nutrient Density",
                "Digestive Presence",
                "Glycemic Load",
                "Caloric Restriction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mark lacks 'Digestive Presence.' His sympathetic nervous system is dominant (fight-or-flight), which shunts blood away from the digestive tract, leading to poor enzyme production and bloating regardless of food quality."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "What percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut (the Enteric Nervous System), highlighting the importance of gut health for emotional regulation?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "About 90-95% of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, where it regulates intestinal transit and communicates with the brain via the vagus nerve to influence mood and behavior."
