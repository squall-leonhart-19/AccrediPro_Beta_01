            "question": "In the context of therapeutic dosing, how does the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) differ from the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)?",
            "options": [
                "The RDA is the maximum safe dose, while the UL is the minimum needed to prevent deficiency.",
                "The RDA is designed to meet the needs of 97-98% of healthy individuals to prevent deficiency, while the UL is the highest daily intake unlikely to cause adverse effects.",
                "The RDA is only for children, while the UL is only for adults.",
                "There is no difference; they are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RDA is a baseline for preventing deficiency in healthy populations, whereas the UL marks the threshold beyond which the risk of toxicity or adverse effects increases."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort increases serotonin levels and induces the CYP3A4 enzyme, making it dangerous to combine with SSRIs and many other pharmaceutical medications."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "When recommending high-dose Vitamin D3 (e.g., 5,000 IU+), which co-factor is essential to activate Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) and ensure calcium is directed to the bones rather than the arteries?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin K2 (as MK-7)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 activates MGP, which prevents vascular calcification, and Osteocalcin, which binds calcium to the bone matrix, making it a critical synergy for Vitamin D3."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bitters act on the TAS2R receptors on the tongue to trigger the cephalic phase of digestion, increasing HCl and enzyme production."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of 'burnout,' including morning fatigue and evening 'wired' energy. Which adaptogen is most appropriate for its 'amphoteric' ability to both calm and nourish the HPA axis?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B6 acts as a 'chaperone' for magnesium, helping it cross the cell membrane more efficiently, which is why they are frequently paired in therapeutic formulas."

            "id": "q13_9",

                "Because supplements are more expensive than drugs.",
                "Because practitioners are only allowed to recommend brands they sell.",
                "Because nutritionists cannot 'diagnose, treat, or cure' medical conditions; they must focus on 'supporting structure and function.'",
                "Because Diabetes can only be managed with insulin."
