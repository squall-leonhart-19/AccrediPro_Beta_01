            "question": "A client with a known MTHFR C677T polymorphism is planning a pregnancy. Why is 5-MTHF (Methylfolate) preferred over synthetic folic acid in this case?",
            "options": [
                "Folic acid causes a toxic buildup of homocysteine in the first trimester",
                "Synthetic folic acid requires the MTHFR enzyme for conversion to the active form, which is impaired in this client",
                "5-MTHF is the only form of folate that can cross the placenta to the fetus",
                "Folic acid inhibits the absorption of Vitamin B12, leading to megaloblastic anemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with MTHFR polymorphisms have a reduced ability to convert synthetic folic acid into the active 5-MTHF form. Using the methylated form bypasses this enzymatic bottleneck, ensuring adequate folate for neural tube development."

            "question": "Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) are the third most abundant solid component in breast milk. What is their primary function in pediatric nutrition?",
            "options": [
                "Providing the primary caloric source for infant brain growth",
                "Acting as a direct antimicrobial agent against viral infections",
                "Serving as prebiotics that specifically nourish Bifidobacterium infantis in the gut",
                "Facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HMOs are not digested by the infant; instead, they serve as specialized prebiotics that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium infantis, which is crucial for developing the infant immune system and gut barrier."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "During the adolescent growth spurt, which nutrient requirement increases most significantly in females compared to males to support both lean mass and physiological changes?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Iron",
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to the onset of menstruation and the expansion of blood volume during rapid growth, iron requirements in adolescent females increase to approximately 15mg/day to prevent iron-deficiency anemia."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in aging populations (Sarcopenia prevention), what is the recommended protein distribution strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming 80% of daily protein during the evening meal",
                "A 'protein pulse' of 10g every two hours throughout the day",
                "Consuming 0.4-0.5g/kg of high-quality protein per meal, evenly distributed (approx. 30g per meal)",
                "Restricting protein to 0.6g/kg total per day to reduce kidney strain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Older adults require a higher 'leucine threshold' (approx. 2.5-3g of leucine or ~30g of total protein) per meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis. Even distribution ensures the anabolic switch is flipped multiple times per day."

            "question": "In the context of the 'Pregnenolone Steal,' how does chronic stress contribute to menopausal symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "High cortisol levels increase the excretion of estrogen through the kidneys",
                "The body prioritizes cortisol production over progesterone, exacerbating estrogen dominance",
                "Stress causes the ovaries to prematurely stop all hormone production",
                "Cortisol binds to estrogen receptors, blocking the effects of HRT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pregnenolone is the precursor to both cortisol and sex hormones. Under chronic stress, the body shunts the 'mother hormone' toward cortisol production, leading to lower levels of progesterone and worsening the hormonal imbalances seen in perimenopause."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A vegan athlete is concerned about their intake of Essential Amino Acids (EAAs). Which amino acid is most frequently the 'limiting factor' in grain-based vegan diets?",
            "options": [
                "Arginine",
                "Glutamine",
                "Lysine",
                "Leucine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lysine is typically the limiting amino acid in grains (like wheat and rice). Vegan clients must consume legumes, soy, or quinoa, which are higher in lysine, to ensure a complete amino acid profile."

            "question": "According to the lesson on Weight Loss Resistance, how do 'obesogens' like phthalates and BPA impact metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the number of adipocytes (fat cells) and interfere with leptin signaling",
                "They physically block the absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine",
                "They increase the metabolic rate to unsustainable levels, causing 'burnout'",
                "They prevent the liver from storing glycogen, forcing all sugar into fat cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Obesogens are endocrine disruptors that can increase the size and number of fat cells, alter the basal metabolic rate, and disrupt the hormonal signaling (like leptin and insulin) that regulates hunger and satiety."

            "question": "For an endurance athlete, what is the 'Gold Standard' for glycogen replenishment within the 2-hour post-exercise window?",
            "options": [
                "High-fat, low-carb meal to encourage fat adaptation",

                "Intermittent fasting for 4 hours to maximize growth hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To rapidly restore glycogen stores after intense glycogen-depleting exercise, the recommendation is 1.0 to 1.2 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight per hour for the first four hours of recovery."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, age 52, presents with brain fog, night sweats, and weight gain around the midsection despite no change in diet. Her fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. What is the most likely holistic priority?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric restriction (1,200 calories) to force weight loss",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 6 days a week to boost metabolism",

                "Eliminating all fats to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah is showing signs of insulin resistance (glucose >100) and HPA-axis dysfunction common in menopause. Caloric restriction or excessive HIIT would likely increase cortisol, further worsening her symptoms and weight gain."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which dietary pattern has shown the most significant evidence in meta-analyses for reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MIND diet, which emphasizes leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil while limiting red meat and butter, has been shown in clinical studies to significantly slow cognitive decline and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's by up to 53% in high-adherence groups."
