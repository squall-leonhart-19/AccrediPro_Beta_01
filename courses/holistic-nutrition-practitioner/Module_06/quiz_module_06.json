            "question": "According to the principles of Metabolic Typing, a client classified as a 'Fast Oxidizer' would typically require which macronutrient distribution to prevent rapid glucose depletion and maintain energy?",
            "options": [
                "High carbohydrate (60-70%), low protein, low fat",
                "High protein (40%), high fat (30%), and low-glycemic carbohydrates (30%)",
                "Equal distribution of 33% protein, 33% fat, and 34% carbohydrates",
                "Ultra-low fat (less than 10%) with moderate protein and high complex starch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fast Oxidizers burn through glucose rapidly; they require higher levels of protein and fat to slow down the oxidative rate and provide a more sustained energy release."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "When assessing insulin sensitivity using the HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) calculation, which score is generally considered the threshold for the onset of early-stage insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 1.0",
                "Exactly 1.5",
                "Greater than 1.9",
                "Greater than 3.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'optimal' is often below 1.0, a HOMA-IR score greater than 1.9 indicates the beginning of insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 indicate significant insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "During an Indirect Calorimetry test, a client exhibits a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70 while in a fasted state. What does this value indicate about their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily burning carbohydrates and lacks metabolic flexibility.",
                "The client is in a state of anaerobic glycolysis.",
                "The client is primarily burning fatty acids, indicating good metabolic flexibility in a fasted state.",
                "The client is experiencing 'metabolic gridlock' where neither fuel is being burned efficiently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates 100% fat oxidation, which is the expected and healthy metabolic response during a fasted state, demonstrating the ability to access stored lipids."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client presents with the MTHFR C677T homozygous polymorphism. Based on nutrigenomic principles, which nutritional strategy is most appropriate to support their biochemical individuality?",
            "options": [
                "Supplementing with high-dose synthetic Folic Acid (Pteroylmonoglutamic acid)",
                "Increasing intake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) and riboflavin (B2)",
                "Restricting all leafy green vegetables to avoid methyl donor overload",
                "Focusing exclusively on Vitamin C to reduce oxidative stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The C677T variant reduces the enzyme's ability to process folate; 5-MTHF provides the active form, while Riboflavin is a necessary cofactor for the MTHFR enzyme."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which amino acid serves as the primary precursor for the synthesis of serotonin, and which cofactor is mandatory for its initial conversion via the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase?",
            "options": [
                "Tyrosine; Vitamin B6",
                "L-Phenylalanine; Iron",

                "Glutamine; Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan is the precursor to serotonin. The rate-limiting step involves tryptophan hydroxylase, which requires Iron and BH4 as cofactors."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In the synthesis of anti-inflammatory Series 1 Prostaglandins (PGE1), which enzyme is considered the 'rate-limiting step' and is frequently inhibited by high trans-fat intake and elevated insulin?",
            "options": [
                "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)",
                "Delta-6 Desaturase (D6D)",

                "Delta-5 Desaturase (D5D)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Delta-6 Desaturase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of Linoleic Acid to GLA (and eventually PGE1). Its activity is hindered by stress, aging, and poor diet."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) for a 'Carbohydrate Tolerance Test,' a practitioner observes that a client's blood glucose rises from 90 mg/dL to 165 mg/dL after consuming 50g of complex carbohydrates. This 75 mg/dL 'delta' suggests:",

                "Normal physiological response to starch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In healthy individuals, postprandial glucose should ideally not rise more than 30-40 mg/dL from baseline. A rise of 75 mg/dL indicates significant glucose intolerance."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In the Case Study of 'Client David' (Lesson 8), a high-protein/high-fat 'Paleo' diet caused fatigue and brain fog. This was biochemically attributed to his status as a 'Parasympathetic Dominant' type. What was the corrective intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing red meat and saturated fat intake",

                "Starting a 3-day water fast to reset insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parasympathetic types (often 'Carbo Types') thrive on higher carbohydrate ratios to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and balance their naturally slower oxidative rate."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "The 'FTO' gene variant is frequently discussed in nutrigenomics. A client with the 'AA' high-risk genotype is statistically more likely to struggle with which biochemical challenge?",

                "Extreme sensitivity to caffeine metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTO (Fat Mass and Obesity-associated) gene influences the hypothalamus, affecting ghrelin levels and reducing post-meal satiety, making portion control biologically more difficult."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Which intracellular 'energy sensor' is activated during exercise or fasting to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and the shift toward fatty acid oxidation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AMPK acts as the 'metabolic master switch' that senses low energy (high AMP:ATP ratio) and triggers pathways that increase energy production, such as fat burning and mitochondrial repair."
