            "question": "According to the Two-Process Model of Sleep Regulation discussed in Lesson 1, what happens to 'Process S' the longer an individual remains awake?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases, leading to higher levels of alertness",
                "It increases, creating a higher homeostatic sleep pressure",
                "It remains static until the circadian rhythm (Process C) peaks",
                "It fluctuates in 90-minute ultradian cycles regardless of wake time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Process S (the homeostatic sleep drive) builds up progressively during wakefulness. The longer a client stays awake, the greater the pressure to sleep becomes."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "A client spends 9 hours in bed but only sleeps for 6 hours. Based on Lesson 3, what is their Sleep Efficiency (SE) and is it considered optimal?",
            "options": [
                "66.6%; No, optimal SE is generally above 85%",
                "75%; No, optimal SE is generally above 90%",
                "66.6%; Yes, as long as they feel rested",
                "54%; No, optimal SE is generally above 80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated as (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) x 100. 6/9 = 66.6%. In Sleep Restriction Therapy, the goal is typically to reach an SE of 85-90% before increasing time in bed."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In Stimulus Control Therapy (Lesson 2), what is the primary physiological goal of the '20-minute rule' (leaving the bed if unable to sleep)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the homeostatic sleep drive through physical activity",
                "To prevent the bed from becoming a conditioned stimulus for frustration and wakefulness",
                "To allow the core body temperature to drop more rapidly in a different room",
                "To ensure the client reaches the REM stage of sleep more quickly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control aims to re-establish the association between the bed and sleep. By leaving the bed when awake and frustrated, the client avoids 're-wiring' the bed as a place of anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "When implementing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT), what is the absolute minimum 'Time in Bed' (TIB) window usually recommended for safety?",
            "options": [
                "4 hours",
                "6 hours",
                "5 hours",
                "5.5 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To ensure safety and prevent extreme sleep deprivation, most protocols (including those discussed in Lesson 3) do not restrict Time in Bed to less than 5 hours per night."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "A client states: 'If I don't get exactly 8 hours of sleep tonight, I will definitely fail my presentation tomorrow and lose my job.' Which cognitive distortion from Lesson 4 is this?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Reasoning",
                "Labeling",
                "Catastrophizing",
                "Personalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Catastrophizing involves magnifying the negative consequences of a lack of sleep into a total disaster, which increases the anxiety that prevents sleep."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "How does Autogenic Training (Lesson 5) differ from Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)?",
            "options": [
                "PMR uses biofeedback devices, while Autogenic Training uses herbal supplements",
                "PMR involves physical tension and release, while Autogenic Training uses self-directed mental suggestions of heaviness and warmth",
                "Autogenic Training is only performed in the morning, while PMR is for nighttime only",
                "There is no difference; they are two names for the same technique"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMR is a physical technique of tensing and relaxing muscle groups. Autogenic Training is a form of self-hypnosis/meditation focusing on physiological sensations like limb heaviness and warmth."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the ACT-I approach (Lesson 6), what is the 'struggle switch'?",
            "options": [
                "A physical device used in biofeedback to measure skin conductance",
                "The mental effort used to try and force sleep to happen, which usually results in more wakefulness",
                "The circadian switch located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus",
                "A technique for waking up at the same time every morning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), the struggle switch refers to the internal battle against unpleasant thoughts or wakefulness. Turning it 'off' means accepting the current state without trying to force a change, which ironically reduces the arousal preventing sleep."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "During the DREAM Synthesis (Lesson 7), the '90-Day Mastery Roadmap' emphasizes which of the following in the final 30 days?",
            "options": [
                "Strict adherence to 5-hour sleep windows",
                "Relapse prevention and transitioning from 'rules' to 'flexible rituals'",
                "Starting pharmacological interventions to maintain gains",
                "Eliminating all caffeine intake permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The final stage of the 90-day roadmap focuses on sustainability, mastery, and relapse prevention, moving the client toward a natural, flexible relationship with sleep."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Professional Practice, which of the following symptoms requires an immediate referral to a medical professional?",
            "options": [
                "Occasional difficulty falling asleep due to work stress",
                "A client feeling 'tired but wired' after a long day",
                "Loud snoring accompanied by observed gasping or choking sounds during sleep",
                "A preference for sleeping in a cold room (65°F)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Snoring combined with gasping or choking is a primary indicator of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a medical condition that falls outside the scope of coaching and requires clinical diagnosis."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module compared CBT-I components (like SRT and Stimulus Control) to sedative-hypnotic medications. What was a key finding?",
            "options": [
                "Medications were more effective for long-term maintenance (over 1 year)",
                "CBT-I components produced similar or superior results to medication with better long-term sustainability",
                "Neither intervention was effective for chronic insomnia",
                "Medication and coaching should never be used in the same client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that behavioral interventions (CBT-I components) provide long-lasting results and are often more effective than medications for chronic insomnia without the side effects."
