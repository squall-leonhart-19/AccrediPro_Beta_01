            "question": "Most consumer-grade wearables utilize Photoplethysmography (PPG) to track heart metrics. What is the primary physiological mechanism this technology measures?",
            "options": [
                "Electrical impulses from the sinoatrial node",
                "Changes in light absorption caused by blood volume pulses",
                "Acoustic vibrations of the heart valves closing",
                "Skin conductance changes related to sweat gland activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PPG sensors use green or infrared light to detect blood volume changes in the microvasculature. As the heart beats, a pressure wave changes the volume of blood in the tissue, which alters the amount of light reflected back to the sensor."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "When analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) for recovery, which time-domain metric is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing parasympathetic nervous system activity?",
            "options": [
                "SDNN (Standard deviation of NN intervals)",
                "PNN50 (Percentage of successive RR intervals >50ms)",
                "RMSSD (Root mean square of successive differences)",
                "LF/HF Ratio (Low frequency to High frequency ratio)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the primary metric used by most wearable devices to track recovery because it specifically reflects the 'vagal tone' or the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, making it highly sensitive to short-term changes in recovery status."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a Resting Heart Rate (RHR) that is 8 beats per minute (bpm) higher than their 30-day baseline, despite reporting a 'restful' night. According to Lesson 3, what is the most likely interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client is experiencing a normal fluctuation of no clinical significance",
                "The client has successfully entered a state of 'supercompensation'",
                "The body is under acute physiological stress, possibly indicating overtraining or an impending illness",
                "The wearable device is likely malfunctioning as RHR does not vary by more than 2 bpm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A spike in RHR of more than 5-7 bpm above a stable baseline is a significant indicator of physiological strain, often appearing 24-48 hours before the onset of clinical symptoms of illness or as a sign of sympathetic nervous system dominance."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Research comparing subjective sleep diaries to objective wearable data (Lesson 4) suggests that clients with 'paradoxical insomnia' typically:",
            "options": [
                "Underestimate their total sleep time compared to objective data",
                "Overestimate their Deep sleep duration by 50% or more",
                "Accurately predict their Sleep Onset Latency within 5 minutes",
                "Show higher HRV than the average healthy population"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Sleep Paradox' or Sleep State Misperception occurs when a client's subjective perception of sleep is significantly worse than what objective metrics show. They often feel they were awake for hours when data shows they were in light sleep."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "According to meta-analyses (e.g., de Zambotti et al.), what is the estimated accuracy range for high-end consumer wearables in identifying specific sleep stages (REM/Deep) compared to Polysomnography (PSG)?",
            "options": [
                "95% - 99% (Near-perfect correlation)",
                "85% - 90% (Highly reliable for clinical diagnosis)",
                "60% - 70% (Moderate agreement, prone to misclassification)",
                "20% - 30% (Poor agreement, no better than guessing)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While wearables are excellent at tracking 'Total Sleep Time' (approx. 90% accuracy), their ability to distinguish between specific stages like REM and Deep sleep is lower, typically falling in the 60-70% range compared to the gold-standard PSG."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "When identifying 'Hidden Stressors' in a client's data, what is the 'signature' effect of evening alcohol consumption on sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "Increased HRV and decreased RHR in the first half of the night",
                "Suppressed REM sleep and elevated RHR in the first half of the night",
                "Increased Deep sleep and decreased Respiratory Rate throughout the night",
                "Earlier Sleep Onset Latency with no impact on sleep quality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alcohol is a potent REM suppressant. It also acts as a metabolic stressor, causing a significant increase in RHR and a decrease in HRV as the body works to metabolize the ethanol, particularly during the first 4-5 hours of sleep."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Why is Respiratory Rate (BrPM) considered one of the most stable and useful metrics for identifying acute health changes in a sleep report?",
            "options": [
                "It changes significantly with every sleep cycle transition",
                "It is the only metric that can diagnose Sleep Apnea without a doctor",
                "It typically fluctuates by less than 1-2 breaths per minute from a person's baseline",
                "It is unaffected by external factors like room temperature or altitude"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Respiratory rate is remarkably stable for individuals. An increase of even 1.5 - 2 breaths per minute above the 7-day average is a very strong signal of physiological distress, often more specific than HR or HRV changes."

            "question": "A Sleep Health Coach should prioritize which of the following when making protocol adjustments based on wearable data?",

                "Single-night snapshots to make immediate daily changes",
                "7-day and 30-day rolling averages to identify trends",
                "The 'Sleep Score' provided by the device's proprietary algorithm",
                "Comparing the client's data to the global average of all users"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Single-day data can be 'noisy' due to one-off events. To make evidence-based protocol adjustments, coaches must look at rolling averages to distinguish between temporary fluctuations and genuine shifts in the client's recovery capacity."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which metric is the most reliable 'proxy' for assessing the quality of the 'glymphatic clearance' process, which primarily occurs during Slow Wave Sleep (SWS)?",
            "options": [
                "Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)",
                "Deep Sleep duration/percentage",
                "Movement index (restlessness)",
                "Skin Temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system, responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain, is most active during Slow Wave Sleep (Deep Sleep). Tracking the duration and consistency of this stage is the best available proxy for neurological recovery."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, an 'Oxygen Desaturation Index' (ODI) consistently showing drops below what percentage is highlighted as a 'red flag' requiring a medical referral for potential Sleep Apnea?",
            "options": [
                "98%",
                "95%",
                "90%",
                "80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While occasional minor dips can occur, consistent drops in SpO2 below 90% (desaturations) are a significant clinical red flag for Sleep Disordered Breathing and require the coach to refer the client to a sleep physician for a diagnostic PSG."
