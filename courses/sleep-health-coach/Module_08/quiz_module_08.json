            "question": "According to the Science of Sleep Mastery, why is standard 'Sleep Hygiene' often ineffective as a standalone treatment for chronic insomnia?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses too much on biological rhythms and not enough on environment",
                "It fails to address the conditioned arousal and compensatory behaviors that maintain insomnia",
                "The protocols are too complex for the average client to follow consistently",
                "It has been proven to decrease Sleep Efficiency (SE) in clinical trials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While sleep hygiene is foundational, chronic insomnia is maintained by conditioned arousal and maladaptive habits. Evidence suggests sleep hygiene alone has an effect size of only 0.1 to 0.2, compared to 1.0+ for multi-component CBT-I."

            "question": "In Stimulus Control Therapy (SCT), what is the primary goal of the '15-20 minute rule'?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the amount of REM sleep achieved in the first cycle",
                "To tire the body out through physical movement during the night",
                "To weaken the association between the bed and wakefulness/frustration",
                "To ensure the client reaches a Sleep Efficiency of at least 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control aims to re-establish the bed as a cue for sleep rather than a cue for anxiety or wakefulness by removing the client from the environment when sleep does not occur quickly."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client reports spending 9 hours in bed but only sleeping for 6 hours. What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE), and what is the standard SRT recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "SE is 66%; the Sleep Window should be restricted to 6 hours (but not below 5-5.5 hours)",
                "SE is 75%; the Sleep Window should be increased to 10 hours to allow for more 'sleep opportunity'",
                "SE is 66%; the client should be referred to a sleep lab immediately",
                "SE is 50%; the client should practice Sleep Compression instead of Restriction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "SE is calculated as (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) x 100. 6/9 = 66.7%. SRT involves matching the time in bed to the actual sleep time to build sleep pressure, typically with a floor of 5 to 5.5 hours for safety."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a specific contraindication for aggressive Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT)?",
            "options": [
                "Mild obstructive sleep apnea",
                "A history of generalized anxiety disorder",
                "Seizure disorders or Bipolar Disorder (potential for mania)",
                "Age over 65 years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SRT causes temporary acute sleep deprivation, which can lower the seizure threshold or trigger manic episodes in susceptible individuals. These clients require medical supervision or Sleep Compression instead."

            "question": "During Cognitive Restructuring, a coach identifies a client saying: 'If I don't sleep 8 hours tonight, I will definitely lose my job tomorrow.' This is an example of which cognitive distortion?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Reasoning",
                "Catastrophizing",

                "Labeling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Catastrophizing involves imagining the worst possible outcome of a situation, such as job loss resulting from a single night of poor sleep, which fuels the anxiety-insomnia cycle."

            "question": "How does Autogenic Training (AT) differ from Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)?",
            "options": [
                "AT uses physical tension and release, while PMR uses only visualization",
                "AT focuses on self-induced sensations of warmth and heaviness, while PMR focuses on muscular tension-release cycles",
                "PMR is a mindfulness-based approach, while AT is a biofeedback-based approach",
                "AT is only used for sleep onset, while PMR is only used for middle-of-the-night awakenings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMR involves the physical tensing and relaxing of muscle groups. Autogenic Training is a passive social-psychological technique using visual cues and affirmations to induce heaviness and warmth."

            "question": "In the ACT-I (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Insomnia) framework, what is the 'Paradox of Sleep Effort'?",
            "options": [
                "The more a person tries to force sleep, the more elusive it becomes due to autonomic arousal",
                "Sleeping more on weekends makes it easier to sleep on weekdays",
                "High effort during the day always results in better sleep at night",
                "Accepting sleepiness leads to immediate narcolepsy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ACT-I posits that sleep is a natural process that cannot be 'forced.' The 'effort' to sleep (e.g., rituals, obsessive thoughts) creates the very arousal that prevents sleep from occurring."

            "options": [
                "Environment & Engineering (Optimizing the sleep space)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the DREAM synthesis (Data/Diligence, Restructuring/Resilience, Evaluation/Evidence, Action/Alignment, Mastery), the E stands for Evaluation and Evidence, emphasizing the use of sleep diaries and objective metrics."

            "question": "A Sleep Health Coach notices a client frequently gasping for air and reporting morning headaches. What is the ethically appropriate professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe a specific CPAP machine setting for the client",
                "Begin a 4-week Sleep Restriction protocol to improve efficiency",
                "Refer the client to a physician or sleep specialist for a suspected sleep-disordered breathing evaluation",
                "Suggest the client take high-dose melatonin to stay asleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gasping for air and morning headaches are 'red flag' symptoms for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which is outside the scope of a Sleep Health Coach and requires medical diagnosis."

            "question": "A 2015 meta-analysis (Trauer et al.) comparing CBT-I components to sedative-hypnotics found which of the following regarding long-term outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Medication and CBT-I have identical outcomes after 12 months",
                "CBT-I showed sustained improvements, while medication benefits often diminished or reversed after discontinuation",
                "Medication was significantly more effective for sleep onset latency in the long term",
                "CBT-I was only effective for patients under the age of 40"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that while medications may work quickly, the behavioral and cognitive changes from CBT-I lead to durable, long-term sleep improvements that persist long after the coaching ends."
