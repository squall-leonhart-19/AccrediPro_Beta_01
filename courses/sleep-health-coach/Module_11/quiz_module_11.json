            "question": "In Advanced CBT-I, what is the primary physiological mechanism targeted by Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) to resolve chronic insomnia?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing homeostatic sleep drive by consolidating sleep into a shorter window",
                "Reducing the production of cortisol in the early evening",
                "Shifting the circadian nadir to occur earlier in the night",
                "Enhancing the duration of REM sleep cycles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "SRT works by limiting the time spent in bed to the actual amount of sleep obtained, thereby increasing homeostatic sleep pressure (adenosine buildup) and improving sleep efficiency."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) is struggling to wake up for work. According to chronotherapy principles, when is bright light therapy (10,000 lux) most effective for phase-advancing their rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "Two hours before their desired bedtime",
                "Immediately upon their natural wake-up time in the morning",
                "During the 'forbidden zone' in the early evening",
                "Exactly at the core body temperature nadir"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For phase-advancing (shifting the clock earlier), light exposure should occur shortly after the core body temperature nadir, which typically aligns with the client's natural wake-up time."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Research on the insulin-cortisol connection shows that just one night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",
                "25-30%",
                "45-50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those cited in metabolic health modules, demonstrate that acute sleep loss can reduce insulin sensitivity by 25-30%, mimicking states of pre-diabetes."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When optimizing sleep for high-performance athletes, why is the 'Sleep Extension' strategy (aiming for 9-10 hours) recommended over standard 7-8 hour guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the release of growth hormone and accelerate tissue repair",
                "To reduce the amount of time spent in N3 sleep",
                "To increase the heart rate during sleep for better cardiovascular conditioning",
                "To suppress the glymphatic system's activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Athletes require more sleep to facilitate physical recovery, as the majority of growth hormone secretion occurs during deep N3 sleep, which is prolonged during sleep extension."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Under the D.R.E.A.M. method for shift workers, what does the 'R' (Rhythmic Consistency) specifically advise regarding 'off-days'?",
            "options": [
                "Sleeping as much as possible to pay off the sleep debt",
                "Maintaining a sleep schedule within 1-2 hours of the work-day schedule to minimize circadian 'snap-back'",
                "Reverting immediately to a standard 10 PM to 6 AM schedule",
                "Using high-intensity light exposure at midnight to stay awake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic Consistency aims to prevent 'social jetlag' by keeping the circadian rhythm stabilized, rather than forcing the body to switch back and forth between day and night orientations."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "The glymphatic system, which clears metabolic waste like beta-amyloid from the brain, is significantly more active during which specific sleep stage?",
            "options": [
                "REM Sleep",
                "N1 (Light Sleep)",
                "N2 (Intermediate Sleep)",
                "N3 (Slow Wave Sleep)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Glymphatic clearance is up to 60% more active during N3 (Slow Wave Sleep) when the interstitial space between neurons increases, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out neurotoxins."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which developmental dynamic explains why adolescents often struggle with early school start times?",
            "options": [
                "A biological 'phase delay' that shifts melatonin onset 1-2 hours later",
                "A decrease in the total requirement for REM sleep",
                "An increase in sensitivity to morning blue light",
                "The complete disappearance of the homeostatic sleep drive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Puberty triggers a biological shift in the circadian clock, delaying the timing of melatonin release and making it difficult for adolescents to fall asleep early."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A coach reviewing data from a high-end wearable (Oura, WHOOP) notices a client's Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has dropped significantly while their Resting Heart Rate (RHR) has risen. This likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client is in a state of high recovery and readiness",
                "The autonomic nervous system is under stress or the client is overtraining",
                "The client has reached peak circadian alignment",
                "The glymphatic system is functioning at maximum capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decrease in HRV combined with an increase in RHR is a classic sign of sympathetic nervous system dominance, indicating poor recovery, illness, or excessive stress."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Executive Sarah' (from Lesson 4), which intervention was most effective for reducing her 'tired but wired' feeling at night?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking caffeine until 4 PM to stay productive",
                "Implementing a 90-minute digital sunset and cognitive offloading (Brain Dump)",
                "Increasing her evening exercise intensity",
                "Taking high-dose melatonin (10mg) immediately before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive offloading and a digital sunset reduce the 'alerting signal' and psychological arousal, allowing the natural transition into sleep."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of sleep, chronic sleep fragmentation (waking up multiple times) is linked to brain longevity issues because it prevents:",
            "options": [
                "The buildup of adenosine",
                "The consistent reaching of N3 sleep necessary for glymphatic clearance",
                "The production of cortisol in the morning",
                "The digestion of macronutrients during the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fragmentation disrupts the architecture of sleep, often preventing the brain from spending sufficient, uninterrupted time in N3 sleep, which is vital for long-term cognitive health."
