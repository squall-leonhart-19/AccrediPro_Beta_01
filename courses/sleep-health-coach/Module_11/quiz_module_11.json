            "question": "When implementing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) as part of a CBT-I protocol, what is the generally accepted 'floor' or minimum number of hours a client should be allowed to remain in bed?",
            "options": [
                "4 hours",
                "5 hours",
                "6 hours",
                "No minimum, it is based strictly on the sleep diary average",
                "5.5 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In clinical CBT-I protocols, the 'floor' for Sleep Restriction Therapy is typically 5 hours to prevent excessive daytime sleepiness and ensure safety, even if the client's average sleep time is lower."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD) wants to shift their sleep-wake cycle earlier. According to chronotherapy principles, when should they ideally use bright light therapy?",
            "options": [
                "In the late evening to suppress early melatonin",
                "Immediately upon their natural awakening (e.g., 10:00 AM) to trigger a phase advance",
                "Two hours before their desired bedtime",
                "In the middle of the night if they wake up"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To achieve a phase advance (moving the sleep schedule earlier), bright light therapy should be applied shortly after the core body temperature minimum, which usually occurs shortly after natural awakening in DSPD patients."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Research on metabolic health (Spiegel et al.) demonstrated that restricting sleep to 4 hours per night for just six nights resulted in a ______ reduction in insulin sensitivity.",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "20-25%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that short-term sleep deprivation (4 hours for 6 nights) can reduce insulin sensitivity by approximately 40%, reaching levels comparable to those seen in pre-diabetic individuals."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In the landmark Stanford Basketball study by Cheri Mah, athletes who extended their sleep to 10 hours per night saw what specific improvement in free-throw accuracy?",
            "options": [
                "A 5% increase",
                "A 9% increase",
                "A 15% increase",
                "No significant change in accuracy, only in sprint speed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that sleep extension to 10 hours led to a 9% increase in free-throw shooting accuracy and a 9.2% increase in 3-point field goal percentage."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Within the D.R.E.A.M. method for shift workers, the 'A' stands for 'Anchor Sleep.' What defines a successful anchor sleep period?",
            "options": [
                "Sleeping at least 8 hours regardless of the time of day",
                "A 4-hour block of sleep that remains consistent between both work days and off days",
                "Using a weighted blanket to 'anchor' the body in place",
                "Sleeping only during the hours of 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep is a consistent 4-hour block of sleep taken at the same time every day (e.g., 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM), which helps stabilize the circadian rhythm for shift workers."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "The glymphatic system, responsible for clearing beta-amyloid and tau proteins from the brain, is most active during which stage of sleep?",
            "options": [
                "REM Sleep",
                "N1 (Light Sleep)",

                "N3 (Slow Wave Sleep)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Glymphatic clearance is most efficient during N3 (Slow Wave Sleep), when the interstitial space in the brain increases by up to 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic waste."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "During adolescence, the biological 'circadian delay' causes a shift in melatonin secretion. On average, how much later is melatonin released in teens compared to children?",
            "options": [
                "30 minutes",
                "1 hour",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Puberty triggers a biological shift that delays the onset of melatonin secretion by approximately 2 hours, making it difficult for adolescents to fall asleep before 11:00 PM."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data in the AccrediPro coaching model, a sudden, significant drop in 'Root Mean Square of Successive Differences' (RMSSD) most likely indicates:",
            "options": [

                "Acute physiological stress or impending illness",
                "Successful adaptation to a new workout load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is a primary HRV metric for parasympathetic activity. A significant drop indicates the body is under stress, overtrained, or fighting an infection, signaling a need for increased recovery sleep."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In Stimulus Control therapy, if a client is unable to fall asleep within approximately 20 minutes, they are instructed to leave the bedroom. What is the primary neurological goal of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To increase homeostatic sleep drive through activity",
                "To break the conditioned association between the bed and wakefulness/anxiety",
                "To use cold thermogenesis to lower core body temperature",
                "To ensure they do not reach REM sleep too early"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control aims to weaken the 'conditioned arousal' where the brain associates the bed with being awake or frustrated, and re-establish the bed as a cue for sleep."

            "question": "Sleep deprivation causes a 'double hit' to appetite regulation by affecting which two hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Increased Leptin and Decreased Ghrelin",
                "Decreased Leptin and Increased Ghrelin",

                "Decreased Melatonin and Increased Adenosine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation leads to a decrease in Leptin (the satiety hormone) and an increase in Ghrelin (the hunger hormone), typically resulting in an intake of an extra 300-500 calories the following day."
