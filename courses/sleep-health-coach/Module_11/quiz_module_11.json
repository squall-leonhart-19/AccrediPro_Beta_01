            "question": "In pediatric sleep development, how does the sleep cycle length of a newborn typically compare to that of a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "Newborns have longer cycles (~120 minutes) compared to adults (~90 minutes).",
                "Newborns have shorter cycles (~50-60 minutes) compared to adults (~90 minutes).",
                "Newborns and adults share the same cycle length, but newborns have more REM.",
                "Newborns do not have defined sleep cycles until 6 months of age."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Newborn sleep cycles are significantly shorter, lasting approximately 50-60 minutes, which contributes to more frequent awakenings compared to the 90-minute adult cycle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The adolescent delayed phase shift is primarily driven by a biological delay in the timing of melatonin secretion, making it difficult for teens to fall asleep before 11:00 PM."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome involves a shift where the sleep-wake cycle occurs earlier than desired, common in older adults due to age-related changes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus."
