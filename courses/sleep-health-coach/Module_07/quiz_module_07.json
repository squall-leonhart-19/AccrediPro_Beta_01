            "question": "According to the DREAM Method™ outlined in Lesson 1, the glymphatic system is most active during which stage of sleep, and by what percentage does interstitial space increase to facilitate waste clearance?",
            "options": [
                "REM sleep; 40% increase",
                "N2 sleep; 50% increase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the glymphatic system is primarily active during N3 (Slow Wave Sleep), where interstitial space increases by approximately 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic waste like beta-amyloid."

            "options": [
                "To punish the client for not sleeping",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep restriction therapy aims to limit the time spent in bed to the actual amount of sleep the client is getting, thereby increasing sleep drive (homeostatic pressure) and improving sleep efficiency."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Maintenance Insomnia' (waking at 3 AM and unable to return to sleep). Which physiological factor discussed in Lesson 6 is most likely a primary driver if they also report night sweats and hunger?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nocturnal hypoglycemia can cause the body to release cortisol and adrenaline to raise blood sugar, which triggers a 'stress response' wake-up, often accompanied by sweating or heart palpitations."
