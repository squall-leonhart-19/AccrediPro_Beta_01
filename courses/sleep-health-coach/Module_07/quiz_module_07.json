            "question": "A client possesses the 'slow metabolizer' variant of the CYP1A2 gene. If they consume 200mg of caffeine at 2:00 PM, which of the following is most likely true regarding their sleep at 11:00 PM?",
            "options": [
                "The caffeine will be entirely cleared from their system.",
                "Approximately 100mg (50%) will still be active in their bloodstream.",
                "They may still have over 100mg of caffeine active, significantly inhibiting adenosine binding.",
                "Their melatonin production will be unaffected because caffeine only impacts dopamine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In slow metabolizers, the half-life of caffeine can extend beyond the average 5-6 hours. Even in average metabolizers, 50% remains after 6 hours; a slow metabolizer would have a significant residual amount at 11:00 PM, blocking adenosine receptors and delaying sleep pressure."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism behind the 'rebound effect' observed in the second half of the night after consuming alcohol?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden drop in blood glucose levels.",
                "A surge in Glutamate and Norepinephrine as the sedative effects of GABA wear off.",
                "An increase in Melatonin secretion to compensate for the alcohol.",
                "The activation of the parasympathetic nervous system during alcohol metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As alcohol is metabolized, the initial GABAergic sedation wears off, leading to a compensatory 'rebound' of the excitatory neurotransmitters Glutamate and Norepinephrine, causing fragmentation and early waking."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Magnesium's role in sleep physiology is best described by which of the following actions?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a precursor to Serotonin in the gut.",
                "It functions as a GABA agonist and an NMDA antagonist, reducing neuronal excitability.",
                "It directly stimulates the release of Orexin to maintain wakefulness during the day.",
                "It increases core body temperature to facilitate the transition to N1 sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium supports sleep by binding to GABA receptors (calming the nervous system) and blocking NMDA receptors (preventing excessive calcium-driven excitation)."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "According to the research on Amino Acids, how does the ingestion of 3 grams of Glycine before bed improve sleep quality?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing heart rate variability (HRV).",
                "By stimulating the production of Cortisol.",
                "By decreasing core body temperature through increased peripheral blood flow.",
                "By blocking the absorption of Tryptophan in the blood-brain barrier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycine acts as a vasodilator in the extremities, which helps lower core body temperature—a physiological prerequisite for deep sleep onset."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The 'Gut-Brain-Sleep Axis' is significant for sleep health primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "90-95% of the body's Serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract.",
                "The gut is the only site where Melatonin can be synthesized.",
                "Digestion stops completely during REM sleep.",
                "Microbes in the gut prevent the absorption of caffeine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The gut produces the vast majority of the body's Serotonin, a direct precursor to Melatonin. A healthy microbiome is essential for the metabolic pathways that support sleep-regulating neurotransmitters."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "To manage nocturia and minimize sleep fragmentation, what is the recommended 'Hydration Taper' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Stop all fluid intake 6 hours before bed.",
                "Consume 70% of daily fluids before 4:00 PM and limit intake to small sips 2-3 hours before bed.",
                "Drink 1 liter of water immediately before bed to prevent dehydration.",
                "Only drink caffeinated beverages in the evening to stimulate ADH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Front-loading hydration ensures the body is hydrated while allowing the kidneys to process the bulk of fluids before sleep, minimizing the need for nighttime bathroom trips."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "When designing a sleep-supportive evening meal, why is the ratio of Tryptophan to Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs) important?",
            "options": [
                "LNAAs are toxic to the brain during sleep.",
                "Tryptophan must compete with LNAAs to cross the blood-brain barrier; insulin helps clear LNAAs.",
                "High LNAA levels are required to produce Melatonin.",
                "Tryptophan only works if it is consumed without any carbohydrates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan competes with LNAAs for transport into the brain. Consuming a moderate amount of carbohydrates triggers insulin, which shuttles LNAAs into muscle tissue, giving Tryptophan a 'clear path' to the brain for Serotonin synthesis."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis on Vitamin D and sleep (n=2,485) found that Vitamin D deficiency was most significantly correlated with which sleep metric?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive vivid dreaming.",
                "Increased sleep latency and shorter total sleep duration.",
                "Increased sleep talking (somniloquy).",
                "Decreased sleep apnea severity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D receptors are prevalent in the brainstem areas that regulate sleep. Deficiency is consistently linked to difficulty falling asleep and reduced overall sleep time."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Alcohol-Induced REM Suppression' phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "Alcohol increases REM sleep in the first 2 hours of the night.",
                "Alcohol has no effect on REM sleep, only on Stage 4 sleep.",
                "Alcohol significantly reduces REM sleep in the first half of the night, leading to a REM rebound later.",
                "Alcohol converts REM sleep into Deep SWS sleep permanently."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alcohol is a potent REM suppressant. During the first half of the night, while alcohol levels are high, REM is nearly absent. As it clears, the brain attempts to 'catch up' (REM rebound), leading to intense dreams and light, fragmented sleep."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "What is the optimal timing for a high-glycemic index (GI) evening meal to support sleep onset, according to the module's meal-timing guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "15 minutes before getting into bed.",
                "Exactly 4 hours before bedtime.",
                "Only in the morning; GI should be low in the evening.",
                "High GI meals should be avoided entirely for sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Afaghi et al.) have shown that a high-GI meal consumed 4 hours before bed significantly reduces sleep onset latency compared to low-GI meals or meals eaten closer to bedtime."
