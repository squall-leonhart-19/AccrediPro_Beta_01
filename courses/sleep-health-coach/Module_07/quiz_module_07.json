            "question": "In the context of Sleep Architecture (L1), which stage of sleep is characterized by 'sleep spindles' and 'K-complexes,' typically making up about 50% of total sleep time in adults?",
            "options": [
                "N1 (Light Sleep)",
                "N2 (Intermediate Sleep)",
                "N3 (Deep/Slow Wave Sleep)",
                "REM (Rapid Eye Movement)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N2 sleep is the stage where sleep spindles and K-complexes occur, serving as a neurophysiological protection mechanism against arousal. It accounts for approximately 45-55% of total sleep duration."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A client consistently reports getting only 3 hours of sleep, yet their wearable data and partner observations suggest they are sleeping 7+ hours. Which insomnia phenotype from L2 does this represent?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical Insomnia occurs when there is a significant discrepancy between the client's subjective perception of sleep and objective measures (like actigraphy or PSG), often due to cortical hyperarousal during NREM stages."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Resetting the Master Clock' lesson (L3), what is the minimum light intensity (in lux) typically required at the ocular level to effectively suppress melatonin and signal the SCN for alertness?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While lower levels can have an effect, approximately 1,000 lux of full-spectrum light at the eye is a standard threshold used in clinical protocols to effectively reset the circadian rhythm and suppress evening melatonin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A cooler environment (60-67°F) facilitates the drop in core body temperature necessary to initiate and maintain deep sleep stages."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 50-75% increase in cortisol levels shortly after waking, which prepares the body for the demands of the day. A flattened CAR is often a sign of HPA axis dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation leads to a decrease in Leptin (the satiety hormone) and an increase in Ghrelin (the hunger hormone), which collectively drive increased caloric intake and cravings for high-carb foods."
