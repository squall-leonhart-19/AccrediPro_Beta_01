            "question": "According to the Advanced Sleep Hygiene science, exposure to blue light in the 460-480nm range suppresses melatonin for how much longer compared to green light of equal brightness?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately twice as long",
                "Approximately 30 minutes longer",
                "Approximately four times as long",
                "There is no statistically significant difference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that blue light (460-480nm) suppresses melatonin for about twice as long as green light and shifts circadian rhythms by twice as much, making it a critical factor in digital hygiene."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In Nutritional Synchrony, what is the physiological reason for pairing a small amount of high-glycemic carbohydrates with Tryptophan-rich foods?",
            "options": [
                "To slow down the digestion of protein",
                "To trigger insulin, which clears competing Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs) from the bloodstream",
                "To prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia during the REM cycle",
                "To increase the core body temperature via thermogenesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin secretion causes LNAAs to be taken up into muscle tissue, reducing competition for Tryptophan at the blood-brain barrier and allowing more to enter the brain for serotonin and melatonin synthesis."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis on exercise timing suggests that vigorous exercise should be completed at least how many hours before bedtime to avoid negatively impacting Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)?",
            "options": [
                "30 minutes",
                "1 hour",
                "4 hours",
                "6 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While moderate exercise is beneficial at any time, vigorous exercise ending less than 1 hour before bed can impair sleep quality and increase SOL due to elevated heart rate and core temperature."

            "question": "When applying Cognitive Tools, what is the primary objective of 'Stimulus Control Therapy'?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the total time spent in bed to match actual sleep time",
                "To identify and replace catastrophic thoughts about sleep loss",
                "To re-associate the bed with sleep and sex only, weakening the association with wakefulness/anxiety",
                "To use binaural beats to guide the brain into delta-wave patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control is designed to break the conditioned arousal that occurs when a client uses the bed for activities other than sleep, such as worrying or working."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In the context of Supplementation Science, why is a dose of 0.3mg to 1mg of Melatonin often considered more 'physiological' than standard 5mg or 10mg retail doses?",
            "options": [
                "Higher doses are toxic to the liver",
                "It mimics the body's natural endogenous peak levels, reducing the risk of receptor desensitization",
                "Lower doses act as a sedative, while higher doses act as a stimulant",
                "Melatonin is only effective when taken in micro-doses under 0.1mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological doses (0.3-1mg) are closer to what the pineal gland naturally produces. Excessive doses can lead to 'spillover' effects, daytime grogginess, and potential down-regulation of receptors."

            "question": "A client presents with 'Social Jetlag.' Which of the following data points would confirm this condition?",
            "options": [
                "The client works the night shift three times per week",
                "A discrepancy of >2 hours between the midpoint of sleep on work days versus free days",
                "The client experiences an inability to fall asleep before 2:00 AM every night",
                "The client uses a CPAP machine but still feels fatigued"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is specifically defined as the misalignment between biological time (determined by the circadian clock) and social time, measured by the difference in sleep midpoints between work and free days."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orthosomnia is a term used to describe the perfectionistic pursuit of ideal sleep tracking metrics, which often leads to increased anxiety and poorer sleep outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' stands for Root Cause. A Sleep Health Coach must look beyond symptoms to find the underlying drivers (e.g., anxiety, light exposure, or metabolic issues) to create an effective intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wearing blue-light blockers during the morning commute prevents the sun from suppressing melatonin and resetting the 'day' clock, making it easier to fall asleep upon arriving home."
