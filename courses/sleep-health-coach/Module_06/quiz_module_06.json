            "question": "According to the science of thermoregulation discussed in Lesson 1, what is the required drop in core body temperature to initiate deep sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 0.5°F (0.3°C)",
                "Approximately 2-3°F (1.1-1.7°C)",
                "Exactly 5°F (2.8°C)",
                "Core temperature must remain static for sleep onset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biological sleep onset is triggered by a drop in core body temperature of about 2-3°F. This is why warm baths before bed work—they cause vasodilation, which helps the body shed core heat through the extremities."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Nutritional Synchrony), how does a high-glycemic index (GI) meal consumed 4 hours before bedtime affect sleep architecture compared to a low-GI meal?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly increases sleep latency",
                "It has no measurable effect on sleep",
                "It significantly shortens sleep onset latency",
                "It eliminates REM sleep entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high-GI meals consumed 4 hours before bed can significantly shorten sleep onset latency by increasing the ratio of tryptophan to large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), facilitating serotonin and melatonin production."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Based on the meta-analysis data in Lesson 3, what is the 'critical window' for vigorous exercise to avoid negatively impacting sleep latency due to elevated core temperature?",
            "options": [
                "Exercise should be avoided within 1 hour of bedtime",
                "Exercise should be avoided within 4 hours of bedtime",
                "Exercise must be performed only before 12:00 PM",
                "Vigorous exercise never impacts sleep latency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While regular exercise improves sleep, vigorous activity within 1 hour of bedtime can delay sleep onset because the core body temperature remains too high to facilitate the necessary drop for sleep."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client is practicing Stimulus Control Therapy (SCT). If they cannot fall asleep after approximately 20 minutes, what is the mandatory next step?",
            "options": [
                "Stay in bed and try a breathing exercise",
                "Check their sleep tracker to see their heart rate",
                "Leave the bedroom and engage in a quiet, low-light activity",
                "Turn on the TV to distract the mind until sleepy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core tenet of SCT is to break the conditioned association between the bed and wakefulness/anxiety. If not asleep in ~20 minutes, the client must leave the bed and return only when sleepy."

            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the 'Melatonin Paradox.' What does this concept refer to regarding dosage?",
            "options": [
                "Higher doses (5-10mg) are always more effective than lower doses",
                "Physiological doses (0.3mg-1mg) are often more effective for phase-shifting than pharmacological doses",
                "Melatonin only works if taken exactly at 12:00 AM",
                "Melatonin is only effective when paired with caffeine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Melatonin Paradox' suggests that lower, physiological doses (0.3mg to 1mg) are often more effective for resetting the circadian clock and avoid receptor desensitization compared to high-dose supplements."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the difference (in hours) between the midpoint of sleep on work days and the midpoint of sleep on free days. A discrepancy of >2 hours is associated with metabolic risks."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orthosomnia is a term used to describe the perfectionistic quest for 'perfect' sleep data, where the preoccupation with tracker results actually causes or worsens sleep disturbances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SRT increases sleep pressure and causes temporary sleep deprivation, which can lower the seizure threshold in individuals with epilepsy. It is also contraindicated for Bipolar Disorder (can trigger mania) and high-risk occupations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves keeping a consistent 4-hour portion of the sleep period at the same time every day (e.g., 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) to provide the circadian rhythm with a stable reference point."
