            "question": "Which chronotype is characterized by a 'morning-lark' profile, typically waking naturally between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM and experiencing a significant energy dip in the early evening?",
            "options": ["The Wolf", "The Bear", "The Lion", "The Dolphin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lions are early risers who are most productive in the morning but often struggle with social obligations in the late evening due to early sleep pressure onset."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological reason the 'Anchor Wake Time' is considered the most critical component of circadian entrainment?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for the maximum accumulation of adenosine throughout the day.",
                "It triggers the release of cortisol and sets the timer for melatonin production roughly 14-16 hours later.",
                "It ensures the individual completes exactly five REM cycles per night.",
                "It prevents the occurrence of sleep apnea during the final stages of sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A consistent wake time, especially when paired with light exposure, suppresses melatonin and triggers the cortisol awakening response, which effectively 'restarts' the master biological clock."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client spends 9 hours in bed (10:00 PM to 7:00 AM) but only sleeps for 6 hours and 45 minutes. What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE) percentage?",
            "options": ["65%", "75%", "82%", "91%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated as (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) x 100. In this case, 6.75 hours / 9 hours = 0.75, or 75%."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In the context of Sleep Compression or Restriction Therapy, what is the generally accepted 'Target Sleep Efficiency' before a client is permitted to expand their sleep window?",
            "options": [
                "Above 70%",
                "Above 85-90%",
                "Exactly 100%",
                "Between 50% and 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines for improving sleep consolidation typically require an SE of 85-90% before increasing the time spent in bed to ensure the sleep remains high-quality and continuous."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Why is a 45-minute nap often discouraged in favor of a 20-minute 'power nap'?",
            "options": [
                "A 45-minute nap is too short to provide any cognitive benefits.",
                "The 45-minute mark often coincides with Slow Wave Sleep (N3), leading to intense sleep inertia upon waking.",
                "A 20-minute nap allows the brain to enter REM sleep, whereas 45 minutes does not.",
                "Naps longer than 30 minutes have been shown to permanently damage the circadian rhythm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Waking up from deep Stage 3 (N3) sleep, which typically begins after 20-30 minutes, causes sleep inertia—a state of grogginess and impaired cognitive performance."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Research on 'Sleep Debt' recovery suggests that for every 1 hour of sleep lost, how many nights of optimal sleep are typically required to return to baseline cognitive performance?",
            "options": [
                "Exactly 1 hour of catch-up sleep the following morning.",
                "Sleep debt cannot be recovered once it is lost.",
                "Approximately 2-3 nights of consistent, quality sleep.",
                "At least 7 consecutive nights of 10+ hours of sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by Banks & Dinges, show that recovering from chronic sleep restriction takes longer than a single night; usually, 2-3 nights of normal sleep are required to restore neurobehavioral functions."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "When traveling across time zones, which direction of travel is generally harder for the body to adjust to, and why?",
            "options": [
                "Westward, because it requires a 'phase delay' which is harder for the biological clock.",
                "Eastward, because it requires a 'phase advance' (shortening the day), which goes against the natural drift of the human circadian rhythm.",
                "Northward, because of the changes in magnetic pull on the pineal gland.",
                "Both are equally difficult regardless of the number of time zones crossed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traveling East requires 'phase advancing' the clock. Since the human circadian rhythm is slightly longer than 24 hours, it is easier to stay up later (phase delay/Westward) than to go to sleep earlier (phase advance/Eastward)."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "What is 'Social Jetlag'?",
            "options": [
                "The fatigue felt after attending large social gatherings.",
                "The discrepancy between an individual's biological clock and their social/work schedule (e.g., waking at 6 AM for work but 10 AM on weekends).",
                "A clinical condition where an individual can only sleep in social environments.",
                "The use of social media late at night that disrupts melatonin production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the shift in sleep timing between work days and free days, which can lead to chronic circadian misalignment and metabolic health issues."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client identifies as a 'Wolf' but is forced to wake at 6:00 AM for a corporate job. Which strategy would be most effective for managing this misalignment?",
            "options": [
                "Eating a large, high-protein meal at 10:00 PM to sustain energy.",
                "Using a high-intensity light box (10,000 lux) immediately upon waking at 6:00 AM.",
                "Taking a 2-hour nap every afternoon at 4:00 PM.",
                "Avoiding all sunlight until after 12:00 PM to 'protect' their natural rhythm."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic light exposure in the morning helps 'phase advance' a late chronotype (Wolf), making it easier for them to wake up and feel alert earlier in the day."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "The 'Coffee Nap' technique involves consuming caffeine immediately before a 20-minute nap. Why is this timing effective?",
            "options": [
                "Caffeine helps the brain enter REM sleep faster.",
                "Caffeine takes approximately 20-30 minutes to pass through the gastrointestinal tract and enter the bloodstream, peaking just as the nap ends.",
                "The heat of the coffee raises core body temperature, which triggers waking.",
                "Caffeine neutralizes the melatonin produced during the nap."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because caffeine takes about 20-30 minutes to take effect, the individual benefits from the restorative effects of the nap while waking up just as the caffeine begins to block adenosine receptors."
