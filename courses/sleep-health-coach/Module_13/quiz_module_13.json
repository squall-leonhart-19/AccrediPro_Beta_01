            "question": "During the Sleep Health Intake Process (Lesson 1), what is the primary purpose of identifying 'red flag' symptoms like loud snoring followed by gasping?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) immediately",
                "To determine if the client needs a referral to a medical professional before coaching begins",
                "To adjust the client's pillow height and sleeping position",
                "To sell the client a specific sleep tracking wearable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As a coach, diagnosing is outside the scope of practice. Identifying red flags is critical for ensuring client safety by referring them to a sleep physician for clinical evaluation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The environmental audit specifically focuses on the external variables of Temperature (ideally 65°F/18°C), Light (absolute darkness), and Sound (minimizing disruptions)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Change talk is any client speech that favors movement toward a goal. Expressing a desire for more energy for family is a clear 'Desire' statement in the DARN-CAT acronym of MI."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This goal is Specific (wake time), Measurable (85% efficiency), Achievable/Action-oriented (consistent wake time), Relevant (sleep health), and Time-bound (21 days)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening and acknowledging the client's underlying need (autonomy/me-time) reduces resistance and allows the client to explore the discrepancy between their current behavior and desired outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group coaching leverages social dynamics, allowing clients to realize they aren't alone and learn from the successes and obstacles of their peers."

                "(Total Sleep Time / Total Time in Bed) x 100.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is a standard metric calculated by taking the actual time spent asleep and dividing it by the total time spent in bed, expressed as a percentage."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Limiting Belief' that they 'inherited insomnia from their mother.' Based on Lesson 5, how should a coach address this?",

                "Agree that genetics are 100% responsible for sleep outcomes.",
                "Challenge the belief by presenting data on 'Sleep Plasticity' and the impact of behavioral interventions.",
                "Refer them to a geneticist for testing.",
                "Tell them their mother's sleep history is irrelevant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches help reframe limiting beliefs by providing evidence-based education on how behaviors and environment (epigenetics/habits) can significantly influence sleep, regardless of genetic predisposition."

            "id": "q13_10",

            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in Sleep Efficiency.",
                "Reduction in sleep latency from 45 minutes to 15 minutes.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While sleep metrics (SE, Latency) are objective/direct, improvements in mood, focus, and productivity are 'soft' metrics that demonstrate the real-world value (ROI) of the coaching intervention."
