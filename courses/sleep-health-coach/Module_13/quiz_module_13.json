            "question": "According to advanced chronobiology research, which genetic polymorphism is most closely associated with the 'Extreme Morningness' phenotype and a higher sensitivity to sleep pressure?",
            "options": [
                "The PER3-4/4 (short) allele",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PER3-5/5 (long) allele is associated with morning chronotypes and higher homeostatic sleep pressure, making individuals more sensitive to sleep deprivation compared to the short allele (PER3-4/4)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that acute sleep restriction significantly alters hunger hormones, specifically decreasing the satiety hormone (Leptin) by ~18% and increasing the hunger hormone (Ghrelin) by ~28%."

            "question": "A client presents with a Sleep Efficiency (SE) of 65% (Time in Bed: 8 hours; Total Sleep Time: 5.2 hours). Using CBT-I Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) protocols, what should be the initial prescribed sleep window?",
            "options": [
                "8 hours, but with a later bedtime",
                "5.5 to 6 hours (matching TST but not dropping below 5 hours)",
                "4 hours (to maximize sleep pressure immediately)",
                "7 hours, as 5.2 hours is dangerously low"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SRT sets the initial sleep window to match the client's current average Total Sleep Time (TST), though most practitioners set a minimum floor of 5 to 5.5 hours to ensure safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is primarily active during Slow Wave Sleep (SWS), where the interstitial space increases by approximately 60% to allow cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic waste."
