            "question": "Which specific wavelength of blue light is most potent at suppressing melatonin production via the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells?",
            "options": [
                "380-420 nm",
                "460-480 nm",

                "630-670 nm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the peak sensitivity for melatonin suppression occurs in the blue light spectrum between 460-480 nm, which directly impacts the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, what is the maximum recommended continuous background noise level for a restorative sleep environment?",
            "options": [
                "20 dB",
                "30 dB",
                "45 dB",
                "55 dB"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHO recommends that continuous background noise in bedrooms should not exceed 30 dB to prevent sleep fragmentation and physiological arousal."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "What physiological process is triggered by 'distal vasodilation' (warming of hands and feet) that facilitates rapid sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "Increase in heart rate variability",
                "Decrease in core body temperature",
                "Increase in cortisol secretion",
                "Decrease in melatonin synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Distal vasodilation allows heat to escape from the core to the extremities, leading to a drop in core body temperature, which is a primary biological signal for sleep initiation."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A 2016 study on indoor air quality found that increasing fresh air ventilation to reduce CO2 levels below what threshold significantly improved sleep depth and next-day cognitive performance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that when CO2 levels are maintained below 800 ppm through proper ventilation, subjects report higher sleep quality and demonstrate better concentration the following day."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "For a side sleeper (lateral position), what is the primary ergonomic goal of a pillow to maintain spinal alignment?",
            "options": [
                "To keep the chin tucked toward the chest",
                "To allow the head to tilt slightly backward",
                "To fill the gap between the ear and the lateral edge of the shoulder",
                "To ensure the head is lower than the cervical spine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In side sleeping, the pillow's 'loft' must match the distance between the ear and the shoulder to maintain a neutral cervical spine and prevent muscle strain."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "How does 'Pink Noise' differ from 'White Noise' in its application for sleep masking?",
            "options": [
                "Pink noise has higher power at lower frequencies, mimicking natural sounds like rain",
                "Pink noise has equal power across all frequencies, sounding like static",
                "Pink noise is only effective for masking high-pitched sounds",
                "Pink noise increases cortical arousal more than white noise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pink noise follows a 1/f power spectrum, meaning it has more energy at lower frequencies. This is often perceived as more 'soothing' and has been shown to enhance slow-wave sleep."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "The 'Inverse Square Law' suggests that doubling the distance from an EMF-emitting device (like a smartphone) reduces the radiation exposure by what factor?",
            "options": [
                "25%",
                "50%",
                "75%",
                "400% (Reduced to 1/4 of the original intensity)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Inverse Square Law states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source; doubling the distance reduces exposure to 25% (1/4) of the original level."

                "Linalool",
                "Limonene",
                "Eucalyptol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Linalool is a terpene alcohol found in lavender that interacts with the GABA system to reduce anxiety and promote sedation, as evidenced by numerous clinical trials."

            "question": "A client reports waking up with lower back pain that dissipates after 30 minutes of movement. According to Lesson 6, what is the most likely environmental culprit?",
            "options": [
                "The room temperature is too low (below 15°C)",
                "The mattress has lost its structural integrity (sagging)",
                "The use of a weighted blanket",
                "High humidity levels in the bedroom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Morning back pain that improves with movement is a classic sign of poor spinal support from a mattress that is too soft or sagging, causing the spine to fall out of a neutral position during the night."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended relative humidity range for a bedroom to optimize respiratory health and prevent mucosal drying?",
            "options": [
                "10% - 20%",
                "30% - 50%",
                "60% - 80%",
                "Above 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A humidity range of 30-50% is ideal; levels below 30% can dry out respiratory membranes, while levels above 50% promote the growth of dust mites and mold, both of which disrupt sleep."
