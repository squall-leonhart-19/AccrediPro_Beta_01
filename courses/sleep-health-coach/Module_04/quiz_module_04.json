            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "In the Bio-Psychosocial Model of sleep, which of the following is categorized as a 'precipitating factor' for chronic insomnia?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic predisposition to high autonomic arousal",
                "A sudden stressful life event like a job loss or bereavement",
                "Long-term use of blue-light emitting devices before bed",
                "The development of 'sleep effort' and anxiety about not sleeping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Precipitating factors are acute triggers that initiate sleep disturbance. While genetics are predisposing and sleep effort is perpetuating, a sudden stressor is a classic precipitant."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, specifically feeling exhausted all day but experiencing a surge of energy at 10:00 PM. Which HPA axis dysfunction is most likely occurring?",
            "options": [
                "An exaggerated Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)",
                "Chronically low morning cortisol (hypocortisolism)",
                "A loss of the diurnal rhythm with elevated evening cortisol",
                "Excessive melatonin production inhibiting cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'tired but wired' state is often caused by a failure of the HPA axis to downregulate in the evening, leading to elevated nocturnal cortisol levels that inhibit sleep onset."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which hormone is known to have a potent 'GABAergic' effect by metabolizing into allopregnanolone, thereby acting as a natural sedative?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen",
                "Progesterone",
                "Testosterone",
                "Luteinizing Hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone metabolizes into allopregnanolone, which crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to GABA-A receptors, promoting relaxation and deep sleep."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A client reports consistent awakenings at 3:00 AM accompanied by a rapid heartbeat and mild sweating. Based on Lesson 4, what is the most likely metabolic trigger?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive protein intake at dinner",
                "Nocturnal hypoglycemia triggering an adrenaline/cortisol surge",
                "A surge in insulin levels during REM sleep",
                "Inadequate glycogen storage in the adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops too low (nocturnal hypoglycemia), the body releases counter-regulatory hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to mobilize glucose, which causes a 'panic' awakening."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Ruminative thinking and 'mental rehearsal' contribute to sleep disturbance primarily by increasing activity in which brain region?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "The Pons",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rumination and anticipatory anxiety keep the Prefrontal Cortex active, maintaining a state of cognitive arousal that prevents the transition into the unconscious sleep state."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Magnesium deficiency is a common root cause of poor sleep quality because Magnesium acts as a physiological antagonist to which excitatory neurotransmitter receptor?",
            "options": [
                "GABA-A",
                "NMDA (Glutamate)",
                "Dopamine D2",
                "Serotonin 5-HTP"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium sits in the NMDA receptor channel, blocking glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter) from over-stimulating the neuron, thus promoting neural 'calm'."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "According to the Gut-Brain-Sleep Axis research, approximately what percentage of the body's serotonin (the precursor to melatonin) is produced in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "50-60%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of serotonin—roughly 90-95%—is produced by the enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract, highlighting the importance of gut health for sleep."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "What effect does chronic subclinical inflammation, evidenced by elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6), typically have on sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the duration of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS)",
                "It causes a reduction in SWS and increased sleep fragmentation",
                "It eliminates REM sleep entirely",
                "It has no measurable effect on sleep stages"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha are known to disrupt sleep architecture, specifically reducing restorative Slow Wave Sleep and increasing the number of awakenings."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client with a 'high-stress' job shows a flat Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and low ferritin levels. Which two root causes should the coach address first?",
            "options": [
                "Blood sugar and Estrogen",
                "HPA axis exhaustion and Micronutrient deficiency",
                "Gut microbiome and Blue light exposure",
                "Cognitive rumination and Melatonin supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A flat CAR is a marker of HPA axis dysfunction/exhaustion, and low ferritin is a clear micronutrient (iron) deficiency, both of which significantly impact sleep quality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a practical coaching application for a client suspected of having blood-sugar related nocturnal awakenings?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting a high-sugar fruit snack right before bed",
                "Recommending a 24-hour fast to 'reset' insulin",
                "Advocating for a balanced 'bridge snack' of protein and healthy fats 1 hour before bed",
                "Encouraging the client to drink 16oz of water at 2:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'bridge snack' containing protein and fat helps stabilize blood glucose levels throughout the night, preventing the hypoglycemic dip that triggers cortisol-induced awakenings."
