            "question": "In the Bio-Psychosocial (3P) Model of insomnia, which of the following is considered a 'perpetuating' factor?",
            "options": [
                "A genetic predisposition to light sleep",
                "A sudden job loss or bereavement",
                "Spending excessive time in bed to 'catch up' on sleep",
                "A high-stress personality type"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perpetuating factors are the behaviors or compensatory strategies (like napping or staying in bed too long) that keep sleep issues alive long after the initial trigger has passed."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms in the evening. According to the Cortisol Connection lesson, what is the most likely physiological finding?",
            "options": [
                "A robust Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)",
                "Elevated evening cortisol levels and HPA axis hyperarousal",
                "Extremely low levels of ACTH throughout the day",
                "A rapid drop in core body temperature at 8:00 PM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress often leads to a flattened diurnal curve where cortisol remains high in the evening instead of dropping, causing cognitive arousal and difficulty initiating sleep."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "How does Progesterone specifically influence sleep quality in the female endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a potent NMDA agonist to increase alertness",
                "It metabolizes into allopregnanolone, which enhances GABAergic activity",
                "It suppresses melatonin production in the pineal gland",
                "It lowers the threshold for nocturnal awakenings during the follicular phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone has a sedative effect because its metabolite, allopregnanolone, acts on GABA-A receptors in the brain, much like a natural anxiolytic."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which mechanism explains why a client with poor metabolic health might wake up consistently at 3:00 AM?",
            "options": [
                "A surge in insulin causing deep NREM sleep",
                "Nocturnal hypoglycemia triggering a compensatory release of cortisol and adrenaline",
                "Excessive glycogen storage in the liver preventing REM sleep",
                "A decrease in Ghrelin levels during the second half of the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops too low (hypoglycemia), the body releases stress hormones (cortisol and adrenaline) to trigger gluconeogenesis, which inadvertently causes a 'stress wake-up'."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Micronutrients, what is the biochemical role of Magnesium in sleep regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a precursor to Vitamin D synthesis",
                "It functions as an NMDA antagonist and helps regulate GABA",
                "It increases the breakdown of serotonin in the gut",
                "It prevents the absorption of iron in the restless leg syndrome pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium supports sleep by blocking NMDA (an excitatory neurotransmitter) and supporting GABA (an inhibitory neurotransmitter), promoting neuromuscular relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "What percentage of the body's serotonin, a precursor to melatonin, is estimated to be produced in the gastrointestinal tract?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 60-70%",
                "Approximately 90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of serotonin (90-95%) is produced in the gut by enterochromaffin cells and certain gut bacteria, highlighting the importance of the microbiome for sleep."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which pro-inflammatory cytokines are most frequently associated with sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness when chronically elevated?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C and Vitamin E",
                "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)",
                "Dopamine and Acetylcholine",
                "Oxytocin and Vasopressin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IL-6 and TNF-α are key inflammatory markers that, when elevated, interfere with sleep architecture and increase the 'sleep pressure' felt during the day."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the context of psychological root causes, how does 'Rumination' differ from 'Worry'?",
            "options": [
                "Rumination is future-oriented; Worry is past-oriented",
                "Rumination involves repetitive thinking about past failures; Worry is focused on future threats",
                "Rumination only occurs during REM sleep; Worry only occurs during NREM sleep",
                "There is no difference; they are clinical synonyms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rumination typically involves 'chewing' on past events or symptoms, whereas worry is the apprehensive anticipation of future negative outcomes; both contribute to cognitive hyperarousal."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 8 found that the relationship between sleep and pain is 'bidirectional.' What did the data suggest was the stronger direction of influence?",
            "options": [
                "Pain causing poor sleep is a significantly stronger predictor",
                "Poor sleep quality causing increased pain sensitivity the next day is a stronger predictor",
                "Both directions are exactly equal in statistical weight",
                "Neither; the relationship was found to be statistically insignificant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that while pain disrupts sleep, the effect of a bad night's sleep on increasing pain sensitivity the following day is often a stronger and more reliable predictor."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client with low ferritin levels (Iron) is most likely to experience which sleep-disrupting condition?",
            "options": [
                "Obstructive Sleep Apnea",
                "Narcolepsy Type 1",
                "Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) / Periodic Limb Movement Disorder",
                "Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iron is a co-factor for dopamine synthesis in the brain; low iron (ferritin < 75 ng/mL) is a primary root cause for Restless Leg Syndrome and limb movements during sleep."
