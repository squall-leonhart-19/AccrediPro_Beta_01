            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), often called the 'Master Clock,' is located in which specific region of the brain?",
            "options": [
                "The posterior pituitary gland",
                "The anterior hypothalamus",
                "The pineal gland",
                "The hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN is a tiny region of the brain in the anterior hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm, allowing it to receive direct light signals from the eyes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which specialized cells in the retina are primarily responsible for transmitting non-visual light signals to the SCN via the Retinohypothalamic Tract (RHT)?",
            "options": [
                "Rods and Cones",
                "Bipolar cells",
                "Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs)",
                "Amacrine cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ipRGCs contain the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to blue light (approx. 480nm) and transmits brightness information directly to the SCN to regulate the circadian clock."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Cortisol Awakening Response' (CAR) that is significantly blunted. According to clinical guidelines, when should the CAR peak in a healthy individual?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately upon eye opening",
                "30 to 45 minutes after waking",
                "2 hours after the first meal",
                "Precisely at solar noon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a sharp increase in cortisol levels (usually 50-75% above waking levels) that occurs 30-45 minutes after awakening, signaling the body's preparation for the day's demands."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Research on the PER3 gene suggests that individuals with the 'long' allele (PER3 5/5) typically exhibit which circadian characteristic?",
            "options": [
                "Extreme eveningness (Night Owls)",
                "Resistance to sleep deprivation",

                "Complete lack of a circadian rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PER3 5/5 genotype is associated with morningness and a faster buildup of homeostatic sleep pressure, making these individuals more sensitive to sleep loss than those with the shorter 4/4 allele."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client experiences 'Social Jetlag' of 3 hours. How is this metric specifically calculated in a coaching assessment?",
            "options": [
                "The difference between total sleep time on work days vs. free days",
                "The difference between the mid-point of sleep on work days and the mid-point of sleep on free days",
                "The number of hours of sunlight missed during the work week",
                "The delay in melatonin onset (DLMO) compared to the general population"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the discrepancy between biological time (tracked by sleep on free days) and social time (tracked by work schedules), calculated as the difference in the mid-point of sleep (MSF - MSW)."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which peripheral zeitgeber has been shown to be the most powerful 'reset' signal for the circadian clock of the liver?",
            "options": [
                "Ambient room temperature",
                "Physical exercise (HIIT)",
                "Timing of food intake (Nutrient sensing)",
                "Auditory stimulation (White noise)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the SCN is primarily regulated by light, peripheral clocks—especially in the liver—are heavily influenced by the timing of food intake via insulin and glucose-sensing pathways."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to the Phase Response Curve (PRC), exposure to bright light (2,500+ lux) in the late evening (before the core body temperature minimum) will result in what shift?",
            "options": [
                "A phase advance (earlier sleep/wake timing)",
                "A phase delay (later sleep/wake timing)",
                "No change in circadian timing",
                "An immediate suppression of cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light exposure in the evening or early night, before the Core Body Temperature minimum (Tmin), causes a phase delay, pushing the circadian clock later."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "To facilitate sleep onset, the core body temperature (CBT) must undergo a rhythmic drop. What is the typical magnitude of this drop in a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "0.1°C to 0.2°C",
                "0.5°C to 1.0°C",
                "2.0°C to 3.0°C",
                "The temperature must remain perfectly static for sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decline in core body temperature of approximately 0.5°C to 1.0°C (coupled with a rise in distal/skin temperature) is a physiological requirement for the transition into sleep."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the 'Reset' phase of the DREAM Method™, which protocol is recommended for a client struggling with Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD)?",
            "options": [
                "Bright light exposure at 9:00 PM",
                "High-intensity exercise at 10:00 PM",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For DSPD (Night Owls), the goal is to advance the clock. This is achieved through early morning light exposure, which pulls the circadian rhythm earlier."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis suggests that 'blue-blocking' glasses are most effective for sleep when used during which window?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Blue-blocking glasses are used as a strategic 'darkness' protocol to prevent the suppression of melatonin by artificial evening light, typically recommended 2-3 hours before bed."
