            "options": [
                "Recovery; focusing on physical muscle repair during N3 sleep",
                "Rhythm; focusing on the alignment of the Circadian pacemaker with external cues",

                "Restriction; focusing on limiting time spent in bed to increase sleep drive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RESTORE Method™ begins with Rhythm, which addresses the Circadian biology and the synchronization of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with zeitgebers like light and temperature."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes the physiological difference between natural sleep and sedation (e.g., from alcohol or benzodiazepines) as discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Sedation enhances the production of sleep spindles in N2 sleep",
                "Sedation creates a 'top-down' inhibition of consciousness that lacks the restorative cycling of REM and NREM stages",
                "Natural sleep is identical to sedation, but sedation lasts longer",
                "Sedation increases the amplitude of Delta waves compared to natural N3 sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sedation is the pharmacological switching off of brain cells, which lacks the characteristic architecture and restorative benefits of natural sleep cycles, particularly suppressing REM sleep."

            "options": [
                "Sleep quality improves immediately and then plateaus",
                "Sleep quality may temporarily decline as the body adjusts to new habits before significant improvement occurs",
                "The linear relationship between hours of sleep and cognitive performance",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The J-Curve illustrates that as clients implement behavioral changes (like caffeine weaning or stimulus control), they may feel worse initially before reaching a higher baseline of health."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Based on the 2013 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3, what is the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on REM sleep in the first half of the night?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly increases REM sleep duration",
                "It has no effect on REM sleep but increases N3 sleep",
                "It significantly suppresses REM sleep and increases sleep fragmentation in the second half of the night",
                "It causes the brain to skip N1 and N2 stages entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alcohol acts as a sedative that suppresses REM sleep early in the night; as it is metabolized, it causes a 'rebound' effect leading to frequent awakenings and fragmented sleep."
