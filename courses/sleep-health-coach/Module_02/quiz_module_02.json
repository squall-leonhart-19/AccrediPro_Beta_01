            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), often called the 'Master Clock,' is located in which specific region of the brain?",
            "options": [
                "The Anterior Hypothalamus",
                "The Posterior Pituitary",
                "The Pineal Gland",
                "The Medulla Oblongata"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The SCN is a tiny region of the brain in the anterior hypothalamus, situated directly above the optic chiasm, allowing it to receive direct light signals from the retina."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs) are most sensitive to which specific wavelength of light to suppress melatonin?",
            "options": [
                "650nm (Red light)",
                "550nm (Green light)",
                "480nm (Blue light)",
                "380nm (Ultraviolet light)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ipRGCs contain the photopigment melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity around 480nm. This 'short-wavelength' blue light is the most potent signal for suppressing melatonin and phase-shifting the circadian clock."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) is considered the 'gold standard' for measuring circadian phase. In a healthy adult, DLMO typically occurs how long before habitual sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "15-30 minutes",
                "2-3 hours",
                "5-6 hours",
                "Exactly at sunset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DLMO usually occurs 2 to 3 hours before an individual's natural sleep onset. It marks the point where the pineal gland begins secreting melatonin in response to dimming light levels."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client presents with extreme 'Night Owl' tendencies, struggling to wake before 10:00 AM. According to chronobiology research, which genetic variation is most likely involved?",
            "options": [
                "A long allele version of the PER3 gene",
                "A short allele version of the PER3 gene",
                "A mutation in the OREXIN-A receptor",
                "Under-expression of the CLOCK gene"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PER3 gene polymorphism is a key marker for chronotype. The shorter allele (PER3 4/4) is significantly associated with eveningness (Night Owls), while the longer allele (PER3 5/5) is associated with morningness."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "To initiate sleep, the body must undergo a thermoregulatory shift. What is the required drop in core body temperature for optimal sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 0.1°C",
                "Approximately 1°C (2-3°F)",
                "Approximately 5°C",
                "Core temperature must actually rise to induce sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep onset is triggered by a drop in core body temperature of approximately 1°C (2-3°F). This is facilitated by vasodilation in the hands and feet (distal warming) to shed internal heat."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "How is 'Social Jetlag' (SJL) mathematically calculated in a coaching assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Total sleep time on weekends minus total sleep time on weekdays",
                "The difference between the mid-sleep point on free days and the mid-sleep point on work days",
                "The number of hours of sunlight exposure divided by hours of screen time",
                "The time of melatonin onset minus the time of cortisol peak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is defined as the discrepancy between the biological clock (measured by mid-sleep on free days, MSF) and the social clock (mid-sleep on work days, MSW). The formula is |MSF - MSW|."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to the Phase Response Curve (PRC), if a coach wants to 'Phase Advance' a client (move their sleep/wake time earlier), when should bright light exposure be administered?",
            "options": [
                "In the late evening, just before bed",
                "In the middle of the night (3:00 AM)",
                "Immediately upon waking in the early morning",
                "In the late afternoon (4:00 PM)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Light exposure in the early morning (the 'advance zone' of the PRC) causes a phase advance, shifting the circadian rhythm earlier. Light in the evening causes a phase delay."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the DREAM Method™, the 'R' stands for Reset. What is the primary objective of the 'Anchor Wake Time' intervention during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize REM sleep duration",
                "To reduce the client's caffeine metabolism",
                "To stabilize the SCN by providing a consistent daily 'starting point' for the circadian clock",
                "To ensure the client gets exactly 8 hours of sleep every night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Anchor Wake Time is the most critical tool for resetting the circadian rhythm. By waking at the same time every day (including weekends), the client provides a consistent signal to the SCN to begin its 24-hour cycle."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A 2019 study published in the Journal of Health Psychology found that for every hour of Social Jetlag experienced, there was a specific increase in the likelihood of heart disease. What was that percentage?",
            "options": [
                "2%",
                "11%",
                "25%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research has shown that every hour of social jetlag is associated with an 11% increase in the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, highlighting the severe metabolic impact of circadian misalignment."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which 'Peripheral Zeitgeber' is most responsible for entraining the clocks in the liver and digestive system, independent of the SCN?",
            "options": [
                "Ambient noise levels",
                "Atmospheric pressure",
                "Food intake and nutrient timing",
                "Cognitive load/Mental stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the SCN is primarily entrained by light, peripheral organs like the liver, pancreas, and gut are heavily influenced by the timing of food intake. Eating at the 'wrong' biological time (e.g., late at night) can cause misalignment between the SCN and peripheral clocks."
