            "question": "When utilizing the STOP-BANG screening tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), which of the following scores indicates a 'High Risk' requiring an immediate medical referral?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 1-2",
                "A score of 3-4",

                "Any score that includes 'Snoring' as a symptom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to clinical guidelines, a STOP-BANG score of 5-8 indicates a high risk for OSA. Scores of 3-4 indicate intermediate risk, while 0-2 indicate low risk."

            "question": "A client reports an 'irresistible urge' to move their legs that worsens during evening rest and is temporarily relieved by walking. Which clinical diagnostic criteria (the URGE acronym) is being described?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The URGE acronym (Urge to move, Rest induced, Gets better with movement, Evening worsening) is the gold standard for diagnosing Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). PLMD is a motor disorder often diagnosed via PSG, whereas RLS is a clinical sensory-motor diagnosis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narcolepsy Type 1 is characterized by the presence of cataplexy and a deficiency in the neurotransmitter hypocretin (orexin). Narcolepsy Type 2 involves excessive daytime sleepiness but lacks cataplexy."

            "options": [
                "RBD occurs during N3 deep sleep, while sleepwalking occurs in REM",
                "Sleepwalking involves acting out dreams, while RBD involves aimless wandering",
                "RBD involves a loss of muscle atonia during REM, leading to dream-enactment, often in the second half of the night",
                "RBD is common in children, while sleepwalking is a sign of neurodegeneration in adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RBD occurs during REM sleep when the normal muscle paralysis (atonia) fails, allowing the person to physically act out vivid, often violent dreams. Sleepwalking is a non-REM parasomnia occurring in N3 sleep."

            "explanation": "AHI severity scales are: Mild (5-15 events/hr), Moderate (15-30 events/hr), and Severe (>30 events/hr). An AHI of 18 falls into the Moderate category."
