            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Research on metabolic mastery indicates that restricting sleep to 4 hours for just one night can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "20-25%",

                "55-60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, such as those by Donga et al. (2010), demonstrate that a single night of partial sleep deprivation can reduce insulin sensitivity by up to 40%, comparable to the metabolic profile of a person with type 2 diabetes."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Immune Architecture' lesson, individuals sleeping fewer than 6 hours per night are how many times more likely to develop a clinical cold when exposed to a virus?",
            "options": [
                "2.1 times",
                "4.2 times",

                "8.0 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A landmark study by Prather et al. (2015) found that participants sleeping less than 6 hours were 4.2 times more likely to develop a cold compared to those sleeping more than 7 hours."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "When coaching a client to manage eastward jet lag (advancing the clock), which light exposure strategy is most effective according to the Phase Response Curve (PRC)?",
            "options": [
                "Bright light exposure in the early morning (local time) and light avoidance in the evening",
                "Bright light exposure in the late evening to delay the rhythm",
                "Complete darkness for the first 24 hours of arrival",
                "High-intensity blue light exposure only during the flight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "To advance the circadian rhythm (eastward travel), clients need bright light exposure in the biological morning and light restriction in the biological evening to shift the internal clock forward."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In the Stanford basketball study (Mah et al., 2011), what was the specific outcome of extending sleep to 10 hours per night for several weeks?",
            "options": [
                "A 5% increase in sprint speed only",
                "A 9% increase in free-throw and 3-point field goal accuracy",
                "A 15% reduction in perceived exertion with no change in accuracy",
                "A 20% increase in muscle mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep extension to 10 hours resulted in significant improvements in shooting accuracy (9% increase) and faster sprint times, highlighting the role of sleep in neuromuscular recovery."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research shows that the interstitial space in the brain increases by up to 60% during N3 (Slow Wave Sleep), allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic toxins like Beta-amyloid."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "A geriatric client reports falling asleep at 7:00 PM and waking up at 3:00 AM. This is a classic presentation of which age-related circadian shift?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (ASPS) is common in older adults, characterized by a shift of the circadian rhythm to an earlier schedule, often caused by changes in light sensitivity and ocular aging."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "During adolescence, what biological change occurs to the homeostatic sleep drive (Process S)?",
            "options": [
                "The sleep drive builds up faster, requiring earlier bedtimes",
                "The sleep drive builds up more slowly, allowing adolescents to stay awake longer",
                "The sleep drive is completely replaced by the circadian rhythm",
                "There is no change in the sleep drive; only social factors change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biologically, the accumulation of sleep pressure (Process S) slows down during puberty, which, combined with a circadian phase delay, makes it difficult for adolescents to feel tired early in the evening."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "When interpreting wearable data, a 'recovery' score is often heavily weighted by which metric that reflects autonomic nervous system balance?",

                "Total Sleep Time (TST)",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Respiratory Rate",
                "Movement Index"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is a primary indicator of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems; a higher HRV generally indicates better recovery and readiness."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Which hormonal profile is typically observed in a client suffering from chronic short sleep duration (less than 6 hours)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation leads to a decrease in Leptin (the satiety hormone) and an increase in Ghrelin (the hunger hormone), significantly increasing caloric cravings."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "For shift workers, which rotation schedule is scientifically recommended to minimize circadian disruption?",
            "options": [
                "Backward rotation (Night -> Evening -> Day)",
                "Forward rotation (Day -> Evening -> Night)",
                "Rapid rotation (Changing shifts every 2 days)",
                "Permanent night shifts with weekend 'catch-up' days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forward rotation (clockwise) is easier for the human body to adapt to because the natural human circadian rhythm is slightly longer than 24 hours, making it easier to stay up later than to go to bed earlier."
