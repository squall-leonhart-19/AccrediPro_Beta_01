            "question": "Research discussed in 'Metabolic Mastery' indicates that restricting sleep to 4 hours for just one night can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "20-25%",

                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A landmark study by Donga et al. (2010) demonstrated that a single night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) results in a 35-40% reduction in insulin sensitivity, comparable to the metabolic profile of a person with Type 2 diabetes."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the lesson on 'Immune Architecture,' what was the observed effect of sleep deprivation on individuals receiving a Hepatitis A or Influenza vaccine?",
            "options": [
                "No significant difference in immune response",
                "A 50% reduction in antibody production 4 weeks post-vaccination",

                "A 20% increase in inflammatory cytokines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that individuals who are sleep-deprived during the time of vaccination produce less than half the antibody response of those who slept normally, significantly compromising long-term immunity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves keeping a specific 4-hour block of sleep constant across both work days and days off to provide the master clock with a consistent temporal reference point."

                "No change in performance, only improved mood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stanford study showed that sleep extension to 10 hours led to a statistically significant 9% increase in shooting accuracy, alongside faster sprint times and improved reaction speeds."

            "id": "q15_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Glymphatic clearance of metabolic byproducts like Beta-Amyloid is significantly increased during N3 (Deep/Slow Wave Sleep) when the interstitial space between neurons increases by up to 60%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As we age, the circadian rhythm tends to shift earlier, leading to earlier sleep onset and earlier morning awakenings, often resulting in a mismatch with social obligations."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which neurobiological change explains the 'biological phase delay' typically seen in adolescents?",

                "An overactive prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adolescents experience a slower build-up of sleep pressure and a circadian shift that delays melatonin secretion by roughly 2 hours, making it biologically difficult to fall asleep early."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "When interpreting wearable data (Lesson 8), a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during sleep generally indicates:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV (the variation in time between heartbeats) is a marker of parasympathetic dominance, suggesting the body is in a state of rest, repair, and high resilience."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "The 'Metabolic Double-Whammy' of sleep deprivation refers to which hormonal shift?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep loss triggers a rise in ghrelin, which signals hunger, and a drop in leptin, which signals fullness, leading to increased caloric intake and cravings for high-carbohydrate foods."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "To minimize jet lag when traveling West (delaying the clock), a Sleep Coach should advise the client to seek bright light at what time in the new destination?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Traveling West requires a phase delay. According to the Phase Response Curve (PRC), bright light exposure in the evening helps 'push' the internal clock later to align with the new time zone."
