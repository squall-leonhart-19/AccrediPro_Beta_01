            "question": "In the context of the HPA axis, what is the primary physiological driver behind a 'cortisol spike' at 3:00 AM that causes sudden wakefulness?",
            "options": [
                "A natural surge in melatonin that triggers a secondary cortisol release",
                "A compensatory response to nocturnal hypoglycemia or blood sugar instability",
                "The normal onset of the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)",
                "Excessive accumulation of adenosine in the basal forebrain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops too low during the night (nocturnal hypoglycemia), the HPA axis is activated to release cortisol, which triggers gluconeogenesis to raise blood sugar, but simultaneously causes alertness and wakefulness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is most closely associated with the activity of the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PSNS) and vagal tone?",
            "options": [
                "LF/HF Ratio (Low Frequency to High Frequency)",
                "SDNN (Standard deviation of NN intervals)",
                "rMSSD (Root mean square of successive differences)",
                "The Total Power spectrum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "rMSSD is the primary time-domain metric used to estimate vagally mediated changes reflected in HRV. Higher rMSSD values generally indicate better parasympathetic recovery and readiness for sleep."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Mammalian Dive Reflex,' used to stimulate the Vagus nerve for rapid nervous system cooling, is most effectively triggered by which action?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking a glass of ice-cold water rapidly",
                "Applying a warm compress to the back of the neck",
                "Submerging the face in water below 50°F (10°C) while holding the breath",
                "Performing 30 seconds of high-intensity jumping jacks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Submerging the face (specifically the area around the eyes and nose) in cold water triggers the Mammalian Dive Reflex, which results in immediate bradycardia (lowered heart rate) and peripheral vasoconstriction via the Vagus nerve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to the study by Scullin et al. (2018) at Baylor University, which form of 'Cognitive Offloading' resulted in the fastest Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)?",
            "options": [
                "Journaling about three things the individual was grateful for that day",
                "Writing a detailed 'To-Do' list of specific tasks to be completed in the future",
                "Writing a 'Done' list of all accomplishments from the current day",
                "Free-form expressive writing about emotional stressors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that participants who wrote a to-do list of future tasks fell asleep significantly faster (up to 37% faster) than those writing about completed tasks, as it offloads the 'Zeigarnik Effect' (the tendency to remember uncompleted tasks)."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Why is the 4-7-8 breathing technique specifically effective for transitioning the body into a parasympathetic state before sleep?",
            "options": [
                "The 4-second inhale maximizes oxygen saturation in the hemoglobin",
                "The 7-second hold increases CO2 levels, which triggers the Bohr effect and calms the brain",
                "The 8-second exhale is twice as long as the inhale, stimulating the Vagus nerve via the Hering-Breuer reflex",
                "It prevents the buildup of nitric oxide in the nasal passages"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extended exhalations (longer than the inhalation) signal to the brain that the body is in a safe state, increasing vagal tone and slowing the heart rate through Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In somatic practices, what is the primary purpose of 'therapeutic shaking' or neurogenic tremors?",
            "options": [
                "To increase core body temperature before a cooling phase",
                "To manually exhaust the fast-twitch muscle fibers to induce fatigue",
                "To discharge trapped sympathetic energy and complete the 'stress response cycle'",
                "To improve lymphatic drainage through mechanical oscillation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic shaking mimics the natural mechanism animals use to discharge 'survival energy' after a stressful event, helping the human nervous system move out of a 'functional freeze' or high-arousal state."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) relies on the 'rebound effect' of relaxation. What is the physiological requirement for this to be effective?",
            "options": [
                "The tension phase must last at least 30 seconds per muscle group",
                "The muscle must be tensed to approximately 100% of maximum force",
                "The release of tension must be sudden, allowing the muscle to drop into a deeper state of relaxation than before the tension",
                "The practitioner must visualize the muscle turning into liquid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The efficacy of PMR (Jacobson's Method) lies in the contrast; by creating intentional tension and then suddenly releasing it, the brain more easily recognizes and achieves a state of deep muscular passivity."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A client presents as 'Tired but Wired'—exhausted during the day but experiencing a second wind at 9:00 PM. Which hormonal profile is most likely present?",
            "options": [
                "Low morning cortisol and high evening cortisol",
                "High morning cortisol and low evening cortisol",
                "High morning melatonin and high evening adenosine",
                "Consistently low cortisol throughout the entire 24-hour cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Tired but Wired' state is often characterized by a flattened or inverted cortisol curve, where the individual lacks the morning energy surge but experiences a maladaptive HPA-axis activation in the evening."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which anatomical structure serves as the 'pacemaker' for the circadian rhythm and is directly influenced by the stress-reduction techniques in this module?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)",
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Reticular Activating System (RAS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN in the hypothalamus regulates the timing of cortisol and melatonin. Stress mitigation techniques help prevent the amygdala from 'hijacking' the SCN's signals, maintaining a healthy sleep-wake cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended duration for a 'Brain Dump' session to ensure it provides relief without causing further rumination or 'over-analysis'?",
            "options": [
                "Exactly 60 minutes",
                "5 to 10 minutes",
                "Until every possible thought is recorded (regardless of time)",
                "Minimum of 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical evidence suggests that a brief 5-10 minute session is sufficient to offload the working memory. Longer sessions risk 'ruminative loops' where the individual begins to over-analyze the problems they are writing down."
