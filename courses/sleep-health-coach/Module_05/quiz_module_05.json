            "question": "What is the primary neurochemical mechanism by which caffeine disrupts the homeostatic sleep drive?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of melatonin in the pineal gland",
                "It acts as a competitive antagonist at adenosine A1 and A2A receptors",
                "It accelerates the clearance of GABA from the synaptic cleft",
                "It directly inhibits the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caffeine's primary effect is blocking adenosine receptors. Adenosine builds up during wakefulness to create sleep pressure; by blocking these receptors, caffeine prevents the brain from detecting this pressure."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "According to caffeine pharmacokinetics, if a client consumes 200mg of caffeine at 4:00 PM, approximately how much will remain in their system at 10:00 PM (assuming a standard 6-hour half-life)?",
            "options": [
                "25mg",
                "50mg",
                "100mg",
                "150mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The half-life of caffeine is approximately 5-6 hours. After 6 hours (from 4 PM to 10 PM), 50% of the initial dose (100mg) remains active in the bloodstream."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "How does alcohol consumption typically alter sleep architecture during the second half of the night?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a 'rebound effect' characterized by sleep fragmentation and increased REM density",
                "It induces a deep state of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) that lasts until morning",
                "It eliminates Stage 1 sleep entirely, leading to a more refreshed state",
                "It stabilizes the autonomic nervous system, lowering the heart rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As alcohol is metabolized, the body experiences a 'rebound effect' where the sympathetic nervous system activates, leading to frequent micro-awakenings and intense, fragmented REM sleep."

        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Research on nutritional timing suggests that high-glycemic index (GI) meals can decrease sleep onset latency if consumed at what time?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately before getting into bed",
                "Approximately 4 hours before bedtime",
                "Only during the breakfast window",
                "In the middle of the night during an awakening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Afaghi et al., 2007) found that high-GI meals consumed 4 hours before bed significantly shortened sleep onset latency compared to low-GI meals or meals consumed closer to bedtime."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Why is a warm bath or shower (40-42°C) recommended 90 minutes before sleep to improve sleep quality?",
            "options": [
                "It increases core body temperature and maintains it throughout the night",
                "It stimulates the release of cortisol to help with morning alertness",
                "It triggers distal vasodilation, facilitating a rapid drop in core body temperature",
                "It prevents the skin from losing moisture during the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The warm water causes blood to move to the surface of the skin (vasodilation). When the person exits the bath, this heat is dissipated, causing the core body temperature to drop, which is a biological signal for sleep."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In a 2018 study by Scullin et al., what specific 'buffer zone' activity was shown to significantly reduce sleep onset latency compared to journaling about completed tasks?",
            "options": [
                "Watching a high-intensity action movie",
                "Writing a detailed 'To-Do' list for the following days",
                "Engaging in 30 minutes of heavy weightlifting",
                "Checking work emails to ensure nothing was missed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that 'offloading' future worries by writing a specific To-Do list helped the brain relax, reducing the time it took to fall asleep compared to writing about past events."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "To maximize the benefits of a 'Power Nap' while avoiding sleep inertia, what is the recommended duration and timing?",
            "options": [
                "10-20 minutes, taken before 3:00 PM",
                "60-90 minutes, taken after 5:00 PM",
                "5 minutes, taken whenever feeling tired",
                "45 minutes, taken immediately after lunch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Short naps (10-20 mins) prevent the sleeper from entering Stage 3 (Deep Sleep), which avoids the grogginess of sleep inertia. Taking it before 3 PM ensures it doesn't interfere with the evening sleep drive."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "During a Sleep Hygiene Audit, a client reveals they exercise intensely at 9:00 PM and go to bed at 10:30 PM. Why might this be problematic for their sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "It lowers their heart rate too quickly",
                "It inhibits the production of adenosine",
                "It keeps core body temperature elevated and increases sympathetic nervous system arousal",
                "It causes an immediate drop in blood glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-intensity exercise within 1-2 hours of bed keeps the core temperature high and the nervous system in a state of 'fight or flight' (sympathetic dominance), making it difficult to transition to sleep."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Tier 1' fundamental of sleep hygiene that provides the foundation for all other behavioral interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Buying the most expensive mattress available",
                "Taking melatonin supplements daily",
                "Maintaining a consistent wake-up time 7 days a week",
                "Using a blue-light filter on a smartphone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency is the bedrock of sleep hygiene. A regular wake-up time anchors the circadian rhythm and ensures a predictable build-up of sleep pressure (adenosine) each day."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah is a 35-year-old executive who 'unwinds' with 2 glasses of wine and checks her laptop in bed. She reports waking up at 3:00 AM with a racing heart. What is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Caffeine toxicity from morning coffee",
                "The metabolic clearance of alcohol triggering sympathetic arousal",
                "A lack of Vitamin D from indoor work",
                "Her mattress is too soft, causing back pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The timing of her awakening (3:00 AM) and the 'racing heart' are classic symptoms of the alcohol rebound effect, where the sedative effects wear off and the body overcompensates with excitatory signals."
