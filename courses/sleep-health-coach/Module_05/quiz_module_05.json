            "question": "A client consumes a double espresso (approx. 200mg caffeine) at 4:00 PM. Based on the average 5-6 hour half-life of caffeine, approximately how much caffeine remains active in their system at 10:00 PM?",
            "options": [
                "25mg",
                "50mg",
                "100mg",
                "150mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Caffeine has an average half-life of 5 to 6 hours. If 200mg is consumed at 4:00 PM, approximately 50% (100mg) will still be circulating in the bloodstream at 10:00 PM, which is enough to significantly block adenosine receptors and delay sleep onset."

            "question": "Which mechanism best explains why alcohol consumption leads to fragmented sleep in the second half of the night?",
            "options": [
                "Alcohol increases core body temperature immediately upon ingestion",
                "The 'Glutamate Rebound' effect occurs as alcohol levels drop, increasing physiological arousal",
                "Alcohol enhances the production of melatonin, leading to early morning waking",
                "Alcohol shortens the first REM cycle, causing a permanent shift in circadian phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As the liver metabolizes alcohol, the initial sedative effect (GABA enhancement) wears off, leading to a 'rebound' of glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter), which causes sympathetic nervous system activation, increased heart rate, and frequent micro-awakenings."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Sleep-Wake Diet' principles, what is the primary reason for consuming high-glycemic index carbohydrates 2–4 hours before bed?",
            "options": [
                "To spike cortisol levels to ensure the body has energy for repair",
                "To lower insulin levels and promote fat oxidation during sleep",
                "To increase the ratio of tryptophan to large neutral amino acids (LNAAs), facilitating tryptophan's entry into the brain",
                "To prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia which is the leading cause of insomnia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin secretion triggered by high-GI carbs causes LNAAs to be taken up into muscle tissue, reducing competition for tryptophan at the blood-brain barrier. This allows more tryptophan to enter the brain and convert into serotonin and subsequently melatonin."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Regarding exercise timing, why is it generally recommended that vigorous aerobic activity be completed at least 2–3 hours before the desired sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the core body temperature to undergo a compensatory drop required for sleep initiation",
                "To ensure that lactic acid is fully cleared from the skeletal muscles",
                "To prevent the depletion of glycogen stores which are needed for REM sleep",
                "To allow the heart rate to drop below 40 beats per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Exercise raises core body temperature. Sleep onset is triggered by a rapid decline in core temperature. Finishing vigorous exercise 2-3 hours early allows the body to shed heat through vasodilation, facilitating the necessary thermal drop for sleep."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'tired but wired' at night. You suggest a 'Cognitive Offloading' technique. Which of the following best describes this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Watching a complex documentary to distract the brain from personal worries",
                "Performing a 'Brain Dump' or writing a detailed to-do list for the next day to reduce 'unfinished task' anxiety",
                "Engaging in high-intensity Sudoku puzzles to exhaust the prefrontal cortex",
                "Recounting the day's events in reverse order to induce mental fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Writing a to-do list or journaling (cognitive offloading) has been shown in studies (e.g., Scullin et al., 2018) to reduce sleep onset latency by offloading the 'Zeigarnik Effect'—the tendency to remember uncompleted tasks—thereby reducing pre-sleep rumination."

            "question": "What is the 'Goldilocks zone' for a daytime power nap to avoid 'Sleep Inertia' while still providing a cognitive boost?",
            "options": [
                "5–10 minutes",
                "15–25 minutes",
                "45–60 minutes",
                "90–120 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 15–25 minute nap primarily consists of Stage 1 and Stage 2 NREM sleep. Staying under 30 minutes prevents the sleeper from entering Stage 3 (Slow Wave Sleep), which is much harder to wake from and causes the grogginess known as sleep inertia."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In the context of sleep hygiene science, what does 'Process S' represent?",
            "options": [
                "The circadian rhythm regulated by the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus",
                "The secretional timing of melatonin from the pineal gland",
                "The homeostatic sleep drive that builds up based on the duration of wakefulness",
                "The sensory processing speed during REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to Borbély’s Two-Process Model, Process S is the homeostatic sleep pressure that increases the longer we stay awake (driven by adenosine accumulation) and decreases during sleep."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When conducting a Sleep Hygiene Audit, you find a client uses their bed for work, watching TV, and scrolling social media. Which principle of behavioral change are they violating?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulus Control (associating the bed only with sleep and intimacy)",
                "Sleep Restriction (limiting time in bed to actual sleep time)",
                "Cognitive Restructuring (changing thoughts about sleep)",
                "Progressive Muscle Relaxation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control therapy aims to strengthen the conditioned association between the bed/bedroom and sleep. Using the bed for wakeful, high-arousal activities weakens this association and can lead to conditioned insomnia."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Research on 'Social Jetlag' suggests that shifting sleep/wake times by more than ____ hours on weekends can significantly disrupt metabolic health and Monday morning cognitive performance.",
            "options": [
                "0.5 hours",
                "1 hour",

                "4 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Variability of more than 2 hours in sleep timing (Social Jetlag) between work days and free days is associated with higher BMI, increased inflammation, and significant 'Monday morning fogginess' due to circadian misalignment."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Sleep Hygiene' recommendation that specifically targets the suppression of melatonin?",
            "options": [
                "Keeping the room temperature at 65°F (18°C)",
                "Avoiding blue-wavelength light (450-480nm) 60-90 minutes before bed",
                "Eating a low-protein snack before sleep",
                "Using a weighted blanket to increase serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are most sensitive to blue light (approx. 450-480nm). Exposure to this light spectrum in the evening signals the SCN to suppress melatonin production, delaying the biological clock."
