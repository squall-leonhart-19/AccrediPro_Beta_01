            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), often called the 'Master Clock,' is located within which specific brain structure?",
            "options": [
                "The Pineal Gland",
                "The Hypothalamus",
                "The Pituitary Gland",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN is a tiny region of the hypothalamus situated directly above the optic chiasm, allowing it to receive direct photic input to regulate circadian rhythms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Non-image forming photic input is primarily detected by which specialized cells in the retina?",
            "options": [
                "Rods and Cones",
                "Bipolar Cells",
                "Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs)",
                "Amacrine Cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ipRGCs contain the photopigment melanopsin, which is specifically sensitive to short-wavelength blue light and transmits signals directly to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to the synthesis pathway of melatonin, which amino acid is the primary precursor that is first converted into serotonin?",
            "options": [
                "L-Theanine",
                "L-Tyrosine",
                "L-Tryptophan",
                "L-Glutamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin synthesis begins with the uptake of L-Tryptophan, which is converted to 5-HTP, then Serotonin, and finally into Melatonin via the enzymes SNAT and HIOMT."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client consistently eats a large meal at 10:00 PM. Based on the study of peripheral oscillators, how does this most likely affect their metabolic rhythm?",
            "options": [
                "It has no effect as the SCN overrides all peripheral clocks.",
                "It creates 'circadian desynchrony' by shifting the liver clock while the SCN remains fixed to light.",
                "It improves glucose tolerance by priming the pancreas for nighttime repair.",
                "It accelerates the Cortisol Awakening Response the following morning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food is a primary 'zeitgeber' (time-giver) for peripheral clocks like the liver. Late-night eating uncouples the liver's rhythm from the SCN's light-driven rhythm, leading to metabolic dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "To initiate sleep, the core body temperature must typically drop by approximately how much?",
            "options": [
                "0.2 to 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit",
                "1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit",
                "3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit",
                "Core temperature must remain static for sleep onset."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A drop in core body temperature of roughly 1-2°F (approx. 1°C) is a biological requirement for the transition into deep NREM sleep."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client wakes up at 6:00 AM on weekdays and 10:00 AM on weekends. What is their calculated 'Social Jetlag' value?",
            "options": [
                "1 hour",
                "2 hours",
                "4 hours",
                "0 hours (Social Jetlag only applies to travel)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the difference between the midpoint of sleep on workdays vs. free days. If the sleep duration is the same, the shift in wake time (4 hours) results in a 2-hour shift in the sleep midpoint."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is most effectively optimized by exposure to bright light within what timeframe after waking?",
            "options": [
                "Within the first 20-30 minutes",
                "Between 2 and 3 hours after waking",
                "Only after the sun has reached its peak (Solar Noon)",
                "Light exposure does not affect cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bright light exposure within the first 20-30 minutes of waking triggers a robust CAR, which helps set the circadian clock and improves alertness and mood throughout the day."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "For a client suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), what is the clinically recommended standard for light therapy intensity and duration?",
            "options": [
                "500 lux for 10 minutes in the evening",
                "2,500 lux for 5 hours throughout the day",
                "10,000 lux for 30 minutes in the morning",
                "10,000 lux for 30 minutes before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gold standard for SAD treatment is 10,000 lux of cool-white light for 30 minutes shortly after waking, which mimics the effect of spring/summer morning light."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Research indicates that melanopsin is most sensitive to light in which specific wavelength range?",
            "options": [
                "620–750 nm (Red light)",
                "570–590 nm (Yellow light)",

                "300–400 nm (Ultraviolet light)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melanopsin-containing ipRGCs are maximally sensitive to short-wavelength light in the blue spectrum, specifically around 460-480 nm."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which strategy is most effective for a client experiencing 'Weekend Drift' to maintain circadian alignment?",
            "options": [
                "Sleeping in on Sunday to 'bank' sleep for Monday morning.",
                "Using a high-dose melatonin supplement (10mg) on Sunday nights.",
                "Maintaining a consistent wake time within 60 minutes across all seven days.",
                "Exercising vigorously at 10:00 PM on Sunday to induce fatigue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency is the foundation of rhythm alignment. Limiting the 'drift' of wake times to within 60 minutes prevents the phase-delaying effects of social jetlag."
