            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Research into thermal regulation suggests that the 'Cool Sanctuary' protocol is effective because sleep onset is physiologically triggered by a drop in core body temperature. What is the ideal ambient temperature range for most adults to facilitate this?",
            "options": [
                "16-19°C (60-67°F)",
                "20-23°C (68-73°F)",
                "24-26°C (75-79°F)",
                "12-14°C (53-57°F)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The optimal temperature range for sleep is 16-19°C. This range supports the body's natural thermoregulation process, specifically facilitating the drop in core temperature required for NREM sleep."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A 2019 study published in PNAS demonstrated that even 'dim' light exposure during sleep can have physiological consequences. At what lux level did researchers observe increased heart rate and insulin resistance the following morning?",
            "options": [
                "5 lux",
                "100 lux",
                "500 lux",
                "1,000 lux"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that 100 lux of light (comparable to a dim hallway light) was sufficient to increase sympathetic nervous system activity and impair glucose metabolism compared to sleeping in less than 3 lux."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which specific auditory intervention is characterized by a '1/f' power spectrum, providing a consistent background that masks 'peak' noises by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio?",
            "options": [
                "White Noise",
                "Binaural Beats",
                "Pink Noise",
                "Isochronic Tones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pink Noise (1/f) has been shown in clinical studies to increase stable sleep and enhance memory consolidation by providing a more naturalistic sound masking effect than the harsher frequencies of white noise."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "During an environmental audit, you measure the CO2 levels in a client's bedroom. If levels exceed 2,000 ppm, what is the most likely impact on the client's sleep quality based on air quality research?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of night terrors",
                "Reduced sleep efficiency and decreased next-day cognitive performance",
                "Immediate onset of sleep apnea symptoms",
                "Significant increase in REM sleep duration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High CO2 concentrations in poorly ventilated bedrooms are strongly correlated with lower perceived sleep quality, increased awakenings, and objective decreases in concentration and cognitive speed the next day."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "When recommending a mattress for a client with chronic lower back pain, a meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests which level of firmness is generally superior for spinal alignment and pain reduction?",
            "options": [
                "Extra-soft (Level 1-2)",
                "Extra-firm (Level 9-10)",
                "Medium-firm (Level 6-7)",
                "Firmness does not correlate with back pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A systematic review of 24 studies found that medium-firm mattresses provide the best balance of pressure relief and support for the lumbar spine, leading to significant reductions in pain compared to very firm or soft surfaces."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "The 'Stimulus Control' protocol in sleep psychology aims to strengthen the association between the bed and sleep. Which of the following is a primary rule of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Always go to bed at exactly 10:00 PM regardless of sleepiness",
                "Use the bed only for sleep and intimacy; no work, screens, or eating",
                "If you can't sleep, stay in bed and try harder to relax",
                "Keep a television on in the background to provide 'comfort' noise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control Therapy (SCT) requires the bedroom to be 'zoned' exclusively for sleep and sex to prevent the brain from associating the environment with wakeful activities or stress."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Short-wavelength blue light (450-480nm) is highly disruptive to the circadian rhythm because it most effectively stimulates which cells in the eye?",
            "options": [
                "Rods",
                "Cones",

                "Bipolar cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ipRGCs contain the photopigment melanopsin, which is highly sensitive to blue light. These cells communicate directly with the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to suppress melatonin production."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the context of thermal regulation, what is the role of 'distal vasodilation' (warming the hands and feet) before bed?",
            "options": [
                "It increases core body temperature to prepare for sleep",
                "It traps heat in the extremities to protect the heart",
                "It facilitates the rapid shedding of core body heat to the environment",
                "It has no known effect on sleep latency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Distal vasodilation (opening of blood vessels in hands/feet) allows heat to be transferred from the core to the skin surface, lowering core temperature and significantly reducing sleep onset latency."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client lives near a busy airport and suffers from 'noise-induced sleep fragmentation.' Which intervention provides the most effective physical barrier to low-frequency sound waves?",
            "options": [
                "Standard foam earplugs",
                "A high-quality HEPA air purifier",
                "Double-pane windows or acoustic 'blackout' curtains",
                "A lavender-scented diffuser"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physical barriers like double-pane windows and mass-loaded vinyl curtains are essential for blocking low-frequency external noise (like jet engines) that earplugs or white noise machines may not fully mitigate."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A Sleep Coach is performing an environmental audit. The client's bedroom has a 'cluttered' appearance, a workstation in the corner, and several charging electronic devices on the nightstand. Which psychological concept is most likely being violated?",
            "options": [
                "The First-Night Effect",
                "Cognitive Zoning and Stimulus Control",
                "The Sleep-Stress Paradox",
                "Circadian Misalignment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A cluttered bedroom with work-related items violates 'Cognitive Zoning.' The presence of work and tech creates a 'conditioned arousal' state, making it difficult for the brain to transition into a parasympathetic 'rest' state."
