            "question": "According to the research cited in Lesson 1 (Okamoto-Mizuno, 2012), what is the generally recommended ambient temperature range for promoting optimal NREM sleep and core body temperature cooling?",
            "options": [
                "15–19°C (60–67°F)",
                "21–24°C (70–75°F)",
                "10–13°C (50–55°F)",
                "25–27°C (77–81°F)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a cooler environment facilitates the necessary drop in core body temperature. 15–19°C is considered the 'sweet spot' for most adults to maintain thermal neutrality under bedding."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Based on the 2022 consensus guidelines by Brown et al. regarding light pollution, what is the maximum recommended light level (in lux) for the sleep environment during the sleep period?",
            "options": [
                "50 lux",
                "10 lux",
                "Less than 1 lux",
                "5 lux"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To avoid even minimal melatonin suppression and circadian disruption, the sleep environment should be as close to total darkness as possible, ideally below 1 lux."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which type of auditory intervention is characterized by a '1/f' power spectrum (decreasing 3 dB per octave) and has been shown in studies to improve sleep stability by reducing the difference between background noise and peak noise?",
            "options": [
                "White Noise",
                "Pink Noise",
                "Brown Noise",
                "Binaural Beats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pink noise, which sounds like steady rain or wind, balances the frequency spectrum in a way that is highly effective at masking disruptive sounds and enhancing slow-wave sleep."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 4 (Air Quality), a study by Strøm-Tejsen et al. (2016) found that reducing CO2 levels below which threshold led to significantly improved sleep depth and next-day cognitive performance?",
            "options": [
                "2,000 ppm",
                "1,500 ppm",
                "800 ppm",
                "400 ppm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that when CO2 levels were reduced to approximately 800 ppm through improved ventilation, subjects reported better sleep quality and showed higher scores in logical reasoning tests."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "When conducting an ergonomic assessment for a side-sleeper (Lesson 5), what is the primary goal for selecting mattress firmness and pillow loft?",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing surface heat retention",
                "Maintaining a straight horizontal line of the spine",
                "Ensuring the head is elevated at a 30-degree angle",
                "Restricting all movement during the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For side sleepers, the goal is spinal alignment. This requires a mattress that allows the hips and shoulders to sink slightly while the pillow fills the gap between the ear and the mattress to keep the neck neutral."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Under the 'Stimulus Control' principles discussed in Lesson 6, what is the specific recommendation for a client who has been lying awake in bed for more than 20 minutes?",
            "options": [
                "Stay in bed and try a vigorous breathing exercise",
                "Turn on the television to distract the mind",
                "Leave the bedroom and engage in a quiet, low-light activity",
                "Check their phone for the exact time to log in a sleep diary"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control Therapy (SCT) aims to break the association between the bed and wakefulness/anxiety. Leaving the room prevents the bed from becoming a cue for frustration."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which wavelength range of light is most disruptive to the intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs) and the secretion of melatonin?",

                "630–700 nm (Red)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The melanopsin-containing ipRGCs are most sensitive to short-wavelength blue light, specifically in the 460–480 nm range."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "During a professional Environmental Audit (Lesson 8), why is it important to check for 'phantom' light sources like standby LEDs on electronics?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the room temperature significantly",
                "They emit high-frequency EMFs",
                "They can be perceived through closed eyelids and disrupt sleep architecture",
                "They are the primary cause of sleep apnea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even small pinpricks of light from LEDs can be detected through the eyelids, potentially fragmenting sleep or suppressing melatonin in sensitive individuals."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Lesson 1 discusses 'Distal Vasodilation.' How does wearing socks to bed or taking a warm bath 90 minutes before sleep actually help a client fall asleep faster?",
            "options": [
                "It raises the core body temperature and keeps it high all night",
                "It causes blood to move to the extremities, which facilitates a drop in core body temperature",
                "It prevents the body from entering REM sleep too early",
                "It increases cortisol production to prepare the body for the night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By warming the hands and feet (distal regions), blood vessels dilate, allowing heat to dissipate from the core to the environment, which triggers the sleep-onset mechanism."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Digital Detox' guidelines in Lesson 7, what is the primary psychological reason for removing smartphones from the immediate bedside environment?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the phone's battery from overheating",
                "To reduce the reach-distance for morning alarms",
                "To eliminate 'availability anxiety' and the dopamine-seeking urge to check notifications",
                "To improve the Wi-Fi signal in the rest of the house"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The mere presence of a smartphone creates a psychological 'pull' or 'availability anxiety.' Removing it from the room strengthens the stimulus control of the bedroom as a place for sleep only."
