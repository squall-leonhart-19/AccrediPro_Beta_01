            "question": "According to Spielman’s 3P Model of Insomnia discussed in Lesson 2, which of the following is categorized as a 'perpetuating factor'?",
            "options": [
                "A genetic predisposition to hyperarousal",
                "A sudden stressful life event like a job loss",
                "Spending 10 hours in bed to 'catch up' on 5 hours of sleep",
                "A history of childhood anxiety disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perpetuating factors are compensatory behaviors or thoughts (like sleep extension or napping) that maintain insomnia after the initial trigger (precipitating factor) has resolved."

            "question": "A client completes the STOP-BANG screening tool and receives a score of 6. Based on the scoring criteria in Lesson 4, how should the coach interpret this result?",
            "options": [
                "Low risk; no further action required",
                "Moderate risk; monitor for 4 weeks with a sleep diary",
                "High risk for OSA; immediate referral for a diagnostic sleep study (PSG) is required",
                "Inconclusive; the client should take the Epworth Sleepiness Scale instead"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A STOP-BANG score of 5-8 indicates a high risk for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). As this is outside the coach's scope to treat, a referral for Polysomnography (PSG) is mandatory."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 6, what is the primary limitation of using consumer-grade wearable devices (actigraphy) compared to Polysomnography (PSG)?",
            "options": [
                "Wearables cannot track movement or heart rate",
                "Wearables often overestimate total sleep time by misidentifying quiet wakefulness as sleep",
                "Wearables are more invasive and disrupt the natural sleep environment",
                "Wearables are unable to provide longitudinal data over multiple weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While actigraphy is excellent for longitudinal patterns, it lacks EEG data and often fails to distinguish between a user lying still while awake and actual sleep, leading to an overestimation of sleep duration."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a consistent sleep onset of 3:00 AM and a natural wake time of 11:00 AM. They function well if allowed this schedule but suffer significantly when forced to wake at 7:00 AM for work. Which CRSWD does this describe?",
            "options": [
                "Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder (ASPD)",

                "Shift Work Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DSPD is characterized by a significant delay in the major sleep episode relative to required social timings, typically involving a late sleep onset and difficulty waking early."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "URGE stands for: Upper airway (not applicable), Rest/inactivity triggers it, Gets better with movement, and Evening/night-time worsening."

                "Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)",
                "GAD-7 Anxiety Scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ESS is the validated standard for measuring daytime sleepiness. A score above 10 indicates significant sleepiness that requires clinical investigation."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "During an assessment, a client's partner reports that the client 'acts out dreams' by punching and kicking in their sleep, often causing injury. Which condition is most likely and requires a referral?",
            "options": [
                "NREM Sleepwalking",
                "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)",
                "Sleep Terrors",
                "Benign Sleep Myoclonus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RBD involves the loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep, allowing patients to act out vivid, often violent dreams. This is a red flag as it is highly correlated with neurodegenerative diseases."

                "Withhold coaching on sleep hygiene and refer immediately to a sleep physician"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Coaches cannot diagnose. When high-risk physical markers and 'gasping' (a major red flag) are present, the coach must refer the client to a medical professional before proceeding with behavioral interventions."
