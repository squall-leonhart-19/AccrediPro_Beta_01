            "question": "During a typical 90-minute sleep cycle, which stage is characterized by 'sleep spindles' and 'K-complexes' on an EEG, representing the transition into deeper sleep?",
            "options": [
                "N1 (Stage 1)",
                "N2 (Stage 2)",
                "N3 (Stage 3/Slow Wave Sleep)",
                "REM Sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N2 sleep accounts for approximately 50% of total sleep time in adults and is characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes, which are thought to protect sleep from external arousal."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Research into the glymphatic system indicates that during sleep, the interstitial space between brain cells increases by what percentage to facilitate the clearance of metabolic waste?",
            "options": [
                "20%",
                "40%",
                "60%",
                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A landmark study (Xie et al., 2013) demonstrated that the interstitial space increases by 60% during sleep, significantly increasing the convective flow of cerebrospinal fluid to flush out neurotoxins like amyloid-beta."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Adenosine is a primary driver of 'homeostatic sleep pressure.' How does caffeine consumption affect this biological process?",
            "options": [
                "It accelerates the production of adenosine in the basal forebrain.",
                "It acts as a competitive antagonist, binding to adenosine receptors without activating them.",
                "It destroys existing adenosine molecules in the bloodstream.",
                "It stimulates the pineal gland to release melatonin prematurely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist. It blocks the receptors, preventing the brain from sensing the accumulated adenosine, though the adenosine continues to build up in the background."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client presents with intense sugar cravings and increased appetite after only five hours of sleep. Physiologically, this is most likely due to which hormonal shift?",

                "Increased Melatonin and increased Insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation leads to a 'metabolic double-whammy': Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) increases, while Leptin (the satiety hormone) decreases, leading to increased caloric intake and cravings for high-carbohydrate foods."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that 24 hours of total sleep deprivation results in cognitive psychomotor performance equivalent to a BAC of 0.10%, which is above the legal driving limit in most jurisdictions."

            "id": "q1_6",

            "options": [
                "Group huddling maintained body temperature during the ice age.",
                "Asynchronous sleep patterns ensured at least one person was usually awake to monitor for predators.",
                "REM sleep is only possible when a 'leader' is awake to protect the tribe.",
                "Shared dreaming was necessary for tribal social cohesion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sentinel Hypothesis posits that staggered sleep schedules in hunter-gatherer groups ensured that for the vast majority of the night, at least one individual was awake or in a light stage of sleep to provide protection."

            "id": "q1_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data from various studies show a 24% spike in heart attacks on the Monday following the loss of just one hour of sleep during the spring time change, highlighting the fragility of cardiovascular health in relation to sleep."

                "Sleep increases the thickness of the skin at the injection site.",
                "Sleep deprivation suppresses the production of antigen-specific T-cells and reduces antibody response.",
                "Melatonin directly attacks the viral proteins in the vaccine.",
                "The glymphatic system transports the vaccine to the brain faster."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that individuals who sleep less than 6 hours the night after a vaccination produce significantly fewer antibodies, as sleep is critical for the proliferation of T-cells and the formation of immunological memory."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "During which stage of sleep does the body experience 'atonia' (temporary muscle paralysis), and what is its primary biological purpose?",
            "options": [
                "N3; to allow for deep tissue repair without movement.",
                "REM; to prevent the individual from physically acting out dreams.",
                "N1; to signal the brain that the body is ready for rest.",
                "N2; to lower the heart rate to its minimum level."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During REM sleep, the brain sends signals down the spinal cord to paralyze major voluntary muscles (atonia), which serves as a safety mechanism to prevent physical injury during vivid dreaming."

                "Feeling tired only when in large groups of people.",
                "The inability to sleep in a hotel or unfamiliar environment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the shift in sleep timing between work days and free days. Even a 2-hour difference can lead to metabolic disruption, increased BMI, and chronic fatigue, similar to crossing time zones every week."
