            "options": [
                "Predisposing factors (e.g., genetics)",
                "Precipitating factors (e.g., a stressful life event)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While precipitating factors trigger the initial sleep loss, perpetuating factors—such as spending excessive time in bed or worrying about sleep—are what maintain insomnia long after the initial stressor has resolved."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because actigraphy relies on movement, patients with insomnia who lie still but are awake are often misidentified as 'asleep' by the device, leading to an overestimation of total sleep time."
