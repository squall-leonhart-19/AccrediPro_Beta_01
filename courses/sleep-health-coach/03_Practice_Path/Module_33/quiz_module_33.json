            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep coaches must stay within their scope of practice. Identifying behavioral patterns is educational; diagnosing conditions like OSA or prescribing/adjusting medical treatments (like CPAP or specific dosages for disorders) is practicing medicine without a license."

                "There is no legal way to limit liability in a coaching contract.",
                "Liability is capped at the coach's total net worth."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most professional service agreements cap liability at the total fees paid by the client, which protects the coach's business from catastrophic financial loss beyond the scope of the engagement."

            "id": "q33_8",
