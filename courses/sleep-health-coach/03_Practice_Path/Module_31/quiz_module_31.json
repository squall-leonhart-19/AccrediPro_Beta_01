            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Premium positioning is achieved by moving away from commodity-based hourly billing and toward a proprietary system (D.R.E.A.M.) that promises a specific, high-value transformation."

                "It allows the coach to work more hours for the same amount of money",
                "It decouples the coach's income from their time and focuses on the ROI of sleep restoration",
                "It makes the service more affordable for clients who only want a single tip",
                "It follows the standard medical model of 15-minute consultations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket architecture focuses on the lifetime value of improved sleep (health ROI), allowing coaches to charge for the outcome rather than the minutes spent on a call."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Medical professionals are often time-poor; a sleep coach provides value by handling the 'heavy lifting' of behavioral change (CBT-I based strategies) that doctors cannot fit into 10-minute appointments."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
