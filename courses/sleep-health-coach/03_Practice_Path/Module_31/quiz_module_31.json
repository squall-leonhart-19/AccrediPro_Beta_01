            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on pharmacological interventions for insomnia.",
                "It utilizes a multi-dimensional, evidence-based framework (Diet, Relaxation, Environment, Activity, Mindset) rather than isolated tips.",
                "It is the only method that guarantees 8 hours of sleep in the first 48 hours.",
                "It relies solely on wearable technology data to dictate client behavior."
            ],

            "explanation": "The D.R.E.A.M. Sleep Method™ is a holistic, integrated framework that addresses the root causes of sleep disruption across five key pillars, moving beyond the 'generic tips' found in low-ticket or free content."

            "options": [
                "Hourly billing makes the coach seem more professional to medical peers.",
                "Value-based pricing allows the coach to work more hours with fewer clients.",
                "It shifts the focus from 'time spent' to the 'transformational outcome' and ROI of improved health and productivity.",
                "Most insurance companies only reimburse value-based coaching models."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket coaching (e.g., $2,500+) is justified by the profound impact sleep has on a client's life, career, and longevity, rather than the number of minutes spent on a Zoom call."

                "Up to 45% compared to non-cited content",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that evidence-based content with peer-reviewed citations increases authority and trust by approximately 45%, as it distinguishes the practitioner from 'influencers' who lack scientific backing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The COI helps the client realize that the price of the program is lower than the long-term cost of poor health, lost productivity, and strained relationships caused by sleep deprivation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
