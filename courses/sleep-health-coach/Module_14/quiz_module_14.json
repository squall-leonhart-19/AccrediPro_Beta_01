            "question": "The glymphatic system's waste clearance efficiency is significantly enhanced during Slow-Wave Sleep (N3). Which physiological mechanism is primarily responsible for this increase in fluid flux?",
            "options": [
                "The expansion of the interstitial space by approximately 60% driven by astrocytic shrinkage",
                "The increase in heart rate variability (HRV) during REM sleep",
                "The constriction of the perivascular space to increase pressure",
                "The activation of the sympathetic nervous system to flush neurotoxins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that during N3 sleep, the interstitial space in the brain expands by roughly 60%, facilitated by astrocytic changes and AQP4 water channels, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic waste like beta-amyloid."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms and a flattened Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Based on the Endocrine Axis lesson, what does a CAR increase of less than 35% typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal HPA axis flexibility",
                "Acute short-term stress recovery",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-50% increase in cortisol within 30-45 minutes of waking. A blunted or flattened response is a hallmark of HPA axis dysfunction and chronic stress exhaustion."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "The Gut-Sleep-Brain axis relies heavily on microbial metabolites. Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially influence sleep by modulating GABAergic signaling?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a primary SCFA produced by gut microbiota that has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and exert neuroprotective and sleep-promoting effects via GABAergic pathways."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Advanced Chronobiology, what is the recommended maximum 'Melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance' (m-EDI) for the sleep environment to avoid circadian disruption?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current expert consensus (e.g., Brown et al., 2022) recommends that the melanopic EDI should be less than 10 lux in the two hours before bedtime and less than 1 lux during the sleep period."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging is characterized by a significant reduction in Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) and the density/amplitude of sleep spindles, which are critical for the 'active systems consolidation' of memories."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Research into the bidirectional link between chronic pain and sleep suggests that the relationship is asymmetrical. Which of the following statements is true regarding this link?",
            "options": [
                "Pain is a stronger predictor of the next night's sleep than sleep is of the next day's pain",
                "Sleep quality is a stronger and more reliable predictor of next-day pain sensitivity than vice versa",
                "Pain and sleep have no statistical correlation in clinical trials",
                "Chronic pain only affects REM sleep, leaving N3 sleep intact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Finan et al., 2013) demonstrate that sleep disturbances are often a more robust predictor of pain levels the following day than pain is of sleep quality, highlighting the 'pro-nociceptive' effect of sleep deprivation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-blockers can inhibit the enzyme N-acetyltransferase, which is required for melatonin synthesis, leading to lower nocturnal melatonin levels and disrupted sleep/vivid dreams."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic use of light (circadian phase shifting) is the most powerful tool for 'anchoring' the body clock to a new time zone, utilizing the Phase Response Curve (PRC) to advance or delay the rhythm."
