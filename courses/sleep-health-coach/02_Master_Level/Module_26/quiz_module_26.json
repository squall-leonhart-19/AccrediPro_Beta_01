            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "In the D.R.E.A.M. Sleep Method™ architecture, what does the 'A' specifically target to ensure long-term sleep maintenance?",
            "options": ["Atmospheric conditions and bedroom temperature", "Arousal Regulation and Autonomic Nervous System balance", "Alcohol and Caffeine metabolism timing", "Activity levels and sedentary behavior reduction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' stands for Arousal Regulation, focusing on down-regulating the sympathetic nervous system and managing the 'tired but wired' state through autonomic nervous system balance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "When designing a Tier 3 High-Ticket Coaching model ($3,000+), what is the recommended frequency for 'High-Touch' bio-individual data reviews?",
            "options": ["Once per month via email summary", "Bi-weekly via group Q&A sessions", "Weekly 1-on-1 deep dives with wearable data integration", "Daily text message check-ins only"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket models justify their ROI through intensive, data-driven 1-on-1 support, typically requiring weekly deep dives into the client's specific biometrics and progress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During the Advanced Intake protocol, a client scores a 15 on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). How should this impact your program design?",
            "options": ["It indicates 'Subthreshold insomnia' and requires no modification", "It indicates 'Clinical insomnia (moderate severity)' and requires a medical co-management approach", "It indicates 'Severe clinical insomnia' and the client must be rejected", "It is a normal score for most coaching clients"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An ISI score of 15-21 represents moderate clinical insomnia. While coaches can work with these clients, professional scope management dictates ensuring they are also cleared by or co-managed with a medical professional."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "A 2023 study on wearable validity (n=450) suggested that for a device to be useful in coaching for REM tracking, it should maintain a correlation coefficient (r) of at least:",
            "options": ["0.40", "0.55", "0.70", "0.99"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of 0.70 or higher is generally considered the benchmark for a wearable device to be clinically relevant and reliable enough for behavioral coaching interventions."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In Behavioral Change Design, which 'Habit Architecture' technique involves linking a new sleep-promoting behavior to an existing, non-negotiable daily anchor?",
            "options": ["Implementation Intentions", "Habit Stacking", "Variable Reinforcement", "Cognitive Reframing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit Stacking is the process of pairing a new habit (e.g., 5 minutes of breathwork) with a current habit (e.g., brushing teeth) to increase the likelihood of adherence."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "When developing a 'Specialized Track' for Shift Workers, what is the primary biological challenge the curriculum must address first?",
            "options": ["Social isolation and family dynamics", "Circadian Dyssynchrony and 'Social Jetlag'", "High caffeine consumption during the night shift", "Vitamin D deficiency from lack of sunlight"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all factors are relevant, Circadian Dyssynchrony is the fundamental physiological hurdle that shift workers face, requiring specific 'Anchor Sleep' and light management protocols."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "According to adult learning principles (Andragogy) discussed in Lesson 7, what is the 'Goldilocks' duration for micro-learning video modules to maximize retention?",
            "options": ["2-3 minutes", "6-12 minutes", "20-30 minutes", "45-60 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that learner engagement drops significantly after 12 minutes; therefore, 6-12 minutes is the ideal window for delivering complex sleep science in digestible bites."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "A client (Sarah, 42) shows a 15% increase in Deep Sleep over 6 weeks, which correlates with a 20% reduction in 'Brain Fog' scores. This data represents which type of ROI?",
            "options": ["Hard ROI (Financial)", "Soft ROI (Subjective/Performance)", "Clinical ROI (Diagnostic)", "Direct ROI (Refund prevention)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soft ROI refers to improvements in quality of life, cognitive performance, and subjective well-being that, while not immediately financial, are high-value drivers for client retention."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "Your client presents with a STOP-BANG score of 6. What is the mandatory professional protocol for a Sleep Health Coach?",
            "options": ["Begin intensive mouth-tape training immediately", "Suggest a high-dose melatonin protocol", "Refer the client to a sleep physician for a formal OSA evaluation", "Increase the intensity of their exercise program"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A STOP-BANG score of 5-8 indicates a high risk for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Coaches must refer these clients to medical professionals as treating OSA is outside the coaching scope of practice."

        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "When scaling a coaching business, why is 'Professional Scope Management' considered a risk-mitigation strategy?",
            "options": ["It allows you to charge more for specialized services", "It prevents legal liability and ensures client safety by avoiding 'pseudo-medical' advice", "It reduces the amount of time spent on each client", "It automates the intake process through AI"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scope management is critical for scaling because it clearly defines what the coach does and does not do, protecting the practitioner from liability and ensuring clients receive appropriate medical care when needed."
