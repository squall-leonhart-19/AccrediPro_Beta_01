            "question": "In the D.R.E.A.M. Sleep Method™ framework, what does the 'R' specifically address to ensure long-term circadian entrainment?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid Eye Movement (REM) optimization through supplementation",
                "Rhythmic Alignment of light exposure and meal timing",
                "Restorative environment temperature controls",
                "Respiratory efficiency and CO2 tolerance training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the D.R.E.A.M. framework stands for Rhythmic Alignment, focusing on the synchronization of zeitgebers like light, food, and movement to stabilize the master biological clock."

            "question": "When designing a 'High-Ticket' coaching model ($3,000 - $5,000+), what is the primary value driver that justifies the price point over a standard 1-on-1 package?",
            "options": [
                "The number of hours spent in live Zoom sessions",
                "Access to a larger library of pre-recorded video content",
                "The speed and certainty of the specific health outcome (e.g., reversing chronic insomnia)",
                "The inclusion of physical products like weighted blankets and eye masks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket programs are 'outcome-based' rather than 'time-based.' Clients pay for the expertise, specialized protocol, and the high probability of achieving a specific, life-changing result efficiently."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During the Advanced Intake & Bio-Individual Assessment, a client presents with a 'Social Jetlag' score of 2.5 hours. What does this statistic primarily indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client is getting 2.5 hours less sleep than they need per night",
                "The discrepancy between the mid-point of sleep on work days versus free days",
                "The time it takes for the client to reach deep sleep after sleep onset",
                "The amount of time the client spends in blue light before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the shift in sleep timing between work days and free days. A discrepancy of >2 hours is linked to metabolic dysfunction and chronic fatigue, requiring specific habit architecture to bridge the gap."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When integrating wearable data (e.g., Oura, WHOOP) into program design, how should a coach interpret a consistent 20% drop in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during the follicular phase of a female client's cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a need for higher intensity aerobic exercise",
                "It is a sign of impending illness or overtraining regardless of the cycle",
                "It should be cross-referenced with body temperature to assess sympathetic nervous system strain",
                "It is a normal physiological response to progesterone elevation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data-driven coaching requires looking at the 'trend' rather than isolated points. A significant drop in HRV indicates the body is under stress; cross-referencing with temperature helps differentiate between cycle-related changes and actual systemic strain."

                "Reading a book about the benefits of journaling to increase motivation",
                "Increasing the duration of the journaling session to 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking uses an existing, automated anchor (brushing teeth) to trigger the new behavior. This reduces the cognitive load and reliance on willpower, as per the BJ Fogg and James Clear models."

            "id": "q26_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prophylactic napping is a evidence-based strategy for shift workers to reduce the sleep pressure (adenosine) build-up before entering a period of forced wakefulness during their biological night."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "According to Curriculum Design principles, why should a Sleep Coach use 'Scaffolding' when delivering client resources?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client receives all 50+ sleep tips in the first week",
                "To prevent 'Cognitive Overload' by building on foundational concepts before introducing advanced bio-hacks",
                "To make the program look longer and more expensive",
                "To avoid having to update the curriculum frequently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding ensures that clients master basic behaviors (like light management) before moving to complex ones (like temperature cycling or advanced supplementation), which increases adherence and self-efficacy."

            "id": "q26_8",

                "Suggest the client take 5-HTP to improve their breathing during sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A STOP-BANG score of 5 indicates a high risk for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Coaches must refer clients to medical professionals for diagnosis, as treating OSA is outside the coaching scope of practice."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "In a corporate sleep program case study, 'Presenteeism' is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The total number of days an employee is absent from work due to fatigue",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Presenteeism is a major ROI metric. Research shows sleep-deprived employees are physically present but lose significant productivity, costing companies an average of $1,967 per employee annually."

            "id": "q26_10",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on who the client becomes, not just what they do. When a client shifts their identity to someone who 'prioritizes recovery,' the behaviors become self-sustaining without external coaching."
