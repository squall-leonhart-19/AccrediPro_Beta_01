            "question": "During an advanced clinical interview, a client describes an irresistible urge to move their legs that worsens in the evening and is temporarily relieved by movement. Which condition should the Master Practitioner prioritize for differential referral?",
            "options": [
                "Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD)",
                "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)",
                "Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)",
                "Shift Work Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RLS is characterized by the sensory-motor urge to move, whereas PLMD involves involuntary movements during sleep. RLS is a clinical diagnosis based on the symptoms described."

            "question": "Molecular chronobiology research indicates that melanopsin-containing Retinal Ganglion Cells (mRGCs) are most sensitive to which specific wavelength of light for suppressing melatonin secretion?",
            "options": [
                "380-420 nm (Violet)",
                "460-480 nm (Blue)",
                "520-550 nm (Green)",
                "620-750 nm (Red)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The peak sensitivity of the circadian system (mRGCs) is approximately 480 nm. Exposure to this wavelength in the evening significantly delays the Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO)."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When bio-optimizing the sleep sanctuary, what is the scientifically recommended ambient temperature range to facilitate the necessary drop in core body temperature for Stage 3 NREM sleep?",
            "options": [
                "60°F - 63°F (15.5°C - 17.2°C)",
                "65°F - 68°F (18.3°C - 20°C)",

                "74°F - 76°F (23.3°C - 24.4°C)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that 65°F (18.3°C) is ideal for most adults. Temperatures significantly higher than this can inhibit the thermoregulatory 'dip' required for deep sleep."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A client's functional lab work shows a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), characterized by less than a 50% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. This most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Acute short-term stress response",
                "Early-stage HPA-axis hyper-reactivity",
                "Chronic HPA-axis exhaustion or 'burnout' phase",
                "Normal circadian rhythm synchronization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust CAR (typically a 50-75% increase) is a sign of HPA-axis health. A blunted response is often associated with chronic stress, burnout, and poor morning alertness."

            "question": "In the context of Psychological Flexibility (ACT), what is the 'Sleep Effort' paradox?",
            "options": [
                "The more a client tries to control sleep, the more physiological arousal increases, preventing sleep.",
                "The more sleep a client gets, the more tired they feel the next day.",
                "Physical exercise late in the day improves sleep quality through exhaustion.",
                "Strict adherence to sleep hygiene always results in immediate sleep improvement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sleep is an autonomous process. 'Sleep effort'—the conscious attempt to force sleep—triggers the sympathetic nervous system, creating a state of hyperarousal that is incompatible with sleep onset."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "When interpreting biometric data from a wearable device, which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is considered the most reliable indicator of parasympathetic 'rest and digest' activity during sleep?",
            "options": [
                "SDNN (Standard deviation of NN intervals)",
                "LF/HF Ratio",
                "RMSSD (Root mean square of successive differences)",
                "Total Power"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the primary time-domain metric used to assess short-term changes in HRV and is highly reflective of vagal (parasympathetic) tone during the night."

                "High-intensity exercise at 10:00 PM local time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To advance the clock (shift earlier for eastward travel), the athlete needs light in the biological morning and melatonin in the biological afternoon/evening to pull the rhythm forward."

            "id": "q24_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches provide education and lifestyle recommendations. They do not diagnose, manage medications, or treat clinical mental health conditions independently."

                "Excessive REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A normal nocturnal dip is 10-20%. A dip of less than 10% (non-dipping) is a marker of incomplete recovery, high sympathetic load, or potential cardiovascular issues."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Based on the Mah et al. (2011) study on 'Sleep Banking' in Stanford basketball players, increasing sleep duration to 10 hours per night resulted in:",
            "options": [
                "No change in athletic performance but improved mood.",
                "Significant improvements in shooting accuracy and sprint times.",
                "Decreased reaction time due to 'sleep drunkenness' (sleep inertia).",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that 'sleep extension' or banking sleep significantly improved specific athletic performance markers, including a 9% increase in free-throw and 3-point accuracy."
