            "question": "During an advanced clinical interview, a client describes an irresistible urge to move their legs that worsens during evening rest and is temporarily relieved by walking. Which differential diagnosis is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD)",
                "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)",
                "Sleep-Related Leg Cramps",
                "Peripheral Neuropathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RLS is a clinical diagnosis characterized by the urge to move, worsening at rest, worsening in the evening, and relief with movement. PLMD is a polysomnographic finding of actual movement, not necessarily the subjective urge."

        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the Phase Response Curve (PRC), at what biological time is light exposure most effective for inducing a significant Phase Advance (shifting the clock earlier)?",
            "options": [
                "2 hours before the core body temperature minimum (Tmin)",
                "Immediately following the core body temperature minimum (Tmin)",
                "During the mid-afternoon 'post-prandial dip'",
                "At the onset of the biological night (Dim Light Melatonin Onset)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light exposure immediately following the Tmin (usually 2-3 hours before natural wake-up) produces the strongest phase advance. Light before Tmin produces a phase delay."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Bio-Optimization of the Sleep Sanctuary,' research indicates that a room temperature exceeding 24°C (75°F) primarily interferes with sleep by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the duration of N3 (Deep Sleep)",
                "Decreasing sleep latency through vasodilation",
                "Suppressing the natural nocturnal drop in core body temperature",
                "Increasing the secretion of endogenous melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High ambient temperatures prevent the necessary 1°C drop in core body temperature required for deep sleep initiation and maintenance, often leading to increased wakefulness and fragmented REM."

        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A client's biometric data shows a blunted Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). In Neuro-Endocrine integration, this is often a marker for:",
            "options": [
                "Acute, high-intensity sympathetic nervous system activation",
                "Chronic HPA-axis exhaustion or burnout",
                "Optimal circadian alignment and recovery",
                "Excessive blue light exposure in the evening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR should show a 35-60% increase in cortisol within 30-45 minutes of waking. A blunted or flat CAR is frequently associated with chronic stress, burnout, and systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "The 'Sleep Effort' paradox in Psychological Flexibility suggests that which of the following behaviors is most likely to perpetuate chronic insomnia?",
            "options": [
                "Accepting wakefulness without judgment",
                "Practicing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)",
                "Implementing 'trying harder' to fall asleep through strict mental control",
                "Adhering to a consistent wake-up time regardless of sleep duration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep is an involuntary process. 'Sleep effort'—the conscious attempt to force sleep—increases autonomic arousal, which is physiologically incompatible with sleep onset."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "When interpreting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) for a high-performance athlete, a significant drop in the RMSSD metric compared to their 7-day baseline most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system",
                "Effective recovery and readiness for high-intensity training",

                "Improved cardiovascular efficiency and stroke volume"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) is a primary marker of parasympathetic activity. A drop indicates sympathetic dominance, suggesting the athlete has not recovered from the previous load."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "For an executive traveling Eastward across 6 time zones, what is the generally accepted rate of circadian re-entrainment without advanced interventions?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 days per time zone",
                "1 day per time zone",
                "1.5 days per time zone",
                "2 days per time zone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard chronobiological guidelines suggest the body adjusts to Eastward travel at a rate of approximately 1 day per time zone crossed, whereas Westward travel is slightly faster (approx. 1.5 time zones per day)."

        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "A Master Sleep Coach notices a client exhibiting signs of 'orthosomnia'—an unhealthy obsession with achieving perfect wearable data. What is the most appropriate ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend a more expensive, medical-grade wearable for better accuracy",
                "Ignore the data and focus exclusively on the client's subjective sleep diary",
                "Educate the client on the limitations of wearables and consider a 'device holiday'",
                "Diagnose the client with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches should address the psychological impact of data tracking. If the tracking itself causes anxiety (orthosomnia), the coach should facilitate a shift in perspective or a break from the device. Diagnosing OCD is outside the scope of practice."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Executive A,' which intervention was used to mitigate the 'First Night Effect' during frequent hotel stays?",
            "options": [
                "Using a portable white noise machine and bringing a familiar pillow scent",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to 400mg in the late afternoon",
                "Engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 9:00 PM",
                "Taking 5mg of Melatonin immediately upon arrival regardless of time zone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'First Night Effect' involves one hemisphere of the brain staying more alert in new environments. Using familiar sensory cues (scent, sound) helps signal safety to the brain, reducing this hyper-vigilance."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "A 2020 validation study (n=120) comparing consumer wearables to Polysomnography (PSG) found that while total sleep time (TST) was relatively accurate, most wearables tend to:",
            "options": [
                "Underestimate Light Sleep (N1/N2)",
                "Overestimate Deep Sleep (N3) and struggle with REM/Wake distinctions",
                "Perfectly track sleep architecture with 99% specificity",
                "Fail to detect any heart rate variability (HRV)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most consumer wearables use PPG and accelerometry, which often struggle to distinguish between quiet wakefulness and N1/REM, and frequently overestimate N3 (Deep Sleep) by misinterpreting low movement and low heart rate."
