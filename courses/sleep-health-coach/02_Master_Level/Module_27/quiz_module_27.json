            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "For first responders and shift workers, what is the primary purpose of the 'Anchor Sleep' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the individual sleeps at least 8 hours in one block",
                "To maintain a consistent 4-hour overlap of sleep during the same time period every day",
                "To use caffeine only during the 'anchor' hours of the shift",
                "To prevent any sleep during daylight hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves keeping a consistent 4-hour block of sleep at the same time every 24 hours (e.g., 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM) to help stabilize the circadian rhythm despite rotating shifts."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In pediatric sleep development, at what approximate age does the biological clock (circadian rhythm) typically begin to consolidate and respond to light-dark cues?",
            "options": [
                "Birth to 2 weeks",
                "3 to 6 months",

                "18 to 24 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While newborns have polyphasic sleep, the circadian rhythm and melatonin production typically begin to consolidate and align with environmental light cues between 3 and 6 months of age."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Geriatric clients often experience 'Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome' (ASPS). Which physiological change is the primary driver of this condition?",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in REM sleep density",
                "An earlier evening rise in melatonin and core body temperature nadir",
                "A complete cessation of growth hormone production",
                "Increased sensitivity to blue light in the morning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ASPS in older adults is characterized by an earlier shift in the circadian clock, leading to early evening sleepiness and early morning awakening, driven by earlier timing of melatonin release."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, why do many women report increased sleep fragmentation and 'insomnia-like' symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "A drop in progesterone leading to hyper-arousal",
                "An increase in core body temperature (~0.5°C) which inhibits deep sleep onset",
                "A sudden surge in cortisol at midnight",
                "Excessive REM sleep suppressing Stage 3 NREM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rise in progesterone following ovulation increases core body temperature, which can interfere with the body's ability to reach the thermoregulation required for deep, restorative sleep."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Studies indicate that 50-80% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) suffer from sleep issues. What is a common neurobiological factor identified in this population?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive endogenous melatonin production",
                "Irregularities in the melatonin synthesis pathway and lower overnight melatonin levels",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that many individuals with ASD have lower levels of melatonin metabolites and irregularities in the circadian genes that regulate the sleep-wake cycle."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In the context of chronic pain, what does the 'bidirectional relationship' imply for sleep coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Pain must be eliminated before sleep can improve",
                "Sleep deprivation is actually a stronger predictor of next-day pain than pain is of sleep quality",
                "Coaching should focus only on psychological pain management",
                "Sleep and pain are unrelated in clinical settings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence shows that while pain disturbs sleep, poor sleep quality is a more potent predictor of increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) the following day, making sleep a primary intervention for pain management."

            "options": [
                "The body adapts instantly with high-intensity exercise",
                "Allow 1 day of recovery for every 1 time zone crossed",
                "The body adapts 3 times zones per day when traveling East",
                "Travel should always occur exactly 24 hours before the event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard physiological guideline for eastward travel is that the body requires approximately one day per time zone crossed to fully realign the circadian rhythm."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT-I has been shown to be highly effective for menopausal insomnia, even when hot flashes are present, by addressing the conditioned arousal associated with waking up mid-flush."
