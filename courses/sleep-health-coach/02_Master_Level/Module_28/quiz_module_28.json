            "explanation": "Command hallucinations are a psychiatric emergency and a sign of acute crisis that falls outside the scope of coaching, requiring immediate medical/psychiatric intervention."

                "It has no measurable effect on pain thresholds",
                "It increases the 'descending inhibition' of pain",
                "It induces hyperalgesia, lowering the threshold at which a stimulus is perceived as painful",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep loss facilitates central sensitization, leading to hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) and making chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia more difficult to manage."
