            "question": "During a triage assessment, a client reveals they have been using alcohol to 'knock themselves out' and expresses feelings of hopelessness regarding their chronic insomnia. Which 'Red Flag' requires immediate clinical referral according to the Crisis Triage protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While alcohol use is a concern, hopelessness combined with sleep deprivation is a high-risk indicator for suicidality. Per L1, acute crises involving safety risks require immediate referral to emergency services or mental health professionals."
