            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which neurobiological marker is most characteristic of Stage 2 (N2) sleep and is essential for memory consolidation and protecting the brain from waking due to external stimuli?",
            "options": [
                "Delta waves (0.5–4 Hz)",
                "Sleep spindles and K-complexes",
                "Alpha rhythms (8–13 Hz)",
                "Sawtooth waves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep spindles and K-complexes are the hallmark of N2 sleep. Spindles are associated with the integration of new information into existing knowledge, while K-complexes help suppress cortical arousal in response to non-threatening external stimuli."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Research on non-photic zeitgebers suggests that meal timing significantly influences peripheral clocks. According to the module, what is the primary risk of late-night 'nocturnal' eating?",
            "options": [
                "Increased melatonin production",
                "Phase advancement of the SCN",
                "Circadian misalignment between the central clock and metabolic organs (liver/pancreas)",
                "Enhanced glymphatic clearance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Late-night eating creates a 'decoupling' effect where the central master clock (SCN) remains synced to light, but peripheral metabolic clocks in the liver and pancreas shift, leading to impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that restricting sleep to 4 hours for just one night can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately:",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",
                "25-30%",
                "50-60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even short-term sleep deprivation has a profound impact on metabolic health, with studies showing a 25-30% reduction in insulin sensitivity, effectively placing a healthy individual in a pre-diabetic metabolic state."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In the context of CBT-I for coaches, what is the 'Gold Standard' recommendation for a client who has been lying awake in bed for more than 20 minutes unable to sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Try harder to relax using deep breathing in bed",
                "Use a blue-light filtering tablet to read an e-book",
                "Implement Stimulus Control by leaving the bedroom and returning only when sleepy",
                "Perform high-intensity exercise to tire the body out"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control aims to break the conditioned association between the bed and wakefulness/anxiety. Leaving the room prevents the bed from becoming a cue for frustration."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "When analyzing wearable data, a Sleep Coach notices a client's Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has trended downward significantly over three days while their Resting Heart Rate (RHR) has increased. What is the most likely coaching interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The client is entering a state of high parasympathetic dominance",
                "The client is experiencing systemic stress, overtraining, or an impending illness",
                "The client's glymphatic system is over-active",
                "The client is successfully adapting to a new sleep schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A simultaneous drop in HRV and rise in RHR typically indicates that the sympathetic nervous system is overactive, signaling poor recovery, high stress, or the onset of the 'flu' or other illness."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "The glymphatic system clears metabolic waste (such as Beta-Amyloid) from the brain. During which stage of sleep is this system most active, and by how much does the interstitial space increase?",
            "options": [
                "REM sleep; 20% increase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is most active during N3 (Deep Sleep). Research by Nedergaard et al. demonstrated that the interstitial space in the brain increases by 60% during sleep to facilitate the flushing of neurotoxins."

                "Tapering a client off their prescribed antidepressant to improve REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches may provide evidence-based education on supplements and their mechanisms, but they must never diagnose medical conditions or prescribe/alter medications."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the Mah et al. (2011) case study on Stanford basketball players, what was the primary outcome of 'Sleep Extension' (aiming for 10 hours of sleep per night)?",
            "options": [
                "Decreased reaction time but no change in accuracy",
                "Significant improvement in free-throw and 3-point field goal accuracy",

                "Reduction in total REM sleep duration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study showed that increasing sleep duration led to a 9% increase in both free-throw and 3-point accuracy, highlighting the role of sleep in fine motor skills and athletic performance."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "How does sleep deprivation affect the hormonal regulation of appetite (the 'Hormonal Feedback Loop')?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Leptin (satiety) and decreases Ghrelin (hunger)",
                "It decreases both Leptin and Ghrelin",
                "It decreases Leptin (satiety) and increases Ghrelin (hunger)",
                "It has no effect on these hormones; it only affects insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep restriction leads to lower levels of leptin (the signal to stop eating) and higher levels of ghrelin (the signal to start eating), creating a biological drive for overconsumption."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client spends 9 hours in bed but only sleeps for 6.5 hours. What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE) percentage, and is this considered 'healthy'?",
            "options": [
                "85%; Yes, it is healthy",
                "72%; No, it is below the 85% clinical threshold",
                "92%; Yes, it is excellent",
                "65%; No, it is below the 50% clinical threshold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) x 100. (6.5 / 9) x 100 = 72.2%. A healthy SE is generally considered to be 85% or higher."
