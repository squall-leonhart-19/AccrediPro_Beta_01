            "question": "Which strategy is most effective for shift workers to stabilize their circadian clock by maintaining a consistent 4-hour sleep block at the same time every day, regardless of their shift schedule?",
            "options": [
                "Split-shift napping",
                "Anchor sleep",
                "Circadian phase-shifting",
                "Photic entrainment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves identifying a 4-hour window where the worker can always be asleep, regardless of whether they are on a night shift or an off-day, which helps provide a 'time cue' for the circadian system."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the landmark study by Mah et al. (2011) on Stanford basketball players, what was the primary outcome of extending sleep to 10 hours per night for several weeks?",
            "options": [
                "A 5% reduction in cortisol levels",
                "A 9% increase in free-throw and three-point shooting accuracy",
                "A 15% increase in vertical jump height",
                "No significant change in performance but improved mood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that sleep extension significantly improved specific athletic performance metrics, including a 9% increase in shooting accuracy and faster sprint times."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When traveling across time zones, why is 'Eastward' travel generally considered more difficult for the body to adjust to (the 'East is Beast' phenomenon)?",
            "options": [
                "The body's natural circadian rhythm is slightly longer than 24 hours, making it easier to delay sleep than to advance it.",
                "Eastward travel involves more exposure to high-altitude radiation.",
                "The core body temperature drops faster when traveling toward the sunrise.",
                "Melatonin production is inhibited more aggressively by eastern light spectrums."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Because the human circadian period is typically ~24.2 hours, the body finds it easier to 'stay up later' (westward) than to 'go to sleep earlier' (eastward)."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Research on the Sleep-Leptin-Ghrelin link shows that restricting sleep to 4-5 hours per night typically results in what hormonal shift?",
            "options": [
                "15% increase in Leptin and 15% decrease in Ghrelin",
                "No change in Leptin but a 50% increase in Ghrelin",
                "Approx. 18% decrease in Leptin and 28% increase in Ghrelin",
                "30% increase in both Leptin and Ghrelin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation causes a 'double hit' to appetite regulation: Leptin (the satiety hormone) decreases, while Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) increases significantly."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "For high-stakes executives, staying awake for 17 to 19 consecutive hours has been shown to result in cognitive performance impairments equivalent to what Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that 17-19 hours of wakefulness produces performance levels equivalent to a 0.05% BAC, while 24 hours of wakefulness is equivalent to 0.10% BAC."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the context of mental health, sleep deprivation specifically impairs the functional connectivity between which two brain regions, leading to heightened emotional reactivity?",
            "options": [
                "The hippocampus and the cerebellum",
                "The amygdala and the prefrontal cortex",
                "The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland",
                "The basal ganglia and the thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep loss weakens the 'top-down' inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex over the amygdala, causing the amygdala to overreact to negative stimuli."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "According to longitudinal research on the 'Sleep-Pain Cycle,' which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the relationship between sleep and chronic pain?",
            "options": [
                "Pain levels are a much stronger predictor of that night's sleep quality than sleep is of pain.",
                "Sleep and pain have no statistical correlation when controlled for age.",
                "Poor sleep quality is a stronger and more reliable predictor of next-day pain sensitivity than pain is of sleep quality.",
                "Pain only affects REM sleep, while sleep quality only affects inflammatory markers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While bidirectional, the relationship is asymmetrical; sleep quality is a more potent predictor of next-day pain than vice-versa, suggesting sleep is a primary driver of pain modulation."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "For first responders and crisis workers, what is the 'First Responder Paradox' regarding sleep?",
            "options": [
                "They require less sleep than the general population due to high adrenaline.",
                "The high-stress nature of the job requires superior sleep for recovery, yet the job's demands make obtaining that sleep nearly impossible.",
                "They experience more REM sleep during daytime naps than nighttime sleep.",
                "Their circadian rhythms eventually disappear after 10 years of service."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The paradox describes the conflict between the physiological necessity for high-quality sleep to manage trauma and the operational barriers that prevent it."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the daily pulse of Growth Hormone (GH), essential for athletic muscle repair and bone growth, is secreted during the first cycle of Slow Wave Sleep (SWS)?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",
                "Up to 70%",
                "95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The majority of anabolic growth hormone release (up to 70%) occurs during the first deep sleep (SWS) cycle of the night, making early-night sleep critical for physical recovery."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A study by Nedeltcheva et al. (2010) found that when dieters restricted sleep to 5.5 hours (vs. 8.5 hours), the proportion of weight lost from fat dropped by what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "10%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that sleep-deprived individuals lost the same amount of total weight, but 55% less of that weight came from fat, with more coming from lean muscle mass."
