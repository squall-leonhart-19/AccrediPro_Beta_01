            "question": "During NREM Stage 2 (N2) sleep, which EEG phenomenon is primarily responsible for 'sensory gating,' protecting the brain from being awakened by external stimuli?",
            "options": [
                "Delta waves",
                "Sleep spindles",
                "Alpha rhythm",
                "Sawtooth waves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep spindles are bursts of brain activity (11-16 Hz) that occur during N2 sleep. They are critical for sensory gating, memory consolidation, and protecting the sleep state from environmental noise."

                "Exercise has no phase-shifting effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on non-photic zeitgebers demonstrate that exercise can shift the circadian rhythm by 60 to 90 minutes, making it a powerful tool for entrainment alongside light exposure."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When implementing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) as part of a coaching program, what is the generally accepted 'floor' or minimum time allowed for the Time in Bed (TIB) window to ensure safety?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In CBT-I and professional coaching protocols, the TIB window is rarely set below 5 hours to prevent excessive daytime sleepiness and ensure the safety of the client (e.g., during driving)."

            "id": "q12_5",

            "options": [
                "An abnormally high HRV following extreme overtraining where the heart rate does not respond to stress",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Parasympathetic saturation occurs when an athlete is severely overreached; the HRV appears high, but the heart rate remains low and non-responsive, which can be misidentified as 'good' recovery by novices."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never advise on the titration, replacement, or cessation of prescription medications. All medication-related queries must be referred to the prescribing physician."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep loss increases Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and decreases Leptin (the satiety hormone), typically resulting in an intake of roughly 300-400 extra calories the next day."

            "question": "A client's sleep diary indicates they spend 8 hours in bed (11 PM - 7 AM) but their wearable shows they only slept for 5.5 hours. What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE)?",

                "55%",
