            "question": "In the critical appraisal of sleep literature, which statistical metric is considered most indicative of the 'clinical significance' or magnitude of an intervention's impact, such as CBT-I?",
            "options": [
                "The p-value (p < 0.05)",
                "The Pearson correlation coefficient (r)",
                "Effect size (e.g., Cohen's d or Hedges' g)",
                "The confidence interval width"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While p-values indicate statistical significance, effect sizes (like Cohen's d) measure the magnitude of the treatment effect. In CBT-I research, effect sizes for sleep latency and WASO are often large (>0.8), indicating high clinical relevance."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) regulates the circadian clock primarily through the expression of 'clock genes.' Which specific protein complex forms the negative feedback loop by inhibiting its own transcription?",
            "options": [
                "CLOCK:BMAL1",
                "PER:CRY",
                "Melanopsin:PACAP",
                "GABA:Glutamate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The circadian molecular clock operates via a transcription-translation feedback loop where the PER (Period) and CRY (Cryptochrome) proteins dimerize and inhibit the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to the evidence-based review of CBT-I, 'Stimulus Control' therapy (Bootzin's technique) primarily targets which psychological mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "The homeostatic sleep drive (Process S)",
                "Conditioned arousal and the weakened association between the bed and sleep",
                "Cognitive distortions regarding the consequences of insomnia",
                "The suppression of the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control is designed to re-establish the bed as a cue for sleep rather than a cue for wakefulness or frustration, addressing the 'conditioned arousal' that characterizes chronic insomnia."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Research on the 'Sleep Sanctuary' indicates that peak sensitivity for melanopsin-containing ipRGCs occurs at which light wavelength?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 420 nm (Violet)",

                "Approximately 550 nm (Green)",
                "Approximately 630 nm (Red)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs) are most sensitive to short-wavelength blue light, specifically around 480 nm, which most effectively suppresses melatonin production."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 5 found that restricting sleep to 4 hours for just two nights resulted in which specific hormonal shift?",
            "options": [
                "15% increase in Leptin and 10% decrease in Ghrelin",
                "28% increase in insulin sensitivity",
                "18% decrease in Leptin and 28% increase in Ghrelin",
                "No significant change in metabolic hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation causes a 'metabolic double-whammy': a decrease in the satiety hormone leptin and an increase in the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin, often leading to a caloric surplus of ~300-500 kcal/day."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "The Glymphatic System, which clears neurotoxic waste like Beta-Amyloid, has been shown in rodent and human MRI studies to be most efficient during which state?",

                "Quiet wakefulness during meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glymphatic clearance is most active during Slow Wave Sleep (N3) when the interstitial space increases by 60%. Research also suggests the lateral position may facilitate better clearance compared to supine or prone positions."

                "Rapid induction of the Melatonin-1 (MT1) receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium acts as an NMDA antagonist and a GABA agonist, helping to reduce neural hyperexcitability and supporting the relaxation required for sleep onset."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Future Frontiers,' what is a known limitation of current consumer-grade wearables (using PPG technology) compared to Polysomnography (PSG)?",
            "options": [
                "They are unable to track heart rate variability (HRV)",
                "They tend to overestimate total sleep time and underestimate Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)",
                "They are more accurate than PSG for staging N3 sleep",
                "They cannot distinguish between wakefulness and light sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most consumer wearables use accelerometry and PPG; while they are improving, they generally lack the sensitivity of EEG and tend to be 'over-optimistic,' overestimating total sleep and undercounting brief awakenings."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 4 involved a client with 'social jetlag.' If their mid-sleep point on workdays is 2:00 AM and on weekends is 5:00 AM, what is their calculated social jetlag?",

                "7 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social jetlag is calculated as the difference between the mid-point of sleep on free days (5:00 AM) and workdays (2:00 AM), which in this case is 3 hours."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Forest Plot' in a meta-analysis of sleep interventions?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Forest Plot is the standard visual tool in meta-analyses to display the results of multiple studies, showing individual effect sizes and the 'diamond' representing the overall pooled effect."
