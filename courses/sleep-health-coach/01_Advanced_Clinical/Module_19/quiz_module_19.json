            "question": "When critically appraising sleep research, a Cohen's d effect size of 0.85 for a CBT-I intervention would be interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "A small effect with limited clinical relevance",
                "A medium effect comparable to placebo",
                "A large effect indicating significant clinical impact",
                "A negligible effect requiring a larger sample size"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In sleep science literature, a Cohen's d of 0.8 or higher is classified as a 'large' effect size, suggesting the intervention has a substantial impact on the population studied."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "The intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are most sensitive to which specific wavelength of light, triggering the suppression of melatonin via the SCN?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 480 nm (Blue light)",
                "Approximately 550 nm (Green light)",
                "Approximately 630 nm (Red light)",
                "Approximately 380 nm (Ultraviolet)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research into the neurobiology of the circadian clock identifies melanopsin-containing ipRGCs as being maximally sensitive to short-wavelength blue light around 480 nm."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A meta-analysis comparing CBT-I to sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines) for chronic insomnia found which of the following long-term outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Medications were more effective at the 12-month follow-up",
                "CBT-I showed sustained improvements, while medication benefits diminished after discontinuation",
                "Both interventions showed identical relapse rates after 6 months",
                "CBT-I was only effective when combined with low-dose Zolpidem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence consistently shows that while medications may work faster initially, CBT-I provides superior long-term outcomes and lower relapse rates once the intervention ends."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "According to the physics of the 'Sleep Sanctuary,' what is the physiological mechanism by which a room temperature of 18.3°C (65°F) facilitates sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "It increases core body temperature to stimulate metabolism",
                "It facilitates the necessary 1°C drop in core body temperature by aiding peripheral vasodilation",
                "It triggers the release of cortisol to regulate the wake cycle",
                "It prevents the glymphatic system from over-activating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A cooler environment supports the body's natural thermoregulatory requirement to drop core temperature by approximately 1°C (2-3°F) to initiate and maintain deep sleep."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Research on endocrinology and sleep restriction (e.g., 4 hours per night) has demonstrated a specific hormonal shift. Which of the following is correct?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin increases by 18% and Ghrelin decreases by 24%",
                "Both Leptin and Ghrelin decrease by 20%",
                "Leptin decreases by approximately 18% and Ghrelin increases by approximately 28%",
                "Insulin sensitivity increases to compensate for glucose spikes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation causes a 'double whammy' effect on appetite: Leptin (satiety hormone) drops and Ghrelin (hunger hormone) rises, significantly increasing caloric cravings."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "The glymphatic system's clearance of metabolic waste, such as beta-amyloid, is most efficient during which state, according to neuro-regenerative research?",
            "options": [
                "Active REM sleep",
                "Light N1 sleep",
                "Slow Wave Sleep (N3) when extracellular space increases by 60%",
                "During periods of intense cognitive 'flow' while awake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research by Nedergaard et al. demonstrated that during N3 sleep, the interstitial space in the brain increases by 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out neurotoxic waste."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "In an evidence-based review of phytotherapy, Valeriana officinalis (Valerian root) was found to differ from pharmacological sedatives in what way?",
            "options": [
                "It works instantly upon the first dose",
                "It typically requires 2-4 weeks of consistent use to produce significant improvements in sleep latency",
                "It carries a much higher risk of 'rebound insomnia' than benzodiazepines",
                "It acts as a direct melatonin receptor agonist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike pharmaceutical 'Z-drugs,' Valerian root often requires a cumulative loading period of several weeks before clinical efficacy is observed in trials."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the primary limitation of consumer-grade wearables that use Photoplethysmography (PPG) to track sleep stages?",
            "options": [
                "They cannot measure heart rate variability (HRV)",
                "They tend to overestimate total sleep time by misidentifying quiet wakefulness as sleep",
                "They are 100% accurate compared to Polysomnography (PSG)",
                "They can only track REM sleep, not NREM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While useful for trends, most wearables struggle to distinguish between 'motionless wakefulness' and actual sleep, leading to an overestimation of total sleep duration."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "During a Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) intervention, a client's 'Sleep Efficiency' (SE) is calculated. If the SE is above 90%, the practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Reduce the time in bed by 15 minutes",
                "Maintain the current schedule for another month",
                "Increase the time in bed by 15-20 minutes",
                "Discontinue the intervention immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In evidence-based SRT protocols, a Sleep Efficiency above 85-90% indicates that the sleep drive is strong enough to allow for a gradual increase in the sleep window."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "The 'First Night Effect' in sleep research refers to which phenomenon that practitioners must account for when reviewing data?",
            "options": [
                "The immediate cure of insomnia after one session of CBT-I",
                "The tendency for clients to sleep better in a lab than at home",
                "Altered sleep architecture due to a novel environment, necessitating an 'acclimation' period",
                "The surge of melatonin during the first hour of darkness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'First Night Effect' is a well-documented research phenomenon where the first night of data is often discarded because the participant's sleep is disrupted by the new environment and equipment."
