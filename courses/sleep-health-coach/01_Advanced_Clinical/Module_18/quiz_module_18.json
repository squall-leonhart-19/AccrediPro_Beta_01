            "question": "When synthesizing the D.R.E.A.M. pillars, which interaction describes the 'Metabolic-Circadian' loop discussed in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "The impact of blue light on cortisol levels regardless of food intake.",
                "How the timing of nutrient intake (Diet) influences the peripheral clocks in the liver and gut, independent of the SCN.",
                "The use of heavy weightlifting to induce immediate REM sleep transitions.",
                "The relationship between bedroom temperature and psychological resilience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 emphasizes that while the SCN is the master clock, peripheral clocks in the metabolic system are heavily influenced by the timing of food intake, creating a critical synthesis between Diet and Rest."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A client's wearable data shows a high Heart Rate Variability (HRV) but a consistently low 'Readiness' score due to elevated resting heart rate (RHR). According to Lesson 2, what is the most likely synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "The client is in a state of peak athletic performance.",
                "The client has achieved perfect circadian alignment.",
                "The client may be experiencing acute physiological stress or an impending immune response, requiring a shift from 'Activity' to 'Rest'.",
                "The wearable device is malfunctioning and should be discarded."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating biomarkers requires looking at the relationship between metrics; a high HRV with a rising RHR often indicates the body is struggling to maintain homeostasis against a stressor or illness."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "In the 'Psychophysiological Bridge' (Lesson 3), why is it recommended to combine Stimulus Control (CBT-I) with biological resets like morning light exposure?",
            "options": [
                "To confuse the brain into sleeping during the day.",
                "Because behavioral changes alone cannot override a severely delayed circadian phase (biological drive).",
                "To ensure the client spends as much money as possible on supplements.",
                "Because light exposure is the only way to treat insomnia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 explains that behavioral interventions (Mindset) work best when the underlying biological drive (Environment/Light) is synchronized, bridging the gap between psychology and biology."

        {
            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "According to the Environmental Neurobiology lesson, what is the 'Biological Threshold' of light intensity (lux) required at the eye level to significantly suppress melatonin production in most adults?",
            "options": [
                "5-10 lux",
                "Around 30-50 lux",

                "Over 2,000 lux"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research cited in Lesson 5 shows that even relatively dim indoor light (30-50 lux) can suppress melatonin by up to 50% in sensitive individuals, necessitating advanced environmental control."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "Using the D.R.E.A.M. Decision-Making Tree (Lesson 6), if a client presents with both 'Chronic Caffeine Overuse' and 'Poor Bedroom Blackout Curtains,' which is typically prioritized first?",
            "options": [
                "The curtains, because environmental fixes are 'low-hanging fruit' with immediate biological impact.",
                "Caffeine, because it is the most difficult to change.",
                "Neither; the coach should focus on exercise first.",
                "Both should be changed simultaneously on day one to maximize shock to the system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Strategic Prioritization model suggests addressing environmental 'friction' first as it requires less cognitive effort from the client than changing a chemical dependency, building early momentum."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 7 (Professional Synthesis), what is the ethical boundary regarding a client who shows a 'Mallampati Score' indicating a restricted airway and reports chronic snoring?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should prescribe a CPAP machine immediately.",
                "The coach should suggest throat exercises and continue with the D.R.E.A.M. protocol exclusively.",
                "The coach must refer the client to a sleep physician for a clinical sleep study (PSG) to rule out OSA.",
                "The coach should ignore the snoring as it is outside the D.R.E.A.M. pillars."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical synthesis requires recognizing clinical 'Red Flags.' Suspected Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is outside the scope of coaching and requires a medical referral."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Amino Acid Competition' for the blood-brain barrier. Which nutritional synthesis helps Tryptophan enter the brain to produce melatonin?",

                "Taking Tryptophan only on an empty stomach with black coffee."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The insulin spike from carbohydrates reduces the levels of competing amino acids in the blood, allowing Tryptophan to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "A client has a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) based on lab biomarkers. According to Lesson 2, which D.R.E.A.M. intervention is most indicated?",

                "A 24-hour fast to reset the metabolic clock."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat CAR indicates a blunted stress response/circadian start; integrating Environment (Light) and Activity (Movement) early in the morning helps 're-anchor' the cortisol curve."

            "id": "q18_9",

                "Only using one of the five pillars to simplify the process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves the sophisticated application of the framework to unique populations, synthesizing various data points into a cohesive, personalized strategy."

                "Caffeine has a half-life of 5-6 hours in the average adult."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The thermoregulatory requirement (1-2 degree drop) is a core physiological fact used to justify environmental interventions like room cooling and warm baths."
