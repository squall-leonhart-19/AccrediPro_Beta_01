            "question": "A client completes the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and receives a global score of 8. How should a Sleep Health Coach interpret this result based on clinical validation?",
            "options": [
                "The client is a 'good sleeper' as the score is below the threshold of 10.",
                "The client is a 'poor sleeper' as any score above 5 indicates significant sleep disturbance.",
                "The score is inconclusive and requires a 2-week sleep diary to determine clinical significance.",
                "The score indicates a high probability of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PSQI uses a global score of >5 to distinguish 'poor' sleepers from 'good' sleepers with a sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5%."

            "question": "When analyzing a sleep diary, a client reports spending 9 hours in bed (TIB) but only sleeping for 6.5 hours (TST). What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE) and what does it suggest?",
            "options": [
                "SE is 82%; this is within the normal range for healthy adults.",
                "SE is 72%; this suggests significant sleep fragmentation or insomnia-related wakefulness.",
                "SE is 90%; the client is likely overestimating their wake time.",
                "SE is 65%; the client should immediately be referred for a polysomnography."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated as (TST / TIB) * 100. (6.5 / 9) * 100 = 72.2%. A healthy SE is generally considered >85%."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Most wearables are highly sensitive (good at detecting sleep) but have low specificity (struggle to distinguish quiet wakefulness from sleep), often leading to an overestimation of total sleep time."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
