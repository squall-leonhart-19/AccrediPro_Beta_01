            "question": "A client completes the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and receives a total score of 19. According to clinical validation standards, how should this score be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "No clinically significant insomnia",
                "Subthreshold insomnia",

            "question": "During a 14-day Sleep Diary analysis, a client reports an average Time in Bed (TIB) of 9 hours and a Total Sleep Time (TST) of 6.75 hours. What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE) and is it within the healthy target range?",
            "options": [
                "75%; No, the target is >85%",
                "80%; Yes, the target is >80%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is (TST/TIB) x 100. (6.75 / 9) = 0.75 or 75%. For most adults, an SE above 85% is considered the clinical benchmark for healthy sleep consolidation."

            "question": "A 2020 meta-analysis of consumer-grade wearables (e.g., Oura, Fitbit) found that while they show high 'sensitivity' (detecting sleep), they often show low 'specificity.' What does this mean for data interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "They often fail to detect when a person is actually asleep.",
                "They frequently misclassify quiet wakefulness as sleep, underestimating WASO.",
                "They are unable to distinguish between REM and Light sleep.",
                "They overestimate the amount of deep sleep by 40% on average."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low specificity in sleep technology refers to the inability to accurately detect wakefulness (WASO). Wearables often count lying still in bed as sleep, leading to an overestimation of sleep duration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Jetlag is the absolute difference between the midpoint of sleep on work days (MSW) and the midpoint of sleep on free days (MSF). A difference of >1 hour is associated with metabolic and mood disruptions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A STOP-BANG score of 5-8 indicates a high risk for Moderate to Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Coaches must refer clients with high-risk screening scores to medical professionals for diagnosis before proceeding with behavioral coaching."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DBAS-16 measures the 'Cognitive' component, specifically focusing on unrealistic expectations, misconceptions about the causes of insomnia, and anxiety regarding the consequences of poor sleep."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' clinical ranges for ferritin can be as low as 15-30 ng/mL, sleep medicine guidelines (IRLSSG) suggest that ferritin should be >75 ng/mL to minimize RLS and Periodic Limb Movement symptoms."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the D.R.E.A.M. framework (Data, Rhythms, Environment, Anxiety, Metabolism), 'R' stands for Rhythms, which focuses on the client's internal clock, chronotype, and social jetlag."

            "question": "A client has an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 16, but their wearable data shows a consistent 8 hours of sleep per night. What does this discrepancy most likely suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client is 'faking' their sleepiness.",
                "The sleep quality is poor (e.g., due to fragmentation or SDB) despite adequate duration.",

                "The wearable is malfunctioning and should be replaced."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An ESS score >10 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness. If duration is adequate (8 hours), the coach must investigate sleep 'quality' and potential underlying disorders like Sleep-Disordered Breathing or Narcolepsy."
