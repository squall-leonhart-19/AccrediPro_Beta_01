            "question": "When utilizing light therapy to treat Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD), at what point relative to the core body temperature minimum (Tmin) should bright light exposure occur to induce a phase advance?",
            "options": [
                "2 hours before Tmin",
                "Exactly at the moment of Tmin",
                "1-3 hours after Tmin",
                "6 hours after Tmin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the Phase Response Curve (PRC), light exposure shortly after the core body temperature minimum (usually 2-3 hours before natural wake time) results in a phase advance, shifting the sleep-wake cycle earlier."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In neurofeedback training for chronic insomnia, which frequency band is typically targeted for enhancement to improve sleep spindle density and reduce sleep onset latency?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha (8-12 Hz)",
                "Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR, 12-15 Hz)",
                "Theta (4-7 Hz)",
                "High Beta (20-30 Hz)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SMR neurofeedback training (12-15 Hz) has been shown in clinical trials to increase sleep spindle activity and improve sleep quality by reducing the hyperarousal associated with insomnia."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client with psychophysiological insomnia is instructed to 'try to stay awake as long as possible' while lying in bed. This CBT-I enhancement technique is known as:",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Defusion",
                "Paradoxical Intention",
                "Sleep Compression",
                "Stimulus Control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical Intention involves asking the client to engage in the behavior they fear (staying awake), which reduces the performance anxiety and autonomic arousal that typically prevents sleep onset."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Which amino acid serves as the direct precursor to serotonin and melatonin, and has been shown to improve sleep efficiency in doses of 1-5g?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tyrosine",
                "L-Theanine",
                "L-Tryptophan",
                "Glycine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-Tryptophan is the essential amino acid precursor for serotonin and melatonin synthesis. Research indicates it can reduce sleep latency and improve sleep efficiency, particularly in those with mild insomnia."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "To facilitate sleep onset via thermoregulation, the 'distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient' (DPG) should be:",
            "options": [
                "Minimized (cold hands and feet)",
                "Increased (warm hands and feet relative to the core)",
                "Equalized with core temperature",
                "Reversed (hot core, cold extremities)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vasodilation in the hands and feet (distal regions) allows for the dissipation of core heat. An increased DPG is one of the strongest physiological predictors of rapid sleep onset."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "A 'blunted' or flat Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), where cortisol fails to rise significantly 30-45 minutes after waking, is a clinical marker often associated with:",
            "options": [
                "Acute performance anxiety",
                "Chronic exhaustion, burnout, or PTSD",
                "High metabolic flexibility",
                "Optimal HPA axis function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a high CAR is linked to anticipatory stress, a blunted or flat CAR is frequently observed in individuals suffering from chronic fatigue, burnout, or long-term HPA axis dysregulation."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In the context of respiratory modulation, what is a primary physiological benefit of nasal breathing over mouth breathing during sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Increased oxygen saturation (SpO2) to 100%",
                "Increased Nitric Oxide (NO) production and improved CO2 tolerance",

                "Elimination of the need for REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nasal breathing facilitates the production of Nitric Oxide in the paranasal sinuses, which acts as a vasodilator and bronchodilator, while also helping to maintain optimal CO2 levels for the Bohr effect."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "The 'Everyman' polyphasic sleep structure is characterized by which of the following configurations?",
            "options": [
                "Six 20-minute naps spaced equally (2 hours total)",
                "One core sleep block (approx. 3 hours) and three 20-minute naps",
                "Two 4-hour sleep blocks with a 2-hour wake period between",
                "Four 30-minute naps and no core sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Everyman schedule is a popular polyphasic variant that uses a core sleep block (usually 3-3.5 hours) supplemented by three 20-minute naps to maintain alertness with reduced total sleep time."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "The 'Nap Latte' or caffeine nap protocol involves consuming caffeine immediately before a 20-minute nap. Why is this timing effective?",
            "options": [
                "Caffeine increases GABA production during Stage 2 sleep",
                "Caffeine takes approximately 20-30 minutes to reach peak plasma levels and clear adenosine receptors",
                "Caffeine prevents the sleeper from entering Stage 1 sleep",
                "Caffeine lowers the core body temperature to induce deeper sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because caffeine takes about 20-30 minutes to metabolize and compete for adenosine receptors, the sleeper benefits from the nap's adenosine clearance just as the caffeine begins to take effect."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "In Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for insomnia, the process of observing thoughts like 'I will be a wreck tomorrow' as mere language rather than absolute truth is called:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion is an ACT technique that helps clients create distance from distressing thoughts, reducing their emotional impact and the subsequent arousal that interferes with sleep."
