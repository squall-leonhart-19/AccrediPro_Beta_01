            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "According to the Phase Response Curve (PRC), to achieve a 'phase advance' (shifting the sleep-wake cycle earlier), when should a client be exposed to high-intensity blue-enriched light?",
            "options": [
                "2 hours before their habitual bedtime",
                "Immediately upon waking, after the core body temperature minimum (Tmin)",
                "During the mid-afternoon 'post-prandial dip'",
                "3 hours before the core body temperature minimum (Tmin)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light exposure after the core body temperature minimum (Tmin)—which typically occurs 2-3 hours before natural waking—triggers a phase advance, shifting the circadian clock earlier."

        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback, which metric is the most reliable indicator of parasympathetic activation and 'sleep readiness' during a pre-sleep protocol?",
            "options": [
                "LF/HF Ratio",
                "Mean Heart Rate",
                "RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences)",
                "SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the primary time-domain metric used to assess vagally-mediated changes in HRV, reflecting the body's ability to transition into a parasympathetic state necessary for sleep onset."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'sleep effort'—the psychological phenomenon of trying too hard to fall asleep. Which CBT-I enhancement involves the client staying awake as long as possible to reduce performance anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT)",
                "Stimulus Control",
                "Cognitive Restructuring",
                "Paradoxical Intention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical Intention (PI) requires the client to engage in the behavior they fear (staying awake), which eliminates the performance anxiety associated with trying to force sleep, often leading to faster sleep onset."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A 2019 study (Kim et al.) demonstrated that the combination of GABA and L-Theanine had a synergistic effect on sleep compared to either alone. What was the specific primary outcome of this combination?",
            "options": [
                "A 20% increase in REM sleep duration",
                "Decreased sleep latency and increased NREM sleep duration",
                "Complete elimination of night awakenings",
                "Increased morning cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The GABA/Theanine mixture has been shown to decrease sleep latency and significantly increase NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep duration compared to monotherapy or control groups."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "The 'Distal-to-Proximal Gradient' (DPG) is a critical concept in thermoregulation. How does a warm bath 90 minutes before bed facilitate sleep onset?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the core body temperature and keeping it elevated throughout the night",
                "By inducing peripheral vasodilation (warming hands and feet), which allows core heat to dissipate",
                "By stimulating the sympathetic nervous system to increase metabolic rate",
                "By preventing the release of melatonin through skin warming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Warming the skin (distal areas) causes vasodilation, which facilitates the transfer of heat from the body's core to the surface, resulting in the rapid drop in core body temperature required for sleep."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is characterized by a specific rise in cortisol levels. What is the clinical benchmark for a normal CAR within the first 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "A 10-20% increase from waking levels",
                "A 50-75% increase from waking levels",
                "A 100% decrease from waking levels",
                "No change; cortisol should remain stable until noon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A robust CAR typically involves a 50-75% increase in cortisol levels within 30-45 minutes of waking, indicating a healthy HPA axis and preparing the body for the day's demands."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In respiratory modulation, why is nasal breathing preferred over mouth breathing for optimizing sleep quality and reducing the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI)?",
            "options": [
                "It increases CO2 expulsion, leading to respiratory alkalosis",
                "It bypasses the production of Nitric Oxide",
                "It increases airway resistance slightly to strengthen the diaphragm",
                "It facilitates Nitric Oxide production and maintains optimal airway patency through humidity and pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Nasal breathing filters, warms, and humidifies air while stimulating the production of Nitric Oxide, a vasodilator that improves oxygen uptake and helps maintain upper airway stability."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "When implementing a 'High-Performance Napping' protocol for a client with a 2:00 PM energy slump, what is the recommended duration to avoid 'Sleep Inertia'?",
            "options": [
                "10-20 minutes (Power Nap)",
                "45-50 minutes",
                "75 minutes",
                "120 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A 10-20 minute power nap stays within the lighter stages of NREM sleep (N1 and N2), allowing the client to wake up feeling refreshed without the grogginess (sleep inertia) associated with waking from Stage N3 (Deep Sleep)."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for insomnia differs from traditional CBT-I by focusing on which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Rigid adherence to an 8-hour sleep window",
                "Using sedative-hypnotics to ensure sleep occurs",
                "Developing 'psychological flexibility' and accepting the presence of wakefulness without struggle",
                "Eliminating all thoughts related to sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ACT focuses on psychological flexibility and 'defusion' from distressing thoughts, encouraging clients to accept wakefulness rather than struggling against it, which indirectly reduces the arousal that prevents sleep."

        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "Metabolic cooling protocols suggest that the optimal ambient room temperature for adult sleep, when using standard bedding and light sleepwear, is approximately:",
            "options": [
                "24.5°C (76°F)",
                "21.1°C (70°F)",
                "18.3°C (65°F)",
                "12.8°C (55°F)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research and clinical guidelines generally suggest that 18.3°C (65°F) is the optimal temperature for most adults to facilitate the necessary drop in core body temperature for deep, restorative sleep."
