            "question": "A client presents with Psychophysiological Insomnia (PPI). They report feeling exhausted all day but becoming 'wide awake' the moment their head hits the pillow. This phenomenon is scientifically defined as:",
            "options": [
                "Circadian Misalignment",
                "Conditioned Hyperarousal",
                "Sleep State Misperception",
                "Homeostatic Sleep Pressure Deficit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conditioned hyperarousal occurs when the sleep environment (the bed/bedroom) becomes a learned trigger for wakefulness and anxiety rather than relaxation, a hallmark of Psychophysiological Insomnia."

            "question": "When managing Shift Work Disorder, 'Anchor Sleep' is a strategy designed to stabilize the circadian rhythm by:",
            "options": [
                "Sleeping for 12 hours straight on transition days",
                "Taking a 90-minute nap exactly 4 hours before a night shift",
                "Maintaining a consistent 4-hour sleep block at the same time every day, regardless of shift",
                "Using high-dose caffeine during the 'Circadian Dead Zone' (3:00 AM - 5:00 AM)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves keeping a specific 4-hour block of sleep constant (e.g., 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM) every day to provide the master clock with a consistent temporal cue."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "During the menopausal transition, the decline in Progesterone is particularly disruptive to sleep because Progesterone metabolizes into Allopregnanolone, which acts as a potent agonist for:",

                "GABA-A receptors",
                "Adenosine A1 receptors",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Progesterone's metabolite, allopregnanolone, has a sedative effect by modulating GABA-A receptors. Its decline reduces the threshold for arousal and increases anxiety."

                "Athletes sleeping <8 hours are 1.7 times more likely to get injured than those sleeping >8 hours",
                "Sleep duration has no statistically significant impact on acute musculoskeletal injuries",
                "Oversleeping (>10 hours) is the primary driver of ligament laxity and injury",
                "Injury risk is only correlated with REM sleep deprivation, not total sleep time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A study of adolescent athletes found that sleeping less than 8 hours per night was the strongest predictor of injury, with a 1.7x increased risk compared to those getting adequate rest."

                "Increasing the child's sugar intake in the afternoon to induce a 'crash'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Limit-setting BIC is characterized by the child stalling or refusing bedtime. The intervention focuses on firm boundaries and positive reinforcement tools like the 'Bedtime Pass' to reduce curtain-calling."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Post-Viral Fatigue Syndrome (PVFS) often involves 'Alpha-Delta Sleep.' This is characterized by:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha-delta sleep is a pattern where wake-like alpha waves intrude upon deep N3 delta sleep, leading to non-restorative sleep and chronic fatigue, common in post-viral and fibromyalgia cases."

                "A total loss of the homeostatic sleep drive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Age-related changes in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) often cause the circadian rhythm to shift earlier, resulting in an advanced sleep phase (early to bed, early to rise)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Constructive Worry involves writing down concerns and solutions hours before bed, which reduces cognitive load and pre-sleep rumination, preventing the 3:00 AM 'popcorn' effect."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In the 'Immune-Sleep Axis' lesson, which cytokine is identified as being both a sleep-promoter and a mediator of the 'sickness response' during infection?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interleukin-1 (and TNF-alpha) are pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase the intensity and duration of Non-REM sleep as part of the body's immune defense mechanism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sundowning (nocturnal confusion/agitation) can indicate underlying neurological issues, dementia, or medication toxicity and requires medical evaluation beyond the scope of sleep coaching."
