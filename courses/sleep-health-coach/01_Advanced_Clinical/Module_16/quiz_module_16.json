            "question": "A client with psychophysiological insomnia reports feeling exhausted all day but becoming 'wide awake' the moment they begin their bedtime routine. This phenomenon is scientifically categorized as:",
            "options": [
                "Homeostatic Sleep Pressure failure",
                "Conditioned Arousal (Stimulus Control failure)",
                "Idiopathic hypersomnia",
                "Circadian Misalignment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conditioned arousal occurs when the bed and bedtime environment become associated with wakefulness, frustration, and anxiety rather than sleep, a hallmark of psychophysiological insomnia."

            "question": "When managing a shift worker on a permanent night rotation (23:00–07:00), which intervention most effectively facilitates 'Circadian Entrainment' to their work schedule?",
            "options": [
                "Using blue-light emitting glasses during the drive home at 07:00",
                "Taking 10mg of Melatonin at 22:00 before starting the shift",

                "Consuming high-carbohydrate meals at 03:00 to boost energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bright light exposure during the first half of a night shift helps suppress melatonin and shift the circadian phase later, assisting in adaptation to night work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In menopause, the 'thermoneutral zone' narrows; even small changes in temperature trigger a sympathetic 'fight or flight' response (hot flash) to dissipate heat, causing arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep banking (extending sleep prior to a period of deprivation) has been shown to improve physical performance and cognitive function during subsequent sleep-restricted periods."

                "The child falls asleep immediately but wakes every 90 minutes screaming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Limit-setting BIC is characterized by the child's refusal to go to bed or stay in bed, often using stalling tactics (curtain calls) due to a lack of firm parental boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-1 are sleep-regulatory substances; however, chronic elevation in post-viral states can lead to fragmented sleep and non-restorative rest."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Cognitive Shuffle disrupts analytical/linear thinking by forcing the brain to visualize unrelated, non-threatening images, which mimics the pre-sleep 'hypnagogic' state."
