            "question": "When constructing a professional sleep plan as outlined in 'The Architecture of a Professional Sleep Plan,' what is the primary objective of the 'Stabilization Phase'?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize REM sleep through immediate supplementation",
                "To reduce sleep variability by establishing a consistent wake time and sleep window",
                "To eliminate all caffeine intake within the first 24 hours",
                "To perform high-intensity interval training to increase sleep pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization Phase focuses on anchoring the circadian rhythm and reducing homeostatic 'noise' by standardizing wake times and sleep windows before layering in more complex interventions."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In 'Diagnostic Synthesis,' if a client's actigraphy data shows 7.5 hours of sleep but their subjective sleep diary reports only 4 hours, this discrepancy is clinically termed:",
            "options": [
                "Paradoxical Insomnia (Sleep State Misperception)",
                "Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD)",

                "Hyperarousal Maladaptation Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical Insomnia occurs when there is a significant discrepancy between objective measures (actigraphy/PSG) and subjective reports, often requiring specific cognitive restructuring."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the Circadian Reset Protocols, bright light exposure administered 2 hours BEFORE the core body temperature minimum (Tmin) will result in which effect?",
            "options": [
                "A Phase Advance (shifting the clock earlier)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on the Phase Response Curve (PRC), light exposure in the late evening/early night (before Tmin) causes a phase delay, pushing the sleep-wake cycle later."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In 'Environmental Engineering,' what is the recommended maximum lux level for the 2-hour 'Biological Darkness' wind-down period to prevent melatonin suppression?",

                "Exactly 100 lux"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines suggest maintaining light levels below 50 lux (dim indoor lighting) during the wind-down period to allow for the natural rise of endogenous melatonin."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Regarding 'Root Cause Resolution,' which cortisol pattern is most frequently associated with 'maintenance insomnia' (waking up at 3:00 AM and unable to return to sleep)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nocturnal cortisol spikes, often triggered by blood sugar dysregulation or HPA-axis hyperreactivity, are a primary driver of middle-of-the-night awakenings."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "When implementing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT), what is the standard clinical 'floor' (minimum time in bed) used to ensure safety and prevent extreme sleep deprivation?",
            "options": [
                "4 hours",
                "4.5 hours",

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In 'Intervention Sequencing,' why is Stimulus Control often prioritized over SRT for clients with high levels of sleep-related anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "SRT can acutely increase cortisol and sympathetic arousal, potentially worsening anxiety",
                "Stimulus Control is more effective for increasing total sleep time",
                "SRT requires expensive tracking equipment that Stimulus Control does not",
                "Stimulus Control is only used for sleep onset issues, not maintenance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Because SRT involves significant sleep deprivation, it can spike cortisol and anxiety; therefore, Stimulus Control is often used first to break the bed-anxiety association."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course (n=8,234) found that 'Environmental Engineering' interventions (temperature and sound) improved Sleep Efficiency (SE) by an average of:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The data shows that optimizing the 'Sleep Sanctuary' typically results in an 8-12% improvement in Sleep Efficiency, making it a powerful secondary intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Three' prevents over-reactivity to transient poor sleep, advising clients to wait for three consecutive nights of disruption before modifying their plan."

            "question": "Case Study: Client 'Mark' has a Sleep Efficiency of 62% and spends 9 hours in bed but only sleeps 5.5 hours. He uses his bed for laptop work and watching TV. What is the most critical first-line behavioral intervention?",

                "Melatonin (3mg) 30 minutes before bed",
                "Bright Light Therapy at 10:00 AM",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mark demonstrates a clear 'conditioned arousal' and lack of stimulus control. Removing non-sleep activities is essential to re-associating the bed with sleep."
