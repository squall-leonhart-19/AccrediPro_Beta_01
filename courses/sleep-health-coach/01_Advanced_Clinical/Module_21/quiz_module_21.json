            "question": "In the 'Architecture of a Professional Sleep Plan,' why is the 'Stabilization Phase' prioritized before implementing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the client's sleep debt to ensure SRT works faster",
                "To reduce autonomic arousal and normalize the circadian signal, ensuring the client is physiologically prepared for restriction",
                "To allow the client to catch up on 'sleep debt' before the rigorous behavioral phase begins",
                "To test if environmental changes alone can solve the insomnia without behavioral intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization focuses on lowering HPA-axis activation and anchoring the circadian rhythm. Implementing SRT during a state of high autonomic arousal often leads to poor compliance and increased anxiety."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A Diagnostic Synthesis reveals a significant discrepancy: the client's sleep diary reports 4.5 hours of sleep, but actigraphy data shows 7.2 hours with a 91% Sleep Efficiency. This clinical profile is most indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "Objective Short Sleep Duration Insomnia",
                "Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with high fragmentation",

                "Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder (Delayed Phase)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical Insomnia occurs when the client's subjective perception of sleep significantly underestimates the objective sleep measured by actigraphy or PSG."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the Circadian Reset Protocols, if a client needs to 'Phase Advance' their sleep (shift it earlier), when is the most effective time to prescribe 10,000 lux light exposure?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately upon waking, near the core body temperature minimum (Tmin)",
                "During the mid-afternoon 'post-prandial dip'",
                "Two hours before the desired bedtime",
                "Exactly 12 hours after the Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Light exposure shortly after the core body temperature minimum (which usually occurs 1-2 hours before natural wake time) triggers a phase advance according to the Phase Response Curve (PRC)."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In the 'Clinical Sleep Sanctuary' protocol, what specific environmental threshold is recommended to prevent the suppression of melatonin during the 2-hour pre-sleep window?",
            "options": [
                "Light levels should be maintained below 200 lux",
                "Light levels should be maintained below 50 lux",
                "Light levels should be maintained below 500 lux",
                "Only 'blue light' matters; brightness (lux) is irrelevant to melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that room light levels above 50 lux can significantly suppress melatonin production and delay the onset of sleep."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'flat' Diurnal Cortisol Slope and high evening cortisol. Which 'Root Cause Resolution' strategy is most appropriate for balancing the HPA-Axis?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 8:00 PM",
                "Caffeine consumption limited to the afternoon only",

                "Increasing total caloric intake by 25% during the dinner meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phosphatidylserine has been shown in clinical studies to blunt the ACTH and cortisol response to physical and mental stress, making it useful for high-evening-cortisol presentations."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "When implementing Advanced Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT), what is the clinical 'Floor'—the minimum Time in Bed (TIB) that should never be crossed to ensure safety?",
            "options": [
                "4.0 hours",
                "4.5 hours",

                "6.5 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To prevent excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairment, and potential 'microsleeps' while driving, a minimum TIB floor of 5.5 hours is standard clinical practice."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In the Intervention Sequencing strategy, why is 'Stimulus Control' often introduced simultaneously with SRT?",
            "options": [
                "Because they address the same physiological mechanism of homeostatic pressure",
                "Because SRT creates the sleep pressure necessary for Stimulus Control to effectively re-associate the bed with sleep",
                "To make the protocol more difficult so only motivated clients continue",
                "To reduce the total number of weeks required for the treatment plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SRT builds the 'Sleep Drive' (homeostatic pressure), which makes the 'Stimulus Control' process (leaving the bed when awake) more effective by ensuring the client actually falls asleep quickly when they return to bed."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Case Study: A client has successfully increased their Sleep Efficiency (SE) from 65% to 90% over 3 weeks. What is the standard titration protocol for increasing their Time in Bed (TIB)?",
            "options": [
                "Increase TIB by 60 minutes immediately",
                "Keep TIB the same for another month to 'lock in' the results",
                "Increase TIB by 15-20 minutes and monitor SE for another week",
                "Allow the client to sleep as long as they want on weekends only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration should be gradual. If SE is >85-90%, the standard protocol is to increase TIB by 15-20 minutes and re-evaluate the SE after 7 days."

            "question": "Regarding Relapse Prevention, what does the 'Rule of Three' suggest as a trigger for a client to return to their 'Rescue Protocol'?",
            "options": [
                "3 hours of wakefulness in a single night",
                "3 consecutive nights of poor sleep, or 3 nights per week for 3 consecutive weeks",
                "3 nights of using a pharmacological sleep aid",
                "3 days of feeling tired in the afternoon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of Three' (3 nights/week for 3 weeks) is a common clinical marker used to distinguish a temporary 'bad patch' from a potential relapse into chronic insomnia."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module (n=8,234) found that the integration of multi-modal data (objective and subjective) improved treatment outcomes by what percentage compared to subjective logs alone?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "24%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that integrating actigraphy with diaries (multi-modal) leads to a 37% improvement in long-term outcomes by allowing for more precise titration and identifying misperception."
