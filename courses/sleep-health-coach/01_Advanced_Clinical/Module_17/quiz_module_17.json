            "question": "When managing a client with Shift Work Disorder, which strategy is most effective for maintaining a level of circadian stability during a block of night shifts?",
            "options": [
                "Utilizing 'Anchor Sleep' by maintaining a consistent 4-hour sleep block across all days",
                "Consuming 400mg of caffeine exactly two hours before the shift ends",
                "Exposing the client to bright blue light (10,000 lux) immediately before daytime sleep",
                "Taking a 3-hour nap immediately after the shift ends without using blackout curtains"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves keeping a specific 4-hour window of sleep consistent every day (e.g., 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM), which helps tether the circadian rhythm and reduces the severity of misalignment."

            "question": "Research cited in the module indicates that what percentage of adults with ADHD also meet the clinical criteria for Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder (DSPD)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "50-55%",
                "73-78%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies show a significant overlap between ADHD and circadian disruptions, with approximately 73-78% of adults with ADHD experiencing a delayed sleep phase."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In the context of Chronic Pain and sleep architecture, which biological mechanism explains why poor sleep often precedes an increase in pain sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines during N3 sleep",
                "Central Sensitization and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6",
                "The complete suppression of the sympathetic nervous system during sleep fragmentation",
                "A decrease in the density of REM sleep which processes physical trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation triggers central sensitization and increases pro-inflammatory markers like IL-6 and TNF-alpha, which lower the pain threshold the following day."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "During perimenopause and menopause, the decline in which hormone is primarily responsible for the reduction in GABAergic signaling, leading to increased sleep maintenance insomnia?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Progesterone",
                "Melatonin",
                "Luteinizing Hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone has a metabolite called allopregnanolone which acts as a potent GABA-A receptor agonist, providing sedative effects. Its decline leads to increased wakefulness and anxiety."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "An 82-year-old client reports waking up at 3:30 AM every morning and being unable to fall back asleep, despite feeling tired by 7:00 PM. This is a classic presentation of:",

                "REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ASPD is common in older adults due to the age-related shortening of the circadian period, leading to early sleep onset and early morning awakening."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "For elite athletes, what is the primary difference between 'Jet Lag' and 'Travel Fatigue'?",
            "options": [
                "Jet lag is purely psychological, while travel fatigue is physiological",
                "Jet lag requires crossing time zones; travel fatigue results from the stress and confinement of travel regardless of direction",
                "Travel fatigue only occurs on flights longer than 12 hours",
                "Jet lag improves with caffeine, while travel fatigue only improves with protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Travel fatigue is the cumulative weariness from the logistics and environment of travel, whereas jet lag specifically refers to the desynchrony between the internal clock and the destination time zone."

                "A total absence of Stage N1 sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Depression is often characterized by a 'pressure' for REM sleep, resulting in entering the first REM cycle much sooner than the average 90 minutes and having more frequent eye movements during REM."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "When working with a client with Long COVID or ME/CFS, why must a coach be cautious with standard 'Sleep Hygiene' recommendations like increasing daytime activity?",
            "options": [
                "It may cause excessive weight loss",
                "It can trigger Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), significantly worsening their baseline symptoms",
                "Exercise prevents the absorption of Vitamin D",
                "Physical activity has been proven to have no effect on sleep in viral recovery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In post-viral syndromes, the core symptom is PEM, where physical or cognitive exertion leads to a 'crash.' Standard advice to 'stay active to build sleep drive' can be dangerous for these clients."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (52) is experiencing hot flashes that wake her 4 times per night. She is also taking multiple medications for blood pressure and anxiety. What is the first priority for the Sleep Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend she stop all medications immediately",
                "Conduct a polypharmacy review with her physician to check for drug-induced insomnia or night sweats",
                "Suggest a high-protein diet at 10:00 PM",
                "Prescribe 10mg of melatonin to override the hot flashes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In aging and menopausal populations, polypharmacy is a major contributor to sleep issues. A coach must facilitate a medical review to ensure medications aren't exacerbating the insomnia."

            "question": "Case Study: Liam (8, ASD) has severe sensory processing issues and cannot tolerate the feel of standard pajamas or sheets, leading to 2-hour sleep onset delays. Which intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Bright light therapy at 9:00 PM",
                "Sensory-friendly bedding (seamless, compression) and a low-arousal 'sensory diet' before bed",
                "Removing all items from the room so it is a 'white box'",
                "Using high-frequency 'brown noise' at 90 decibels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For ASD/Sensory Processing issues, addressing the tactile environment is crucial. Compression sheets or seamless clothing can reduce the 'threat' signal the brain receives from sensory input."
