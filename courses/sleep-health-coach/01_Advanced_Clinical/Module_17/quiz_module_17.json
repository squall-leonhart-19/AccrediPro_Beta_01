            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A shift worker finishing a night shift at 07:00 needs to drive home. To prevent further suppression of melatonin and facilitate sleep upon arrival, what is the most effective evidence-based recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Consume 200mg of caffeine immediately before the drive",
                "Wear high-quality blue-blocking glasses (orange/amber tint) during the commute",
                "Expose themselves to 10,000 lux of bright light during the drive to stay alert",
                "Perform a high-intensity workout immediately upon returning home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To facilitate sleep after a night shift, the worker must avoid morning sunlight which triggers the 'stop' signal for melatonin. Blue-blocking glasses help preserve the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) process initiated during the shift."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that individuals with ADHD often experience a delay in Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO). On average, how much later is this onset compared to neurotypical controls?",
            "options": [
                "15 to 30 minutes",
                "30 to 45 minutes",
                "45 to 60 minutes",
                "90 to 120 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Bijlenga et al., 2013) show that adults with ADHD frequently experience a circadian phase delay of approximately 1.5 to 2 hours (90-120 minutes), contributing to chronic sleep-onset insomnia."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In the context of Chronic Pain (L3), what is the primary mechanism by which poor sleep exacerbates pain sensitivity the following day?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines",
                "Central Sensitization and impaired descending inhibitory pathways",
                "Excessive accumulation of Adenosine in the joints",
                "Deactivation of the amygdala's threat response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation impairs the brain's ability to 'gate' or inhibit pain signals (descending inhibition) and increases central sensitization, making the individual more reactive to painful stimuli."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "During Perimenopause and Menopause, the decline of which hormone is most directly linked to a reduction in GABAergic signaling, leading to increased sleep-maintenance insomnia?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Progesterone",
                "Luteinizing Hormone",
                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone has sedative effects via its metabolite, allopregnanolone, which acts on GABA-A receptors. Its decline during menopause is a major driver of fragmented sleep."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "The 'Aging Brain' (L5) often experiences an 'Advanced Sleep Phase.' What does this typically manifest as in a client's behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Difficulty falling asleep before midnight and waking up at noon",
                "Feeling very sleepy in the early evening (e.g., 7 PM) and waking up very early (e.g., 3 AM or 4 AM)",
                "Sleeping for 10+ hours but still feeling unrefreshed",
                "Total inability to enter Stage 3 Slow Wave Sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder (ASPD) is common in older adults, where the circadian clock shifts earlier, leading to early evening sleepiness and early morning spontaneous awakening."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In the landmark Stanford Basketball study (Cheri Mah et al.), what was the primary intervention that led to a 9% increase in free-throw and 3-point accuracy?",
            "options": [
                "Total caffeine prohibition",
                "Sleep extension to a minimum of 10 hours in bed per night",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 5 AM",
                "Cold water immersion therapy before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that 'sleep extension' (aiming for 10 hours in bed) significantly improved physical performance, reaction time, and mood in elite athletes."

                "Shortened REM Latency (entering the first REM cycle too quickly)",
                "A complete absence of Stage 2 sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with depression often enter their first REM cycle significantly faster than healthy controls (shortened REM latency) and have increased REM density throughout the night."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "When working with clients suffering from Post-Viral Fatigue or Long COVID (L8), what is the most critical safety precaution regarding exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage 'pushing through' the fatigue to build stamina",
                "Avoid high-intensity exercise that triggers Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)",
                "Recommend at least 150 minutes of vigorous cardio per week",
                "Exercise should only be performed in a fasted state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Post-Viral Fatigue syndromes, 'pushing through' can cause a severe crash known as Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM). Pacing and staying within the 'energy envelope' is the priority."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 72-year-old client is taking multiple medications for hypertension, allergies, and bladder control. Why is 'Polypharmacy' a concern for their sleep health coach?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the client's blood too thin for sleep",
                "Many common medications for these conditions have anticholinergic effects that disrupt sleep architecture and increase fall risk",
                "Medications always increase the amount of Deep Sleep, making it hard to wake up",
                "Older adults process medications faster, meaning they need higher doses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many medications used by seniors (antihistamines, certain BP meds, bladder control) have anticholinergic properties that fragment sleep, reduce REM, and increase the risk of cognitive impairment and falls."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "For a client with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who struggles with sensory processing, which environmental intervention has shown significant clinical benefit for improving sleep duration and 'calming' the nervous system?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Weighted blankets provide Deep Pressure Touch (DPT), which can increase serotonin and decrease cortisol, helping neurodivergent individuals regulate their sensory systems for better sleep."
