                "8 hours; it means one cup of coffee lasts all day",
                "1 hour; it means caffeine has little effect on sleep architecture"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caffeine has an average half-life of 5-6 hours. This means if a client consumes 200mg at 4:00 PM, 100mg is still active at 10:00 PM, and 50mg (a quarter-life) is still present at 4:00 AM, significantly impacting sleep depth and REM."
