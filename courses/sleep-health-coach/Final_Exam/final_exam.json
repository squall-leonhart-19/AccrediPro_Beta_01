            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN, located in the hypothalamus, is the primary circadian pacemaker that regulates the timing of sleep-wake cycles based on photic input."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, high nocturnal arousal, and frequent 3:00 AM awakenings. Which pillar of the RESTORE Method™ should be the primary focus?",

            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis found that exposure to blue light (approx. 460nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin for how long compared to dim light?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evening blue light exposure is potent enough to delay the DLMO (Dim Light Melatonin Onset) by 1.5 hours or more, disrupting the circadian rhythm."

            "options": [
                "It increases REM sleep too early in the night",
                "It acts as a potent stimulant after 2 hours",

                "It lowers blood glucose to dangerous levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While alcohol is a sedative, its metabolism leads to a 'rebound effect' that fragments sleep and severely suppresses REM sleep."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep is a passive process; 'sleep effort' is a maladaptive psychological state where the client attempts to consciously control an unconscious process, usually increasing arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "With a half-life of 5-6 hours, 25% of the caffeine from a noon coffee may still be in the brain at midnight, interfering with deep sleep architecture."
