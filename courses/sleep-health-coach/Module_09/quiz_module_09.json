            "question": "Research on metabolic health (Lesson 1) indicates that restricting sleep to 4-5 hours per night for just one week can reduce insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage in healthy adults?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",
                "25-30%",
                "50-60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies, such as those by Spiegel et al., have demonstrated that short-term sleep restriction can reduce insulin sensitivity by 25-30%, a level comparable to individuals with pre-diabetes."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "When implementing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT) as part of CBT-I (Lesson 2), what is the standard protocol if a client's Sleep Efficiency (SE) exceeds 90% for the week?",
            "options": [
                "Decrease the sleep window by 15 minutes",
                "Increase the sleep window by 15-20 minutes",
                "Maintain the current window for another month",
                "Immediately return to an 8-hour sleep window"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SRT, if Sleep Efficiency is high (usually >90%), it indicates the sleep drive is strong enough to support more time in bed, so the window is increased by 15-20 minutes."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Pediatric Sleep Architecture (Lesson 3), how does the percentage of REM sleep in a newborn compare to that of a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "Newborns have 20% REM, Adults have 50% REM",
                "Newborns have 50% REM, Adults have 20-25% REM",

                "Newborns have no REM sleep until 6 months of age"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Newborns spend approximately 50% of their sleep time in REM (Active Sleep), which is critical for brain development, whereas adults typically spend 20-25% in REM."

            "question": "Geriatric Sleep Science (Lesson 4) highlights 'Phase Advancement' as a common age-related change. This typically results in which sleep pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Falling asleep at 2 AM and waking at 10 AM",

                "A total loss of the circadian rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase advancement in older adults causes the circadian clock to shift earlier, leading to early evening sleepiness and early morning spontaneous awakening."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "For a shift worker on a permanent night schedule (Lesson 5), which intervention is most effective for aligning the circadian rhythm to the work schedule?",
            "options": [
                "Avoiding all light during the night shift",
                "Bright light exposure in the first half of the shift and blue-blocking glasses during the morning commute",

                "Taking 10mg of melatonin at the start of the night shift"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategically timed bright light during the shift promotes alertness and phase shifting, while blue-blocking glasses in the morning prevent the sun from resetting the clock to 'day mode' before sleep."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Which supplement discussed in Lesson 6 is known for its ability to increase alpha brain wave activity and promote 'relaxation without sedation' by modulating GABA and Glutamate?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-Theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety by increasing alpha waves and influencing inhibitory neurotransmitters without causing daytime drowsiness."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7 on Wearable Technology, what does a consistently low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading during sleep usually signify?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal recovery and high parasympathetic tone",
                "A state of high stress, poor recovery, or sympathetic dominance",
                "The user is in a state of deep N3 sleep",
                "The wearable device is malfunctioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low HRV indicates that the autonomic nervous system is under stress (sympathetic dominance) and is not recovering effectively, whereas a high HRV indicates better parasympathetic 'rest and digest' activity."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "The 'Stimulus Control' component of CBT-I (Lesson 2) instructs clients to leave the bed if they are awake for more than 20 minutes. What is the primary psychological goal of this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the total amount of exercise the client gets",
                "To weaken the conditioned association between the bed and wakefulness/frustration",
                "To ensure the client gets at least some housework done",
                "To increase exposure to blue light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus control aims to break the 'conditioned insomnia' where the bed becomes a cue for anxiety and wakefulness rather than sleep."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "In Adolescent Sleep (Lesson 3), the 'Phase Delay' that occurs during puberty is primarily driven by which biological change?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in social media use",
                "A later release of melatonin and a slower buildup of sleep pressure (adenosine)",
                "An earlier release of cortisol in the evening",
                "A complete disappearance of REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adolescents experience a biological shift where melatonin is secreted 1-2 hours later than in children, combined with a slower accumulation of homeostatic sleep pressure."

            "options": [
                "Taking sleep medication every weekend 'just in case'",
                "Strictly adhering to an 8-hour window even if not tired",
                "Establishing a 'Buffer Zone' or wind-down routine to transition from work to sleep",
                "Using a wearable device to check sleep scores every 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Buffer Zone' (usually 30-60 minutes) allows the nervous system to transition from the sympathetic-dominant state of the day to the parasympathetic state required for sleep onset."
