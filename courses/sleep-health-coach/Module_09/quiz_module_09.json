            "question": "According to the 2017 research by Baron et al., what is the primary characteristic of 'Orthosomnia'?",
            "options": [
                "A physiological inability to enter Stage 3 NREM sleep",
                "A perfectionistic quest for 'ideal' sleep driven by wearable device data",
                "The clinical requirement for exactly 8.5 hours of sleep to maintain health",
                "A circadian rhythm disorder caused by excessive blue light exposure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orthosomnia describes a condition where individuals become preoccupied with achieving 'perfect' sleep data from wearable trackers, often leading to increased anxiety and worsening sleep quality."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Sleep Effort,' why is the intentional 'trying' to fall asleep considered paradoxical?",
            "options": [
                "It increases adenosine buildup too rapidly",
                "It activates the Sympathetic Nervous System, which is incompatible with sleep onset",
                "It causes the body to skip the REM cycle entirely",
                "It lowers the core body temperature too quickly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep is a passive process controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Active 'effort' triggers the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight), creating the hyperarousal that prevents sleep."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A client scores high on the DBAS-16 scale, specifically agreeing that 'I must get 8 hours of sleep to function.' Which cognitive reframing technique is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Instructing the client to drink more caffeine to prove they can function",
                "Validating that 8 hours is the biological minimum for all adults",
                "Decatastrophizing by examining 'best-case' vs 'worst-case' functional outcomes of a 6-hour night",
                "Prescribing a 2-hour afternoon nap to make up the deficit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing involves challenging maladaptive beliefs (like the 8-hour myth) and decatastrophizing the consequences of poor sleep to reduce performance anxiety."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Stimulus Control Therapy (SCT) is based on which psychological principle to strengthen the association between the bed and sleep?",
            "options": [
                "Operant Conditioning",
                "Classical Conditioning",

                "Social Learning Theory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCT uses classical conditioning to re-associate the bed with sleep and sleepiness rather than frustration, wakefulness, or worry."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "If a client’s sleep diary shows they spend 9 hours in bed but only sleep for 6 hours (Sleep Efficiency of 66%), what is the standard starting 'Sleep Window' for Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT)?",
            "options": [
                "4 hours",
                "6 hours",
                "8 hours",
                "9 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial SRT window is typically set to the client's average total sleep time (6 hours), though most clinicians do not set a window shorter than 5 to 5.5 hours for safety."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "During the 'Creative Hopelessness' phase of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), what is the coach's primary goal?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client feel hopeless about ever sleeping again",
                "To demonstrate that the client's previous struggle-based strategies have failed",

                "To explain the neurobiology of the hypothalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creative Hopelessness helps the client realize that their 'struggle' against insomnia is actually what keeps it alive, opening them up to the alternative of acceptance."

            "id": "q9_7",

                "Setting an alarm for the same time every morning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-striving is the act of being present without an agenda. In sleep coaching, this means practicing mindfulness without the immediate expectation that it must result in sleep."

            "id": "q9_8",

                "Stay in bed and try harder to relax",
                "Check their phone to see if they missed any notifications",
                "Leave the bedroom and engage in a quiet, low-arousal activity in dim light",
                "Perform a high-intensity workout to tire themselves out"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core rule of SCT is to leave the bed when unable to sleep to prevent the association of the bed with wakeful frustration."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis of CBT-I components found that which two interventions had the largest effect sizes for reducing Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control (SCT) and Sleep Restriction (SRT) are consistently identified as the most potent 'active ingredients' in cognitive behavioral interventions for insomnia."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "To build long-term psychological resilience, how should a coach help a client frame a 'bad night' of sleep after the program ends?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign of total relapse that requires restarting the entire 12-week program",
                "As a temporary 'lapse' or 'speedbump' that is a normal part of the human experience",
                "As a medical emergency requiring immediate pharmacological intervention",
                "As evidence that the client's brain is permanently damaged"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resilience is built by reframing occasional poor sleep as a 'lapse' rather than a 'relapse,' reducing the catastrophic thinking that triggers a new cycle of chronic insomnia."
