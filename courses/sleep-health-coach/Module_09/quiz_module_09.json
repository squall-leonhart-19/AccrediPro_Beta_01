            "question": "According to research on metabolic health, even a single night of partial sleep deprivation (approx. 4 hours) can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "25-30%", "45-50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A landmark study by Donga et al. (2010) demonstrated that a single night of partial sleep restriction induces insulin resistance in healthy subjects by approximately 25-30%, affecting glucose metabolism significantly."

            "question": "A client is undergoing Sleep Restriction Therapy (SRT). They report spending 9 hours in bed but only sleeping for 6 hours. What is their Sleep Efficiency (SE), and what is the standard clinical recommendation based on this SE?",
            "options": [
                "SE is 66%; the Sleep Window should be compressed.",
                "SE is 75%; the Sleep Window should remain the same.",
                "SE is 66%; the Sleep Window should be expanded.",
                "SE is 80%; the Sleep Window should be compressed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sleep Efficiency is calculated as (Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed) x 100. Here, 6/9 = 66.6%. In CBT-I protocols, if SE is below 85%, the time in bed is typically restricted (compressed) to match the actual sleep time."

            "question": "In pediatric sleep architecture, how does the percentage of REM (Active) sleep in a full-term newborn compare to that of a healthy adult?",
            "options": [
                "Newborns spend 20% in REM; Adults spend 50%.",
                "Newborns spend 50% in REM; Adults spend 20-25%.",
                "Newborns spend 80% in REM; Adults spend 20-25%.",
                "Both newborns and adults spend approximately 25% in REM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Newborns spend roughly 50% of their sleep time in 'Active Sleep' (the precursor to REM), whereas healthy adults typically spend 20-25% of their night in REM sleep."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Geriatric populations often experience 'Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome.' Which physiological shift primarily contributes to this phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "A delay in the timing of core body temperature minimum.",
                "An increase in the production of growth hormone during N3.",
                "An earlier evening rise in melatonin and earlier morning temperature nadir.",
                "A complete loss of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) function."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging is associated with a 'phase advance,' where the circadian clock shifts earlier. This results in earlier melatonin secretion and an earlier core body temperature minimum, causing seniors to feel sleepy earlier and wake up earlier."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "When coaching a shift worker using the 'Anchor Sleep' strategy, what is the primary objective?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client sleeps 8 hours immediately after every shift.",
                "To maintain a consistent 4-hour sleep block at the same time every day, regardless of shift timing.",
                "To use caffeine during the 'Forbidden Zone' to prevent sleepiness.",
                "To rotate shifts clockwise every 2 days to maximize circadian adaptation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchor sleep involves identifying a 4-hour block (e.g., 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM) that the worker can keep consistent across both work days and off days to help stabilize the circadian rhythm."

            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Nocebo' effect often seen in clients using wearable sleep trackers (Orthosomnia)?",
            "options": [
                "Improved sleep quality due to increased awareness of sleep stages.",
                "Anxiety-induced sleep disruption caused by negative data or perceived poor scores from the device.",
                "The device's ability to accurately predict sleep apnea before a clinical study.",
                "The physiological synchronization of the heart rate with the device's sensors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orthosomnia is a clinical term for the preoccupation with achieving 'perfect' wearable data. The Nocebo effect occurs when a user sees a 'poor' sleep score and consequently feels more fatigued or performs worse, regardless of their actual physiological sleep quality."

            "question": "A client is traveling East across 6 time zones. According to jet lag protocols, when should they seek bright light exposure to accelerate phase advancement?",
            "options": [
                "In the late evening of the destination time zone.",
                "In the early morning of the destination time zone.",
                "Only during the flight to prevent melatonin suppression.",
                "Between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM destination time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To advance the circadian clock (traveling East), bright light should be sought in the destination's early morning, which helps pull the circadian rhythm forward to match the new local time."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Long-term use of Benzodiazepine Receptor Agonists (BZRAs) for sleep is clinically associated with which change in sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "Increased N3 (Slow Wave Sleep) and increased REM.",
                "Increased REM density and decreased N1.",
                "Decreased N3 (Slow Wave Sleep) and decreased REM sleep.",
                "No significant change in sleep architecture compared to natural sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pharmacological interventions like benzodiazepines often increase Stage N2 sleep but typically suppress N3 (Deep Sleep) and REM sleep, leading to a less restorative sleep structure despite increased total sleep time."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Sleep Resilience,' what does the 'Buffer Zone' refer to in a coaching protocol?",
            "options": [
                "The 15-minute period used for Sleep Restriction Therapy.",
                "A 60-90 minute period of cognitive wind-down before the scheduled sleep window.",

                "The physiological limit of caffeine clearance in the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Buffer Zone is a critical maintenance strategy where the client dedicates 60-90 minutes before bed to non-stimulating activities, effectively separating the stressors of the day from the sleep environment."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Which specific hormone, when elevated due to chronic short sleep, increases appetite and a preference for high-calorie, carbohydrate-dense foods?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin",
                "Ghrelin",
                "Melatonin",
                "Adenosine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation leads to an increase in Ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and a decrease in Leptin (the satiety hormone). This hormonal shift significantly increases cravings for calorie-dense foods."
