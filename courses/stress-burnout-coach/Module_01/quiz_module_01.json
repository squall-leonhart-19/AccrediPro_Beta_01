            "question": "According to Hans Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS), which stage is characterized by the body attempting to return to homeostasis while remaining on high alert?",
            "options": ["The Alarm Reaction Stage", "The Resistance Stage", "The Exhaustion Stage", "The Recovery Stage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Resistance Stage, the body attempts to adapt to the stressor. While the initial 'alarm' surge subsides, cortisol levels remain elevated as the system stays on high alert to maintain functioning."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) identifies three core dimensions of burnout. Which dimension is characterized by a cynical, detached response to one's work or clients?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog,' social withdrawal, and a feeling of being 'numb' or 'paralyzed.' According to Polyvagal Theory, which state of the nervous system are they likely inhabiting?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)", "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)", "Dorsal Vagal (Freeze/Shutdown)", "Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Activation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the oldest evolutionary response, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and energy conservation (the 'freeze' response) when the system perceives a life-threatening or overwhelming threat."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Research on chronic stress has shown that prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol can lead to physical changes in the brain. Which area is most likely to experience atrophy (shrinkage)?",
            "options": ["The Amygdala", "The Hippocampus", "The Prefrontal Cortex", "Both the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to atrophy in the Hippocampus (affecting memory) and the Prefrontal Cortex (affecting executive function), while often causing the Amygdala (the fear center) to become enlarged and hyper-reactive."

            "id": "q1_5",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On the PSS-10, scores from 0-13 are low, 14-26 are moderate, and 27-40 are considered high perceived stress, indicating a significant need for intervention."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client states: 'Because I didn't finish the entire report today, the whole project is going to fail and I'll probably get fired.' Which two cognitive distortions are primarily at play here?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client is using 'All-or-Nothing Thinking' (viewing the unfinished report as a total failure) and 'Catastrophizing' (predicting the worst possible outcome: getting fired)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value Incongruence occurs when there is a gap between an individual's personal values and the values/actions of their organization. This leads to a sense of 'moral injury' and deep psychological erosion, a hallmark of burnout."
