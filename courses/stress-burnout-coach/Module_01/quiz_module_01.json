            "question": "According to the ICD-11 definition adopted by the World Health Organization, which of the following is a primary requirement for a clinical 'Burnout' classification?",
            "options": [
                "The symptoms must be present in all areas of the client's life, including home and social settings.",
                "The phenomenon is defined specifically as an occupational phenomenon and should not be applied to other life areas.",
                "The client must demonstrate a total absence of cortisol production in a 24-hour period.",
                "The symptoms must have persisted for a minimum of 24 months without interruption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHO ICD-11 explicitly defines burnout as an occupational phenomenon resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is specifically distinguished from conditions that manifest in other life domains."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During the HPA Axis activation, which hormone is released by the hypothalamus to stimulate the anterior pituitary gland?",
            "options": [
                "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)",
                "Epinephrine",
                "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)",
                "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis sequence begins with the hypothalamus releasing CRH, which then signals the pituitary to release ACTH, which finally signals the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "McEwen’s model of 'Allostatic Load' suggests that chronic wear and tear on the body occurs when:",
            "options": [
                "The body remains in a state of 'Allostasis' for too long without returning to homeostasis.",
                "The HPA axis is never activated during stressful events.",
                "Cortisol levels are consistently too high, but only during the night.",
                "The client experiences a single, acute stressor followed by a long recovery period."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is the cumulative cost to the body of maintaining stability (allostasis) through change. It occurs when the stress response is chronically activated or fails to shut off."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is typically characterized by what percentage increase in cortisol levels within 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-25%",
                "35-60%",
                "Over 200%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust and healthy CAR shows a 35-60% rise in cortisol levels shortly after waking, reflecting the body's preparation for the day's demands."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the 'Three Stages of Burnout' discussed in Lesson 5, which stage is characterized by 'depersonalization' and a cynical attitude toward clients or colleagues?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1: The Honeymoon Phase",
                "Stage 2: Stagnation and Frustration",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stage 2 (Stagnation/Frustration) is where the initial enthusiasm wanes and is replaced by cynicism, irritability, and the beginning of depersonalization."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "How does chronic stress contribute to systemic inflammation through the mechanism of 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Resistance' (GCR)?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol becomes so potent that it destroys all white blood cells.",
                "Immune cells lose their sensitivity to cortisol's anti-inflammatory signals, allowing pro-inflammatory cytokines to proliferate.",
                "The body stops producing IL-6 entirely.",
                "Cortisol binds to insulin receptors, causing immediate systemic swelling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, immune cells can downregulate their receptors for cortisol. Because cortisol is normally anti-inflammatory, this 'resistance' means the body can no longer effectively 'turn off' the inflammatory response."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Mitochondrial Allostatic Load (MAL) refers to the structural and functional changes in mitochondria due to chronic stress. What is a primary outcome of MAL?",
            "options": [
                "Increased ATP production to meet higher energy demands.",
                "Mitochondrial fusion and increased organelle size.",
                "Increased release of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA), which acts as a pro-inflammatory signal.",
                "Complete immunity to oxidative stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When mitochondria are overstressed, they can fragment and leak mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol or bloodstream, which the immune system perceives as a 'danger signal,' triggering further inflammation."

            "options": [
                "To conduct deep-dive psychological trauma processing.",
                "To implement immediate lifestyle 'quick wins' to reduce acute sympathetic dominance and restore basic physiological safety.",
                "To prescribe high-dose botanical supplements for cortisol suppression.",
                "To finalize the client's exit strategy from their current career."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization focuses on moving the client out of a state of constant 'fight or flight' by establishing safety and physiological regulation before moving into deeper cognitive or emotional work."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'flat' diurnal cortisol curve, where morning levels are low and evening levels are slightly elevated. Based on Lesson 4, this pattern is most likely associated with:",
            "options": [
                "Acute, short-term stress response.",
                "High resilience and optimal HPA function.",

                "Excessive caffeine consumption in the morning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat or blunted diurnal curve, particularly with low morning cortisol, is a hallmark of the later stages of burnout and chronic allostatic load."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "According to the research cited in Lesson 6, chronic stress-induced elevations in which cytokine are most strongly correlated with 'sickness behavior' and depressive symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)",
                "Vitamin D3",

                "Oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "IL-6 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that, when chronically elevated due to stress, can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce symptoms of fatigue, anhedonia, and social withdrawal."
