            "question": "In the context of optimizing nutrition for burnout (L1), which micronutrient is considered the 'anti-stress mineral' due to its role in regulating the HPA axis and inhibiting excessive cortisol release?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Zinc",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium plays a critical role in the HPA axis by acting as a gatekeeper for NMDA receptors and limiting the release of ACTH, effectively dampening the physiological stress response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the Ikigai model, the intersection of skill (what you are good at) and economic viability (what you can be paid for) is defined as your Profession."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A client struggles with 'porous boundaries,' leading to emotional contagion and burnout. Which advanced boundary-setting strategy (L3) involves identifying the 'internal gatekeeper' to manage emotional labor?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Differentiated Self-Regulation allows a practitioner to remain empathetic without absorbing the client's emotional state, a key skill in preventing burnout from emotional labor."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Neuroplasticity research (L4) indicates that chronic burnout often leads to atrophy in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and hypertrophy in which other brain structure?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress causes the amygdala (the brain's fear center) to become enlarged and hyper-reactive, while the PFC (rational thinking) and Hippocampus (memory) tend to shrink."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "The 'Buffering Hypothesis' in social support theory (L5) suggests that social connections are most effective for burnout resilience when they:",

                "Eliminate the stressor entirely",
                "Provide financial assistance only",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Buffering Hypothesis states that social support protects (buffers) individuals from the negative health effects of high stress, though it may have less impact during low-stress periods."

            "id": "q13_6",

            "options": [
                "Melatonin",
                "Cortisol",

                "GABA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adenosine is a byproduct of cellular energy consumption; its accumulation creates the drive to sleep, which is why caffeine (an adenosine antagonist) keeps us awake."

            "question": "When integrating movement for a client in Stage 4 Burnout (L7), why is high-intensity interval training (HIIT) often contraindicated initially?",
            "options": [
                "It burns too many calories",
                "It can further spike cortisol in an already exhausted HPA axis",
                "It requires too much coordination",
                "It decreases BDNF levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In advanced burnout, the HPA axis is dysregulated. HIIT is a significant physiological stressor that can exacerbate cortisol imbalances and lead to a 'crash' rather than recovery."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 emphasizes 'Habit Stacking' for long-term resilience. If a client wants to implement a 5-minute meditation, what is the most effective way to 'stack' it?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking (After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]) utilizes existing neural pathways to make the adoption of new, resilient behaviors more automatic."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module found that individuals with high levels of 'Instrumental Support' had a ____ lower risk of burnout compared to those with only emotional support.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Instrumental support (tangible help with tasks) provides a significant 31% reduction in burnout risk by directly reducing the objective workload or stressor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is when the brain processes emotional experiences, stripping away the 'emotional charge' from memories to facilitate psychological recovery."
