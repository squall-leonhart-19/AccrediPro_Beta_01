            "question": "In the RESTORE Protocol, what is the primary objective of the 'Stabilize' phase (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the root cause of childhood trauma",
                "To regulate the nervous system and move the client out of a chronic dorsal vagal state",
                "To implement high-intensity interval training to boost endorphins",
                "To finalize the client's career transition plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilize phase focuses on nervous system regulation, specifically using tools to transition a client from a state of shutdown (dorsal vagal) or hyper-arousal (sympathetic) into the ventral vagal 'safe and social' state."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Evaluate' lesson (L3), a 'flat' diurnal cortisol slope—where morning levels are low and evening levels remain unchanged—is most indicative of which condition?",
            "options": [
                "Acute stress response",
                "Early-stage 'wired and tired' pattern",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flattened diurnal cortisol curve, characterized by a lack of the typical morning peak (CAR) and high evening levels, is a clinical hallmark of chronic burnout and HPA-axis exhaustion."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the 'Transform' phase (L5), the 'Cost of the Yes' exercise is primarily used to address which burnout-promoting behavior?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Cost of the Yes' helps clients realize that every 'yes' to an external demand is a 'no' to their own recovery, health, or boundaries, which is essential for cognitive transformation."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "During the 'Recognize' phase (L2), a coach identifies that a client is in Stage 5 of the Freudenberger Burnout Scale. What is the defining characteristic of this stage?",

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 42-year-old executive, presents with 'tired but wired' energy at night and frequent 3:00 AM wakings. Which 'Evaluate' (L3) intervention is most appropriate first?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms suggest a cortisol spike at night; assessing her diurnal rhythm is the necessary first step to tailor a stabilization plan."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "The 'Reclaim' phase (L7) utilizes the 'Values-Action Gap' analysis. What does this tool measure?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Values-Action Gap identifies where a client's life is misaligned with their core purpose, which is a major driver of existential burnout."

                "Micro-recoveries are only for physical health; Macro-recoveries are for mental health",
                "Micro-recoveries occur during the workday (short breaks); Macro-recoveries occur during non-work time (vacations/weekends)",
                "Micro-recoveries require a coach; Macro-recoveries are self-led",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-recoveries (like 5-minute breathing) happen during work to prevent stress accumulation, while Macro-recoveries happen outside of work to restore total energy reserves."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Controlled breathing techniques like Box Breathing stimulate the Vagus nerve, which signals the brain to move from 'fight or flight' into 'rest and digest' mode."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Optimize' (L6) data, what percentage of burnout recovery is attributed to 'Sleep Hygiene and Circadian Alignment'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that restoring the circadian rhythm and sleep quality is the foundational 'pillar' of recovery, accounting for the majority of physiological symptom improvement."
