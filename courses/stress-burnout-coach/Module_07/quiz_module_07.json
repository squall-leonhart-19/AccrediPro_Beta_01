            "question": "According to the Progressive Load Method, what is the recommended initial workload capacity for a client returning to a high-demand professional role after severe burnout?",
            "options": [
                "25-30% of previous peak capacity",
                "50% of previous peak capacity",
                "75% of previous peak capacity",
                "100% capacity with frequent breaks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 recommends starting at 25-30% capacity to prevent immediate HPA-axis reactivation and allow for the 'titration' of stress loads."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Self-Determination Theory (SDT) identifies three 'nutrients' for intrinsic motivation. Which of these is essential for a client to feel they have mastery over their environment?",
            "options": [
                "Autonomy",
                "Competence",
                "Relatedness",
                "Financial Incentives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Competence is the need to feel effective in one's interactions with the social environment and to experience opportunities to exercise and express one's capacities."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In Flow State science, what is the 'Golden Ratio' or 'Challenge-Skill Balance' required to enter flow without triggering an anxiety response?",
            "options": [
                "Skills must be 50% higher than the challenge",
                "The challenge must be exactly equal to the skill level",
                "The challenge should be approximately 4% greater than the current skill level",
                "The challenge should be 20% greater than the current skill level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research by Csikszentmihalyi and later refined by the Flow Research Collective suggests that a challenge roughly 4% beyond current skills is the 'sweet spot' for flow."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological mechanism behind 'Strategic Micro-Dosing' of stress (Hormesis)?",
            "options": [
                "It induces mild cellular stress that triggers up-regulation of protective and repair mechanisms",
                "It shuts down the sympathetic nervous system entirely",
                "It increases resting heart rate to improve cardiovascular fitness",
                "It eliminates cortisol from the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is a dose-response phenomenon where low doses of a stressor stimulate biological systems to become more resilient to future high-level stressors."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "When re-establishing exercise protocols post-burnout, why is Zone 2 aerobic training prioritized over High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)?",
            "options": [
                "HIIT is too boring for clients with low dopamine",
                "Zone 2 training decreases mitochondrial density",
                "HIIT can cause excessive sympathetic 'overdrive' and spike cortisol levels that the recovering system cannot yet buffer",
                "Zone 2 training is only for elite athletes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 explains that HIIT can be a massive 'withdrawal' from the metabolic bank account; Zone 2 builds the aerobic base and improves parasympathetic tone without the high cortisol cost."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "To rebuild cognitive stamina, a coach introduces 'Intermittent Focus Blocks.' What is the recommended starting duration for these blocks for a client with lingering 'brain fog'?",
            "options": [
                "90 minutes of deep work",
                "15-20 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute 'neural rest' period",
                "5 minutes of work followed by 20 minutes of rest",
                "4 hours of continuous work with no breaks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 suggests starting with shorter blocks (15-20 minutes) to rebuild the 'prefrontal cortex muscle' without causing neural fatigue or frustration."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "In the context of social re-engagement, what does the concept of 'Emotional Contagion' imply for a recovering burnout client?",
            "options": [
                "They should only interact with people who have also experienced burnout",
                "They should avoid all social interaction for at least 12 months",
                "They are highly susceptible to the negative emotional states of others, making boundary setting critical",
                "They can 'catch' burnout from their coworkers through physical contact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recovering clients often have a sensitized nervous system; 'Emotional Contagion' means they can easily absorb the stress or negativity of others, requiring strategic social boundaries."

        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis on burnout recurrence found that 'The Relapse Gap'—the period of highest risk for secondary burnout—typically occurs when?",
            "options": [
                "In the first 48 hours of returning to work",
                "3-6 months after a client returns to full-time hours and 'feels' recovered",
                "Exactly one year after the initial burnout diagnosis",
                "Only if the client changes industries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Relapse Gap occurs when the initial 'honeymoon' phase of returning ends, and the client begins to neglect their new recovery habits because they feel 'healed.'"

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Client 'Mark' is returning to his role as a software engineer. He is eager to prove himself and wants to skip the 'Micro-Dosing' phase of stress. What is the most evidence-based coaching response?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage his enthusiasm and let him work overtime immediately",
                "Tell him he is not allowed to work for another six months",
                "Explain that 'titrating' stress prevents the 'kindling effect,' where the nervous system overreacts to small stressors",
                "Advise him to only work on weekends"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'kindling effect' refers to the nervous system becoming increasingly sensitive to stress; gradual titration (micro-dosing) is the antidote to this sensitization."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which neurochemical combination is most characteristic of the 'Flow State' during high-performance tasks?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol and Adrenaline only",
                "Dopamine, Anandamide, and Norepinephrine",
                "Melatonin and Serotonin",
                "Insulin and Glucagon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flow is characterized by a specific 'cocktail' of performance-enhancing neurochemicals (Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Endorphins, Anandamide, and Serotonin) that increase focus and reduce the perception of effort."
