            "question": "Which ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids is most associated with a significant reduction in systemic inflammation and improved nervous system resilience?",
            "options": [
                "15:1",
                "10:1",
                "4:1 or lower",
                "20:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern Western diets often reach 15:1 or 20:1, which is pro-inflammatory. Research indicates that a ratio of 4:1 or lower is necessary to reduce C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels and support neuroprotection."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'crash' 2 hours after a high-carb meal, accompanied by sudden anxiety and heart palpitations. What is the physiological cause?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive insulin causing reactive hypoglycemia, triggering a compensatory cortisol and adrenaline spike",
                "A sudden drop in serotonin due to lack of protein",
                "The 'Thermal Effect of Food' causing a sympathetic nervous system overload",
                "Dehydration caused by the osmotic pull of glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When blood sugar drops rapidly (reactive hypoglycemia), the body perceives a survival threat and releases cortisol and adrenaline to trigger gluconeogenesis, which manifests as anxiety symptoms."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In clinical trials of KSM-66 Ashwagandha, what was the average percentage reduction in serum cortisol levels observed in chronically stressed adults over a 60-day period?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "27-30%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on KSM-66 Ashwagandha extract consistently show a reduction in serum cortisol levels of approximately 27-30% compared to placebo groups."

            "question": "Why is Magnesium Glycinate specifically recommended over Magnesium Oxide for clients in the 'Wired and Tired' stage of burnout?",
            "options": [
                "It has a powerful laxative effect to clear toxins",
                "It is the only form that can cross the blood-brain barrier",
                "The glycine conjugate acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, providing an additional calming effect on the NMDA receptors",
                "It is more acidic and helps with protein digestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Glycinate is highly bioavailable and the amino acid glycine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, enhancing the calming effect on the nervous system and improving sleep quality."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on caffeine, what is the 'adenosine rebound' and how does it contribute to burnout retention?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden increase in energy after caffeine wears off",
                "Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors; when it metabolizes, the accumulated adenosine floods receptors, causing a massive energy crash",
                "The process where caffeine increases the production of new adenosine receptors over time",
                "The immediate excretion of electrolytes through the kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caffeine doesn't provide energy; it masks fatigue by blocking adenosine. When it wears off, the high levels of accumulated adenosine bind to receptors simultaneously, leading to a severe 'crash' that often prompts more caffeine use."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis highlighted that even 'mild' dehydration, defined as a loss of ____ body mass, can increase cortisol levels and significantly impair executive function.",
            "options": [
                "1%",
                "2%",
                "5%",
                "10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that a 2% loss in body water mass is the threshold where cognitive performance, mood regulation, and hormonal balance (cortisol) begin to degrade significantly."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "For a client in Stage 3 Burnout (Exhaustion), why is High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) often contraindicated?",
            "options": [
                "It burns too many calories",
                "It requires too much coordination",
                "The high intensity places an excessive demand on an already depleted HPA axis, potentially worsening mitochondrial dysfunction",
                "It increases muscle mass too quickly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In late-stage burnout, the HPA axis is dysregulated. High-intensity exercise acts as a major physiological stressor that can further deplete cortisol reserves and exacerbate the 'crash' rather than building resilience."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "What is the specific wavelength of blue light (typically emitted by screens) that most aggressively suppresses the release of melatonin from the pineal gland?",
            "options": [
                "300-350 nm",
                "450-480 nm",
                "600-650 nm",
                "800-850 nm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are most sensitive to blue light in the 450-480 nm range, which signals the brain to suppress melatonin and remain in a state of high alertness."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "The 'Psychobiotic' effect refers to specific probiotic strains that support stress resilience by:",
            "options": [
                "Killing all bad bacteria in the small intestine",
                "Producing neuroactive substances like GABA and Serotonin, and modulating the vagus nerve",
                "Increasing the acidity of the stomach to digest B-vitamins",
                "Preventing the absorption of dietary fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychobiotics are probiotics (like L. helveticus and B. longum) that, when ingested in adequate amounts, produce a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness or chronic stress by influencing the gut-brain axis."

            "question": "Case Study: 'David' presents with chronic fatigue but cannot fall asleep until 2 AM. He works in a windowless office. What is the most effective first-step 'Light Hygiene' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Buying a standing desk",
                "Taking a Vitamin D supplement at night",
                "15-30 minutes of direct sunlight exposure (or a 10,000 lux lamp) within 30 minutes of waking",
                "Wearing sunglasses all day to rest the eyes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Morning sunlight exposure anchors the circadian rhythm, triggering the timely suppression of melatonin and the 'start' of the internal clock, which ensures melatonin is released 12-14 hours later for sleep."
