    {
      "letter": "A",
      "meaning": "Assessment of Allostatic Load",
      "description": "The practitioner begins by quantifying the client's cumulative biological wear and tear through a comprehensive biopsychosocial audit. This phase identifies the specific physiological, environmental, and psychological stressors contributing to the client's current state of exhaustion."
    },
    {
      "letter": "S",
      "meaning": "Somatic Nervous System Regulation",
      "description": "This step focuses on moving the client from a state of sympathetic dominance (fight/flight) to parasympathetic recovery through evidence-based somatic tools. Techniques include vagal nerve stimulation, breathwork protocols, and polyvagal theory applications to restore autonomic balance."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "meaning": "Cognitive & Emotional Reframing",
      "description": "Coaches address the internal drivers of burnout, such as perfectionism, high-functioning anxiety, and cognitive distortions. By restructuring the client's mental response to external pressure, we create a psychological buffer against future stressors."
    },
    {
      "letter": "E",
      "meaning": "Energy & Vitality Optimization",
      "description": "Burnout is often a biological energy crisis, so this phase prioritizes mitochondrial health, circadian rhythm alignment, and nutrient-dense recovery protocols. We transition the client from 'coping' to 'thriving' by optimizing the physiological foundations of energy production."
    },
    {
      "letter": "N",
      "meaning": "Network & Boundary Architecture",
      "description": "Sustainable recovery requires a redesign of the client's social and professional ecosystems. This principle involves establishing high-level boundary-setting skills and auditing social networks to ensure the environment supports long-term resilience rather than depletion."
    },
    {
      "letter": "D",
      "meaning": "Durable Resilience Integration",
      "description": "The final stage ensures the client becomes 'anti-fragile' by integrating stress-shielding habits into their daily identity. We establish a maintenance framework that allows the client to handle increased complexity and pressure without returning to a state of burnout."
