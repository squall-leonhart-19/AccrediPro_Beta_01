                "Empowerment, Voice, and Choice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed coaching focuses on safety, transparency, and empowerment. Cathartic emotional regression is a therapeutic technique that falls outside the scope of coaching and can be re-traumatizing if not managed by a licensed therapist."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a strong dose-response relationship between ACEs and health; those with a score of 4 or higher are 3.9 times more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), highlighting the physiological impact of early trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Shadow consists of aspects of the self that have been suppressed or denied. In burnout coaching, this often includes the 'Inner Achiever' or 'People Pleaser' that drives a client to exhaustion to maintain a specific self-image."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client shows signs of clinical trauma (flashbacks, inability to function), it is an ethical requirement to refer them to a therapist, as coaches work with functional individuals on future-oriented goals."
