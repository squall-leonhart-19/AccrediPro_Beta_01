            "question": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is considered the gold standard for assessing burnout. Which three dimensions does it specifically measure?",
            "options": [
                "Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Personal Accomplishment",
                "Physical Fatigue, Cognitive Decline, and Social Withdrawal",
                "Anxiety, Depression, and Somatic Complaints",
                "Workload, Control, and Reward"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MBI assesses burnout through three subscales: Emotional Exhaustion (feelings of being overextended), Depersonalization (cynical/detached response to the job), and Personal Accomplishment (feelings of competence and achievement)."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "When measuring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as an objective marker of stress, what does a high Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic sympathetic nervous system dominance",
                "Strong parasympathetic 'vagal tone' and better stress resilience",
                "An immediate risk of cardiovascular event",
                "Ineffective cognitive coping mechanisms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher HRV (specifically RMSSD) reflects greater parasympathetic activity and the body's ability to recover from stress. Low HRV is associated with chronic stress and poor autonomic flexibility."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Triangulation' method of assessment discussed in Lesson 1, which three data sources should a coach combine for a comprehensive profile?",
            "options": [
                "Social media activity, employer reviews, and spouse interviews",
                "Subjective reports, objective physiological data, and behavioral observations",
                "Financial records, medical history, and genetic testing",
                "Past trauma, current diet, and future career goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation involves validating subjective self-reports (questionnaires) with objective markers (like HRV/Cortisol) and the coach's direct observations of the client's behavior and affect."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), what is a healthy physiological response within the first 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "A sharp decline of 50% in cortisol levels",
                "A steady state with no change from waking levels",
                "A 50-75% increase in cortisol levels to prepare the body for the day",
                "An immediate spike followed by a 4-hour plateau"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 50-75% increase in cortisol shortly after waking. A 'blunted' response (minimal rise) is often a marker of chronic burnout and HPA-axis exhaustion."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client scores high on 'External Locus of Control' during a cognitive assessment. What does this suggest about their stress experience?",
            "options": [
                "They believe they have total control over all life outcomes",
                "They feel their stress is caused by luck, fate, or powerful others, leading to higher helplessness",
                "They are highly motivated to change their environment",
                "They have high self-efficacy and low physiological reactivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An external locus of control is the belief that outside forces determine one's fate. In stress coaching, this is linked to higher levels of perceived stress and a lower perceived ability to cope."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, when does 'burnout' most likely occur in the workplace?",
            "options": [
                "When job demands are high and job resources are also high",
                "When job demands are low, regardless of resources",
                "When high job demands are paired with low job resources",
                "Only when social support is the only resource provided"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The JD-R model posits that burnout occurs when job demands (stressors) exceed the available job resources (autonomy, support, feedback) needed to manage those demands."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "During an initial evaluation, a client reports persistent feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of self-harm. What is the ethical requirement for the Stress & Burnout Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the frequency of coaching sessions to provide more support",
                "Administer a more detailed stress questionnaire to find the root cause",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional or emergency services",
                "Suggest a change in diet and exercise to boost serotonin naturally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation and clinical depression are 'red flags' that fall outside the scope of coaching. Coaches must have a referral protocol for clinical intervention in these cases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which specific score on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) is generally considered an indicator of 'High Perceived Stress'?",
            "options": [
                "0-6",
                "7-13",
                "14-26",
                "27-40"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "On the PSS-10, scores from 0-13 are considered low stress, 14-26 are moderate stress, and scores from 27-40 are considered high perceived stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "What is 'Data Discordance' in the context of interpreting client assessment results?",
            "options": [
                "When two different coaches disagree on a client's profile",
                "When a client's subjective stress report does not match their objective physiological markers",
                "When a client lies on their intake forms",
                "When the software used to track HRV malfunctions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data discordance occurs when, for example, a client reports feeling 'fine' (low subjective stress) but their HRV is extremely low (high physiological stress). This suggests a lack of interoceptive awareness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When assessing lifestyle factors, why is 'Sleep Hygiene' prioritized in burnout evaluation?",
            "options": [
                "Because sleep is the only way to lower cortisol",
                "Because poor sleep impairs the prefrontal cortex's ability to regulate the amygdala, increasing emotional reactivity",
                "Because clients enjoy talking about sleep more than exercise",
                "Because sleep duration is the only metric that matters for health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation weakens the top-down control of the prefrontal cortex over the amygdala, making clients more reactive to minor stressors and hindering the recovery process."
