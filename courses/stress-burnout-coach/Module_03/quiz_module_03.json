            "question": "According to Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory, which state is characterized by immobilization, metabolic conservation, and a significant drop in heart rate and blood pressure?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal Complex (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic Adrenal Medullary (SAM) Axis",
                "Dorsal Vagal Complex (Freeze/Shutdown)",
                "Enteric Nervous System (Gut-Brain)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal Complex is the most primitive part of the vagus nerve, responsible for the 'freeze' or 'faint' response when the system perceives a life-threatening situation it cannot escape."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a consistently low Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reading. Based on the module content, what does this statistically indicate regarding their Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)?",
            "options": [
                "Strong parasympathetic 'vagal brake' and high resilience",
                "Sympathetic dominance and a reduced capacity for autonomic flexibility",
                "A healthy balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches",
                "Excessive ventral vagal activation leading to social over-engagement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a key biomarker for sympathetic dominance (stress) and indicates that the nervous system is stuck in a 'fight-or-flight' state with low adaptive capacity."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which breathwork protocol is specifically designed to maximize 'Coherence' by balancing the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches at approximately 5.5 breaths per minute?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resonant Frequency Breathing (typically 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute) creates a state of 'coherence' where the heart rate, respiration, and blood pressure rhythms synchronize."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "When utilizing Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) techniques, why is gargling or loud humming effective for down-regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It increases oxygen saturation in the prefrontal cortex",
                "It activates the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the ear",
                "It mechanically stimulates the laryngeal and pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve",
                "It triggers the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve innervates the vocal cords and throat muscles; the vibration from humming or the muscle action of gargling provides direct somatic stimulation to the nerve."

                "Alternating between heat and cold therapy to build resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a core SE concept where the practitioner helps the client experience small amounts of stored distress at a time to ensure the nervous system can integrate the experience without re-traumatization."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A 2021 study on the 'Physiological Sigh' (cyclic sighing) demonstrated that this specific breathing pattern is more effective for acute mood improvement than mindfulness meditation. What is the structure of this breath?",
            "options": [
                "A 4-second inhale, 4-second hold, 4-second exhale, 4-second hold",

                "A deep inhale through the nose, followed by a second short 'top-off' inhale, and a long, slow exhale through the mouth",
                "A rapid inhale through the mouth and a forceful exhale through the nose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Physiological Sigh involves a double inhale (to re-inflate the alveoli in the lungs) followed by a long exhale, which is the fastest way to offload CO2 and reduce autonomic arousal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Mammalian Dive Reflex is a survival mechanism that instantly triggers the vagus nerve to slow the heart rate and redirect blood to the brain and heart when the face is submerged in cold water."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-isometric relaxation (often used interchangeably with the effects of reciprocal inhibition in PMR) refers to the period of inhibition that follows a voluntary contraction, allowing the muscle to reach a lower baseline of tension."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 5-4-3-2-1 technique forces the brain to shift from internal distress (amygdala) to external sensory processing (prefrontal cortex), providing immediate grounding during acute stress."

                "Heat therapy is only effective if the client remains in the sauna for over 60 minutes",
                "Cold exposure should only be used for physical injury, not for nervous system regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is the biological phenomenon where a low dose of a stressor (like cold or heat) stimulates cellular repair, mitochondrial health, and nervous system resilience."
