            "question": "According to the Window of Tolerance model, what is the primary goal of stabilization techniques when a client is in a state of hyperarousal?",
            "options": [
                "To increase sympathetic nervous system activation",
                "To move the client back into their functional zone where they can process emotions",
                "To induce a state of hypoarousal for deep rest",
                "To ignore the physiological symptoms and focus on cognitive restructuring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilization aims to bring the client back into their 'Window of Tolerance'—the zone where they can effectively manage and process their experiences without being overwhelmed (hyperarousal) or shut down (hypoarousal)."

            "question": "Which physiological mechanism explains why diaphragmatic breathing reduces the stress response?",
            "options": [
                "It increases oxygen saturation to 100% instantly",
                "It stimulates the Vagus nerve, activating the Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "It forces the heart to beat faster to move blood to the brain",
                "It decreases CO2 levels to the point of mild respiratory alkalosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve passes through the diaphragm. Deep, rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing stimulates this nerve, which sends a signal to the brain to activate the 'rest and digest' (parasympathetic) system."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the context of Box Breathing (4-4-4-4), what is the specific purpose of the four-second hold after the inhalation?",
            "options": [
                "To allow for maximum CO2 expulsion",
                "To increase the heart rate for better focus",
                "To build CO2 tolerance and allow for better oxygen exchange in the cells",
                "To induce a temporary state of hypoxia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holding the breath allows CO2 to rise slightly, which is necessary for the Bohr effect—the process where oxygen is released from hemoglobin into the body's tissues and cells."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique is designed to shift brain activity from the amygdala to which other region?",
            "options": [
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By forcing the brain to look for specific sensory inputs (5 things you see, etc.), the 5-4-3-2-1 technique re-engages the Prefrontal Cortex, which is responsible for logical thinking and executive function, helping to dampen the amygdala's 'alarm' signal."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'disconnected' from their body and describes a sense of floating. Which somatic concept are they likely experiencing, and what is the intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Interoception; use high-intensity interval training",
                "Hypervigilance; use deep tissue massage",
                "Dissociation; use proprioceptive grounding like 'pushing against a wall'",
                "Neuroception; use box breathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissociation involves a lack of connection to the physical self. Proprioceptive grounding (feeling the body's position in space) helps 'anchor' the client back into their physical form."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory introduces 'Neuroception.' How is this defined in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "The conscious decision to feel safe",
                "The neural process of scanning for threats without involving the conscious mind",
                "The ability to read other people's facial expressions",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the subconscious system that constantly scans the environment for cues of safety or danger, triggering the nervous system before we are even aware of a threat."

            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the most painful physical sensation until it disappears",
                "Swinging the arms back and forth to reset the vestibular system",
                "Shifting attention between a place of physical tension and a place of relative ease or safety",
                "Holding a yoga pose for at least five minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation helps the nervous system learn to move out of a state of contraction by oscillating between an area of 'resource' (safety/ease) and an area of 'activation' (tension)."

            "options": [
                "Attending a 90-minute restorative yoga class once a week",
                "Taking 3 diaphragmatic breaths every time you open a new email tab",

                "Reading a book about stress management for an hour before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-interventions are small, frequent practices (under 1-2 minutes) attached to existing habits, which help maintain nervous system regulation throughout the day rather than waiting for a crisis."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A coach notices that every time a client attempts breathwork, they become more anxious and start to hyperventilate. What is the ethical and professional response?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client to 'push through' the anxiety to see the benefits",
                "Switch to external grounding (like the 5-4-3-2-1 technique) as they may have breath-based trauma triggers",
                "Immediately diagnose the client with a panic disorder",
                "Stop all coaching sessions and refer them to a psychiatrist for medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed coaching requires recognizing that 'standard' techniques can be triggering. If internal focus (breath) causes distress, the coach should pivot to external sensory grounding."

                "Blood glucose levels",
                "Cortisol levels and negative affect",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that diaphragmatic breathing practice leads to a significant reduction in cortisol (the primary stress hormone) and improved emotional states (negative affect)."
