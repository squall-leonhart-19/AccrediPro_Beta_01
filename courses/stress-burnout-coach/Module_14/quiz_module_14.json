            "question": "A client's Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data shows a consistently low SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) below 50ms over a 7-day period. What does this most likely indicate regarding their Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)?",
            "options": [
                "High parasympathetic tone and optimal recovery",
                "Chronic sympathetic dominance and reduced adaptive capacity",
                "A healthy balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches",
                "The client is in a 'Ventral Vagal' state of social engagement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low SDNN (typically below 50ms in clinical contexts) is a primary marker of low HRV, suggesting the body is stuck in a sympathetic 'fight-or-flight' state with poor recovery and low resilience to stress."

            "question": "In the context of personalized nutrition for burnout, why is Magnesium supplementation often prioritized for clients with high cortisol output?",
            "options": [
                "It directly increases blood glucose levels to provide energy",
                "It is a co-factor in over 300 enzymatic reactions and is 'wasted' by the kidneys during acute stress",
                "It acts as a stimulant to counteract the fatigue of the exhaustion stage",
                "It prevents the absorption of Vitamin C, which can be toxic in high doses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During periods of high stress, the body excretes magnesium at a higher rate (magnesium wasting). Magnesium is essential for modulating the HPA axis and relaxing the nervous system."

            "question": "The '3-2-1 Rule' for advanced sleep optimization suggests which of the following protocols before bed?",

                "3 hours before: stop eating; 2 hours before: stop working; 1 hour before: stop screens",
                "3 hours before: stop screens; 2 hours before: stop eating; 1 hour before: stop fluids",
                "3 hours before: stop exercise; 2 hours before: stop screens; 1 hour before: stop reading",
                "3 hours before: stop caffeine; 2 hours before: stop alcohol; 1 hour before: stop talking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 3-2-1 rule is a staple of sleep hygiene: 3 hours before bed for the last meal, 2 hours for ending work/cognitive stress, and 1 hour for eliminating blue light/screens."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, a client who presents with 'brain fog,' dissociation, and a feeling of being 'trapped' or 'frozen' is likely in which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Mobilization)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Immobilization/Shutdown)",
                "Hyper-frontality (Executive Function)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the most primitive survival response, characterized by immobilization, shutdown, and dissociation when the system perceives a life-threatening or overwhelming stressor."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Research into advanced mindfulness practices shows that long-term practitioners exhibit decreased activity in the 'Default Mode Network' (DMN). What is the practical result of this neurological change?",
            "options": [
                "Increased ability to multitask effectively",
                "Reduced self-referential rumination and 'mind-wandering'",
                "Permanent suppression of the amygdala's fear response",
                "Faster heart rate during meditation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DMN is associated with self-referential thought and rumination. Mindfulness training helps 'quiet' this network, allowing for greater present-moment awareness and less repetitive negative thinking."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "In Seligman's PERMA model of Positive Psychology, the 'E' stands for Engagement. How is this typically measured in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "The number of social events a client attends per week",
                "The client's ability to achieve a 'Flow' state where time seems to disappear",
                "The frequency of positive affirmations used in daily life",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Engagement refers to being fully absorbed in an activity, often described as 'Flow,' which is a key component of building psychological resilience and life satisfaction."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A coach notices a client is expressing persistent feelings of hopelessness, has stopped eating, and mentions that 'everyone would be better off without me.' What is the ethically required action?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the frequency of coaching sessions to provide more support",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize the 'Scope of Practice.' Suicidal ideation or signs of clinical depression require an immediate referral to a qualified clinical professional."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "When building a sustainable coaching practice, what is the primary benefit of a 'Value-Based Pricing' model over an hourly rate?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to charge more for the same amount of time",
                "It aligns the coach's compensation with the client's transformation rather than time spent",
                "It makes the coach's income more predictable month-to-month",
                "It reduces the need for marketing and lead generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the outcome and the 'cost of the problem' for the client, which decouples the coach's income from their hours, preventing coach burnout."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "The 'Window of Tolerance' concept in trauma-informed coaching suggests that when a client is 'Hyper-aroused,' they are:",
            "options": [
                "In a state of optimal learning and integration",
                "Experiencing emotional numbing and low energy",
                "In a state of agitation, anxiety, or fight-flight activation",
                "Ready to process deep-seated childhood trauma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal occurs when the nervous system is pushed above the window of tolerance, leading to sympathetic activation (anxiety, panic, or anger)."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Resonance Frequency Breathing (RFB) is an advanced biofeedback technique. What is the typical breath rate (breaths per minute) that maximizes Heart Rate Variability for most adults?",
            "options": [
                "12 - 15 breaths per minute",
                "8 - 10 breaths per minute",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical research shows that for most adults, breathing at a rate of approximately 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute (resonance frequency) maximizes Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia and HRV."
