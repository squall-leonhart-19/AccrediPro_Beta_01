            "question": "According to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) discussed in Lesson 1, which three dimensions must be present to clinically define burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Anxiety, Depression, and Physical Fatigue",
                "Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Reduced Personal Accomplishment",
                "Insomnia, Cognitive Decline, and Social Withdrawal",
                "High Cortisol, Low HRV, and Metabolic Dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MBI identifies the triad of burnout as emotional exhaustion (feeling drained), depersonalization (cynicism/detachment), and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment (ineffectiveness)."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is introduced as a key biomarker. A 2022 meta-analysis suggests that a consistently low RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) value typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal parasympathetic recovery",
                "High adaptive resilience",
                "Sympathetic dominance and poor stress recovery",
                "Balanced autonomic nervous system function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low RMSSD (a time-domain measurement of HRV) is a strong indicator of sympathetic dominance (fight-or-flight) and suggests the body is struggling to recover from stressors."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 details 'Coherent Breathing' as a method to achieve autonomic resonance. What is the specific breathing frequency recommended to maximize Vagal Tone?",
            "options": [
                "10 breaths per minute",
                "3 breaths per minute",

                "8.5 breaths per minute"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that breathing at a rate of approximately 5.5 to 6 breaths per minute (resonance frequency) optimizes the baroreflex and maximizes Heart Rate Variability."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Using the ABCDE model for Cognitive Restructuring (Lesson 4), if a client identifies a 'Belief' that they must be perfect to be valued, the 'Disputation' (D) phase involves:",
            "options": [
                "Accepting the belief as an absolute truth",
                "Challenging the evidence for the belief and seeking alternatives",

                "Describing the activating event in objective detail"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Disputation phase (D) is where the practitioner helps the client actively challenge the irrationality of the belief and generate more balanced, evidence-based perspectives."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights the 'Magnesium-Stress Cycle.' Why is Magnesium supplementation specifically recommended for burnout clients?",
            "options": [
                "It increases cortisol production to boost morning energy",
                "Stress causes magnesium excretion, and magnesium deficiency increases the stress response",
                "It is the primary fuel source for the brain during cognitive tasks",
                "It eliminates the need for aerobic exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress triggers the release of catecholamines and corticosteroids which cause magnesium to be excreted in urine; since magnesium is a natural NMDA antagonist, its depletion makes the nervous system more reactive to stress."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "In Values Clarification (Lesson 6), what is the fundamental difference between a 'Value' and a 'Goal'?",
            "options": [
                "Values are temporary; goals are permanent",
                "Goals are the 'why'; values are the 'how'",
                "Values are ongoing directions (like North); goals are specific destinations that can be checked off",
                "There is no functional difference in a coaching context"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Values are qualities of action that are never 'finished' (e.g., being a loving partner), whereas goals are specific, attainable outcomes (e.g., going on a date Friday night)."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Neuroplasticity' in stress management. Which mechanism explains how repetitive stress-reduction practices change the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Synaptic pruning of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) strengthening parasympathetic pathways",
                "Decreasing the size of the hippocampus",
                "Increasing the reactivity of the amygdala"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is the process by which repetitive activation of neural pathways (like those used in mindfulness or breathwork) strengthens the synaptic connections, making those states easier to access over time."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "During the 'Integration' phase of the RESTORE protocol (Lesson 8), a client in Stage 3 burnout (Adrenal Exhaustion) should prioritize which movement strategy?",
            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to 'shock' the system",
                "Heavy weightlifting to increase testosterone",
                "Zone 2 cardio for 60+ minutes daily",
                "Restorative movement like Tai Chi or gentle walking to avoid further HPA axis strain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In advanced burnout (Stage 3), the HPA axis is already compromised. High-intensity exercise can further deplete cortisol and worsen symptoms, making restorative movement the safest and most effective choice."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 2 describes 'Michael,' a 45-year-old executive with a 'flat' diurnal cortisol slope. This biological pattern is most closely associated with:",

                "Acute, short-term stress",
                "Chronic burnout and systemic inflammation",
                "Optimal health and high energy",
                "Excessive caffeine consumption only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'flat' diurnal slope (low morning cortisol and high/flat evening levels) is a hallmark of chronic HPA axis dysfunction seen in long-term burnout and is often correlated with systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "In the RESTORE protocol, what does the 'E' in the final stage of integration stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Eliminating all external stressors",
                "Empowering Long-Term Stress Management",
                "Evaluating Metabolic Markers",
                "Exhausting all cognitive options"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' stands for Empowering Long-Term Stress Management, focusing on the client's ability to maintain resilience and adapt the protocol to future challenges independently."
