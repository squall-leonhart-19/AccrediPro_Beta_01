            "question": "According to the lesson on Passive vs. Active Recovery, why is 'passive' rest (like watching television) often insufficient for burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It fails to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system and may maintain high-frequency beta brainwave activity.",
                "It increases metabolic rate too significantly to allow for cellular repair.",
                "It causes an immediate drop in blood glucose that triggers a cortisol spike.",
                "It prevents the lymphatic system from clearing metabolic waste from muscle tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Passive recovery often involves 'numbing' rather than 'restoring.' Activities like screen time keep the brain in beta-wave states and do not actively facilitate the 'rest and digest' response required to counteract chronic sympathetic dominance."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog,' inability to concentrate, and frequent mistakes in their work despite getting 8 hours of sleep. According to the 7 Types of Rest model, which deficit are they likely experiencing?",
            "options": [
                "Physical Rest",
                "Sensory Rest",
                "Mental Rest",
                "Spiritual Rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mental rest deficits manifest as cognitive fatigue, brain fog, and the inability to focus. This is distinct from physical exhaustion and requires 'brain dumps' or scheduled cognitive breaks to resolve."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "What is the primary biological mechanism by which morning sunlight exposure (within 30-60 minutes of waking) regulates the circadian clock?",
            "options": [
                "It triggers the immediate release of melatonin from the pineal gland.",
                "It stimulates melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells which signal the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN).",
                "It lowers the core body temperature to its daily minimum.",
                "It inhibits the production of Vitamin D3, signaling the body to wake up."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Morning light exposure is the primary zeitgeber (time-giver) for the SCN. This signal sets a biological timer for melatonin production to begin approximately 12-14 hours later."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "During which stage of the sleep architecture does the majority of physical repair, tissue growth, and Growth Hormone (GH) secretion occur?",
            "options": [
                "Stage N1 (Light Sleep)",
                "Stage N2 (Sleep Spindles)",
                "Stage N3 (Deep/Slow Wave Sleep)",
                "REM Sleep (Rapid Eye Movement)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "N3 or Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is the most physically restorative stage. While REM is crucial for emotional processing and memory, N3 is where the body focuses on physical recovery and immune function."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Digital 'dopamine loops' are reinforced by which psychological principle, making it difficult for burnout clients to disconnect?",
            "options": [
                "Fixed Interval Reinforcement",
                "Variable Ratio Reinforcement",

                "Classical Conditioning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infinite scrolls and notifications operate on variable ratio reinforcement (like a slot machine), providing unpredictable rewards that create a powerful neurological drive to continue the behavior."

            "question": "The 2019 'Nature Pill' study by Hunter et al. demonstrated that spending how much time in a natural setting was sufficient to significantly drop cortisol levels?",
            "options": [
                "5 minutes",
                "20 to 30 minutes",
                "Minimum of 90 minutes",
                "Exactly 4 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that a 'nature pill' of 20-30 minutes produced the greatest efficiency in lowering salivary cortisol levels, making it a highly effective volitional recovery protocol."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Which mineral is known as the 'anti-stress mineral' because it is rapidly depleted during the stress response and is essential for GABAergic signaling and muscle relaxation?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Sodium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is a critical cofactor in over 300 enzymatic reactions and is essential for downregulating the stress response. Chronic stress leads to increased magnesium excretion in urine."

            "question": "When designing a 'Recovery Sanctuary,' what is the scientifically recommended ambient temperature range for promoting optimal sleep depth and continuity?",
            "options": [
                "60°F - 67°F (15.5°C - 19.4°C)",
                "70°F - 75°F (21.1°C - 23.8°C)",
                "50°F - 55°F (10.0°C - 12.8°C)",
                "Temperature does not impact sleep architecture."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A cooler room helps facilitate the natural drop in core body temperature required for deep sleep. Temperatures above 70°F or below 60°F can lead to increased wakefulness and fragmented sleep."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A client feels 'socially burned out' but continues to say 'yes' to every invitation because they feel guilty. Which type of rest should a coach prioritize to address the root of this exhaustion?",
            "options": [
                "Creative Rest",
                "Social Rest",
                "Physical Rest",
                "Sensory Rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social rest involves the ability to be 'yourself' and requires surrounding oneself with life-giving people rather than life-draining ones, as well as the ability to set boundaries on social obligations."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the Glymphatic System, which becomes 10x more active during sleep?",
            "options": [
                "The synthesis of new muscle fibers.",
                "The removal of neurotoxic waste products, such as beta-amyloid, from the brain.",
                "The regulation of insulin sensitivity in the liver.",
                "The conversion of short-term memories into long-term storage in the prefrontal cortex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is the brain's waste clearance system. It functions primarily during sleep, specifically during deep sleep, by 'washing' the brain with cerebrospinal fluid to remove metabolic byproducts."
