            "options": [
                "Moving from a mindset of abundance to a mindset of scarcity",
                "Shifting from a reactive 'scarcity' mindset to a proactive 'abundance' mindset",
                "Increasing the volume of work to prove resilience",
                "Focusing exclusively on physical recovery while ignoring psychological growth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Optimization requires shifting from a scarcity mindset (focused on what is missing or threatening) to an abundance mindset (focused on growth, opportunities, and post-traumatic growth)."

            "question": "A 2017 meta-analysis indicated that what percentage of the Western population is estimated to be deficient in Magnesium, a mineral crucial for regulating the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "48-60%",
                "85-90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 48-60% of the population is deficient in magnesium, which is critical for modulating the stress response and preventing HPA axis hypersensitivity."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "For a client in the 'Optimize' phase of burnout recovery, why is Zone 2 (Low-Intensity Steady State) movement often preferred over High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)?",
            "options": [
                "HIIT does not burn enough calories for stress relief",
                "Zone 2 movement minimizes excessive cortisol spikes while still promoting BDNF and mitochondrial health",
                "HIIT is only effective for professional athletes",
                "Zone 2 movement is the only way to activate the sympathetic nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While HIIT is beneficial for some, it can trigger significant cortisol spikes that may overwhelm a recovering nervous system. Zone 2 movement provides the benefits of BDNF and mitochondrial biogenesis without the same hormonal tax."

            "question": "Which neurochemical is responsible for 'sleep pressure' that builds up during wakefulness and is directly inhibited by caffeine consumption?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin",
                "GABA",
                "Adenosine",
                "Dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adenosine builds up in the brain every hour we are awake, creating the drive to sleep. Caffeine molecules bind to adenosine receptors, masking the feeling of tiredness without removing the adenosine itself."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "According to the Eisenhower Matrix for time management, tasks that are 'Important but Not Urgent' (such as exercise, planning, and relationship building) should be:",
            "options": [
                "Done immediately to get them out of the way",
                "Scheduled for dedicated time blocks in the calendar",
                "Delegated to an assistant or family member",
                "Eliminated entirely to reduce the workload"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Important but Not Urgent tasks (Quadrant 2) are the keys to long-term optimization and burnout prevention. Because they lack an immediate deadline, they must be proactively scheduled."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "A study by the UCLA Center on Everyday Lives of Families (CELF) found a direct correlation between high salivary cortisol levels in women and which environmental factor?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of indoor plants",
                "The amount of blue light in the kitchen",
                "The density of household objects (clutter)",
                "The distance from their workplace"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The UCLA CELF study found that women who perceived their homes as 'cluttered' or full of 'unfinished projects' had higher levels of cortisol throughout the day compared to those with tidier environments."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In the 'Optimize' phase, why is 'Play' considered a neurobiological necessity rather than just a luxury?",
            "options": [
                "It helps people work faster the next day",
                "It promotes neuroplasticity, reduces the fear response, and fosters creative problem-solving",
                "It is the only way to increase heart rate variability (HRV)",
                "It ensures that the client remains competitive in the workplace"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Play stimulates the secretion of BDNF and promotes neuroplasticity. It allows the nervous system to practice 'safe' arousal, helping to recalibrate the stress response."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When building a 'Personalized Optimization Plan,' which strategy ensures the highest rate of long-term habit adherence?",
            "options": [
                "Implementing 10-12 changes simultaneously for a 'total life overhaul'",
                "Focusing on 'keystone habits' that create a positive ripple effect into other areas",
                "Setting vague goals like 'I want to feel better' to avoid pressure",
                "Restricting all leisure activities until all work tasks are completed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Keystone habits (like sleep or morning movement) often lead to the natural adoption of other healthy behaviors, making the overall optimization plan more sustainable and less overwhelming."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Why are high-glycemic index (GI) carbohydrates particularly problematic for a client struggling with burnout-related fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "They cause a rapid insulin spike followed by a 'crash' that triggers a compensatory cortisol release",
                "They prevent the body from absorbing any protein",
                "They increase the half-life of caffeine in the bloodstream",
                "They are impossible for the body to digest during the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-GI foods cause blood sugar spikes and subsequent crashes (hypoglycemia). The body perceives low blood sugar as a survival threat and releases cortisol to mobilize glucose, further taxing the HPA axis."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'revenge bedtime procrastination.' Which environmental optimization strategy is most likely to help break this cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Keeping the television on in the bedroom for background noise",
                "Implementing a 'Digital Sunset' by removing screens 60-90 minutes before bed",
                "Drinking a high-sugar snack to boost energy for evening chores",
                "Increasing the brightness of lights in the evening to stay alert"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Digital Sunset reduces blue light exposure (which suppresses melatonin) and removes the dopamine-driven stimulation of scrolling, making it easier for the brain to transition into sleep mode."
