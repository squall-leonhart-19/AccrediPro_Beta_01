            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the '70% Capacity Rule' for advanced goal setting suggests that to prevent burnout relapse, a client should cap their daily planned output at 70% of their perceived energy. What is the primary physiological rationale for this?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure they have 'buffer energy' to handle unexpected sympathetic nervous system spikes",
                "To maximize the rate of muscle glycogen replenishment",
                "To force the client to delegate at least 30% of their workload to others",
                "To reduce the total number of decisions made per day to under 50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 70% rule provides a 'safety margin' for the nervous system, ensuring that if an unexpected stressor occurs, the client has the physiological and cognitive resources to respond without entering a state of total depletion or 'crashing'."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Mastering Boundaries, what is 'Boundary Backlash' and how should a coach advise a client to handle it?",
            "options": [
                "The internal guilt a client feels after saying 'no', handled by self-flagellation",
                "The physiological 'hangover' from a difficult conversation, handled by 20 minutes of cardio",
                "The negative reaction or resistance from others when a client changes their behavior, handled by consistent reinforcement",
                "A legal challenge to a professional contract, handled by a mediator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boundary Backlash occurs when people accustomed to a client's lack of boundaries resist the new structure. The key intervention is consistency and 'holding the line' rather than retreating to old patterns."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Reframing, the 'Down-Arrow Technique' is used specifically to:",
            "options": [
                "Reduce the intensity of an emotional response through deep breathing",
                "Uncover the 'Core Belief' by repeatedly asking what a specific thought means about the client",
                "Shift the client's focus from the past to the future",
                "Identify the specific person in the client's life who is causing the most stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Down-Arrow Technique is a cognitive-behavioral tool that drills down through layers of automatic thoughts to reach the underlying schema or core belief (e.g., 'I am unworthy')."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory (Lesson 4), which state is characterized by 'immobilization with fear' and is often seen in late-stage burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",
                "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Collapse)",
                "Hyper-Vagal (Peak Performance)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the most primitive evolutionary response to perceived life-threat or inescapable stress, resulting in dissociation, exhaustion, and shutdown."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 cites a study on the Glymphatic system. What is the primary function of this system during deep sleep, and why is it critical for burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It pumps adrenaline out of the adrenal glands to reset the HPA axis",
                "It clears metabolic waste products, including amyloid-beta, from the brain",
                "It converts short-term memories into long-term skills",
                "It regulates the temperature of the internal organs to exactly 98.6°F"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is a waste clearance system for the CNS. Chronic stress impairs sleep, which prevents this 'brain washing,' leading to the 'brain fog' commonly reported in burnout."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In Advanced Nutrition for Burnout, which micronutrient is highlighted for its role in 'calming' the NMDA receptors and reducing glutamate-induced neurotoxicity during chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium (specifically Glycinate or Threonate)",
                "Iron",
                "Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker and regulates NMDA receptors. Stress causes magnesium depletion, which leads to neuronal hyperexcitability and anxiety."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "For a client with a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) score that is consistently 2 standard deviations below their baseline, which movement strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to 'shock' the system back to health",
                "Heavy weightlifting to increase testosterone and growth hormone",
                "Low-intensity zone 1 movement (walking, gentle stretching) or complete rest",
                "A 10km run to 'burn off' the excess cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A significantly low HRV indicates a nervous system that is already overtaxed. Adding high-intensity exercise (a 'hormetic' stressor) can push the client into further exhaustion or injury."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Case Study: A client reveals they have started using alcohol every night to 'numb out' and has expressed that they 'don't see the point in waking up tomorrow.' What is the ethical requirement for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the coaching frequency to three times per week",
                "Teach the client a more advanced Polyvagal grounding technique",
                "Immediately refer the client to a licensed mental health professional or crisis service",
                "Suggest a specific supplement to help with the alcohol cravings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation and substance abuse as a primary coping mechanism are 'Hard Red Flags' that fall outside the scope of coaching and require clinical intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "The 'Window of Tolerance' concept suggests that for coaching to be effective, the client must be:",
            "options": [
                "In a state of high sympathetic arousal to ensure they are motivated",
                "In a state of Dorsal Vagal shutdown to ensure they are compliant",
                "Within a range of arousal where they can process information and remain regulated",
                "Completely relaxed with no physiological arousal whatsoever"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the optimal zone of arousal where a person can function and integrate information effectively. If they are hyper-aroused or hypo-aroused, cognitive coaching techniques will likely fail."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, the 'Gut-Brain Axis' influences burnout recovery primarily through the production of which neurotransmitter in the enteric nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine (90% produced in the gut)",
                "Serotonin (approx. 90-95% produced in the gut)",
                "Cortisol (produced in the gut lining)",
                "Melatonin (produced exclusively in the gut)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The majority of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut. Chronic stress alters gut microbiota (dysbiosis), which can impair serotonin production and contribute to the mood disturbances seen in burnout."
