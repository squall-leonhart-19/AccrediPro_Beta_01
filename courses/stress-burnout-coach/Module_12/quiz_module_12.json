            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective characteristic of an 'Energized Goal' as discussed in the Advanced Goal Setting lesson?",
            "options": ["Vaguely defined and aspirational", "Focused solely on external validation", "Aligned with core values and intrinsic motivation", "Easily achievable within a short timeframe, regardless of personal meaning"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energized Goals derive their power from alignment with core values and intrinsic motivation, leading to sustained effort and reduced burnout risk. Goals focused on external validation or lacking personal meaning are less likely to provide lasting energy."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently agrees to extra work tasks despite feeling overwhelmed. Using advanced boundary setting techniques, what is the MOST effective initial step you should guide her to take?",
            "options": ["Immediately decline all additional requests to assert dominance.", "Reflect on her underlying fears and motivations behind saying 'yes'.", "Delegate all current tasks to colleagues to free up her time.", "Avoid communication with her supervisor to prevent further requests."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding the underlying reasons for boundary violations (e.g., fear of rejection, need for approval) is crucial before implementing practical boundary setting strategies. This self-reflection allows for a more sustainable and authentic approach to boundary setting."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which reframing technique is MOST effective in helping a client shift from a limiting belief of 'I'm not good enough' to a more empowering perspective?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the negative thought and focusing solely on positive affirmations.", "Challenging the evidence supporting the belief and exploring alternative interpretations.", "Accepting the belief as truth and learning to cope with the associated feelings.", "Replacing the belief with an unrealistic and overly positive statement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Challenging the evidence and exploring alternative interpretations addresses the root of the limiting belief by questioning its validity. This leads to a more sustainable and genuine shift in perspective compared to simply ignoring or replacing the belief."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which of the following physiological responses indicates activation of the ventral vagal pathway, promoting social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Increased heart rate and rapid breathing.", "Dilated pupils and muscle tension.", "A calm heart rate, relaxed facial muscles, and a gentle tone of voice.", "Fight or flight response, including increased blood pressure."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal pathway is associated with feelings of safety, connection, and social engagement. Physiological indicators include a calm heart rate, relaxed facial muscles, and a soothing tone of voice."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client reports chronic insomnia despite practicing basic sleep hygiene. Which advanced strategy would be MOST appropriate to suggest?",
            "options": ["Increasing caffeine intake in the morning to combat daytime fatigue.", "Implementing a strict sleep schedule, even on weekends, regardless of sleep quality.", "Exploring Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) techniques to address underlying thoughts and behaviors.", "Using alcohol as a sleep aid to promote relaxation before bed."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CBT-I is an evidence-based therapy that addresses the cognitive and behavioral factors contributing to insomnia. It's a more effective and sustainable approach than caffeine, rigid schedules (that may not be helpful), or alcohol, which disrupts sleep architecture."

            "options": ["Refined sugars and processed carbohydrates.", "Excessive saturated fats from animal products.", "Magnesium, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.", "Artificial sweeteners and food additives."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids are essential for supporting adrenal function, regulating neurotransmitters, and reducing inflammation, all crucial for burnout recovery. Refined sugars, saturated fats, and artificial additives can exacerbate stress and inflammation."

            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed daily.", "Prolonged periods of sitting with minimal movement.", "Slow, deliberate movements such as yoga, Tai Chi, or mindful walking.", "Competitive sports that trigger adrenaline release."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow, deliberate movements like yoga, Tai Chi, and mindful walking activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. HIIT and competitive sports can be beneficial but may also increase stress if not balanced with restorative practices."
