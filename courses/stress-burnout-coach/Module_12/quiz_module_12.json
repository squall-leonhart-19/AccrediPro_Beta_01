            "question": "When analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data from a client's wearable device, a high RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) score typically indicates which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Dominance of the sympathetic nervous system and high stress",
                "Strong vagal tone and efficient parasympathetic recovery",
                "A state of chronic systemic inflammation",
                "An impending cardiovascular event or arrhythmia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the primary time-domain measure used to assess the beat-to-beat variations mediated by the vagus nerve. A higher RMSSD reflects a healthy parasympathetic response and better resilience to stress."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neurofeedback, which brainwave frequency (typically 8–12 Hz) is targeted to help a burnout client achieve a state of 'relaxed alertness' and bridge the gap between the conscious and subconscious mind?",
            "options": [
                "Delta waves",
                "Theta waves",
                "Alpha waves",
                "Beta waves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha waves are associated with a state of wakeful relaxation. Increasing Alpha power through neurofeedback helps clients reduce 'mental chatter' and move out of the high-frequency Beta state associated with anxiety."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A 2015 study by Laukkanen et al. published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that frequent sauna use (4–7 times per week) was associated with a 50% reduction in cardiovascular-related mortality. What is the primary biological mechanism cited for this effect?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid weight loss through dehydration",
                "Activation of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and improved endothelial function",
                "Permanent lowering of the core body temperature",
                "Immediate elimination of heavy metals through sweat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sauna use acts as a 'hormetic stressor,' triggering the production of Heat Shock Proteins which repair damaged proteins and protect cells from future stress, while the heat improves blood flow and vascular health."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'air hunger,' chronic mouth breathing, and a 'Control Pause' (CP) of 12 seconds. Which breathwork protocol is most scientifically appropriate to increase their CO2 tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Wim Hof Method (Cyclic Hyperventilation)",
                "Holotropic Breathwork",
                "Buteyko Method",
                "Fire Breath (Kapalbhati)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Buteyko Method focuses on nasal breathing and breath reduction to normalize CO2 levels in the blood. A low Control Pause (under 20 seconds) indicates over-breathing, which Buteyko specifically addresses."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Regarding genetic markers for stress, a client with the 'Met/Met' variant of the COMT gene (often called the 'Worrier' genotype) typically exhibits which trait?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid breakdown of dopamine, leading to high resilience in high-pressure environments",
                "Slower breakdown of dopamine, leading to higher cognitive function but lower stress tolerance",
                "An inability to process Vitamin B12, leading to chronic fatigue",
                "A natural resistance to the effects of cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Met/Met variant results in 3-4 times lower COMT enzymatic activity. This leads to higher baseline dopamine levels, which aids complex tasks but makes the individual more susceptible to being overwhelmed by stress."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "The landmark 2011 study by Hölzel et al. used MRI scans to show that an 8-week MBSR program led to a measurable increase in gray-matter density in which brain region associated with emotional regulation and memory?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found increased gray-matter density in the hippocampus (learning/memory) and a decrease in the amygdala (fear/stress), providing structural evidence for the benefits of mindfulness."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "When utilizing Nootropics for burnout recovery, why is the combination of L-Theanine and Caffeine frequently recommended over Caffeine alone?",
            "options": [
                "L-Theanine doubles the half-life of caffeine in the bloodstream",
                "L-Theanine neutralizes the bitter taste of caffeine",
                "L-Theanine promotes Alpha brainwave activity, smoothing out the 'jitters' and vasoconstriction caused by caffeine",
                "The combination is required to bypass the blood-brain barrier"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-Theanine is an amino acid that promotes relaxation without sedation. When paired with caffeine, it reduces the side effects of over-stimulation while maintaining the focus-enhancing benefits."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "As a coach, how should you address a client experiencing 'Orthosomnia' related to their wearable technology?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend they buy a more expensive, medical-grade tracker",
                "Advise them to stop checking the data and instead focus on subjective feelings of restfulness",
                "Tell them to double their sleep supplement dosage until the data improves",
                "Ignore the data, as wearables are 100% inaccurate for sleep tracking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Orthosomnia is the preoccupation with achieving perfect sleep data. Coaches should help clients move away from data-obsession if the tracking itself is becoming a source of stress."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) supports recovery from chronic burnout primarily by which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Inducing a state of nitrogen narcosis for deep relaxation",
                "Using high pressure to force oxygen into the blood plasma, reducing neuroinflammation and supporting mitochondrial repair",
                "Decreasing the heart rate to below 40 beats per minute",
                "Increasing the production of carbon dioxide to trigger the Bohr effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under pressure, oxygen dissolves into all body fluids (plasma, CNS fluid, lymph). This hyper-oxygenation helps repair tissues that have been hypoxic due to chronic stress-induced vasoconstriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "In the 'Data-Information-Insight-Action' framework for coaching, which of the following represents an 'Insight'?",
            "options": [
                "The client's average Resting Heart Rate is 72 bpm.",
                "A line graph showing a downward trend in sleep quality over three weeks.",
                "The realization that the client's HRV drops significantly every Tuesday night after their late-shift meeting.",
                "The client deciding to move their meeting to Wednesday morning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insight is the 'why' behind the data. It connects the information (the graph) to a specific behavior or environmental factor, which then allows for targeted action."
