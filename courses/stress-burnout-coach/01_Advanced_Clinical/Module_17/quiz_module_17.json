            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a significant overlap of roughly 48-52%, highlighting the need for coaches to distinguish between burnout's context-specific exhaustion and depression's pervasive anhedonia."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is the 'low' state of the Window of Tolerance, where the parasympathetic nervous system causes the client to feel numb, disconnected, or physically immobilized."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
