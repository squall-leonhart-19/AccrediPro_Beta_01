            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "In the RESTORE Protocol, the 'S' stands for 'Systemic Integration.' What is the primary objective of this phase during the synthesis process?",
            "options": [
                "To isolate individual stressors and treat them sequentially",
                "To identify how biological, psychological, and social factors intersect to perpetuate the burnout cycle",
                "To focus exclusively on the sympathetic nervous system response",
                "To implement a standardized 30-day nutrition plan for all clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic Integration involves looking at the client as a whole, mapping the feedback loops between their physiology (e.g., HPA axis), psychology (e.g., limiting beliefs), and environment."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When applying the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to advanced assessment, which of the following best describes a 'Key Leverage Point'?",
            "options": [
                "The stressor that the client complains about most frequently",
                "A minor lifestyle change that requires the most effort to implement",
                "The 20% of root causes that are responsible for 80% of the client's symptomatic presentation",
                "The final symptom that appeared before the client reached out for coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leverage points are specific areas where a small intervention can produce significant systemic shifts. Identifying the 20% of causes that drive 80% of the burnout allows for more efficient and effective coaching."

        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Layered Stressors,' including a high-pressure job, a recent divorce, and chronic insomnia. According to Lesson 3, what is the recommended priority for intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate career coaching to reduce work hours",
                "Stabilizing the nervous system and physiological safety before deep cognitive restructuring",
                "Confronting the emotional trauma of the divorce immediately",
                "Prescribing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to boost endorphins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex presentations, stabilization is the priority. You cannot effectively process emotional trauma or cognitive shifts if the client's nervous system is in a state of constant dysregulation or 'survival mode.'"

        {
            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Nervous System Regulation, what does the 'Vagal Brake' refer to in the context of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)?",
            "options": [
                "The total cessation of all parasympathetic activity",
                "The mechanism by which the ventral vagus nerve slows the heart rate below the intrinsic pace of the SA node",
                "A pathological condition where the heart rate becomes dangerously low",
                "The use of breath-holding to induce a sympathetic surge"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Vagal Brake' is a Polyvagal Theory concept where the ventral vagal pathway regulates the heart's pacemaker. Strengthening this 'brake' improves the client's ability to transition between states of arousal and calm."

        {
            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "When using the 'Down-Arrow Technique' in advanced cognitive restructuring, what is the coach attempting to uncover?",
            "options": [
                "The client's lowest point of physical energy during the day",
                "A list of all negative events that happened in the past week",
                "The underlying core belief or 'schema' that fuels surface-level automatic thoughts",
                "The specific nutritional deficiencies causing brain fog"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Down-Arrow Technique is a cognitive-behavioral tool used to move from a specific thought (e.g., 'I missed a deadline') to the core belief (e.g., 'I am incompetent') that drives the stress response."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "According to research on personalized nutrition in Lesson 6, which micronutrient plays a critical role in modulating the HPA axis and is often depleted during chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Magnesium",
                "Sodium",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is often called the 'anti-stress mineral.' Chronic stress increases magnesium excretion, and deficiency can further sensitize the HPA axis, creating a vicious cycle of stress and depletion."

        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "A client in Stage 3 Burnout (Exhaustion) requests a high-intensity exercise program to 'get their energy back.' Based on the module, why might this be contraindicated?",
            "options": [
                "It will cause them to lose too much weight",
                "High-intensity exercise can further deplete cortisol levels and exacerbate HPA axis dysfunction in late-stage burnout",
                "Exercise has no impact on burnout recovery",
                "It will interfere with their sleep-wake cycle only if done in the morning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In late-stage burnout (hypocortisolism), the body lacks the cortisol reserves to handle the inflammatory stress of high-intensity exercise. Low-impact movement like restorative yoga or walking is often more appropriate for recovery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "The 'Valued Living Questionnaire' (VLQ) is used in Lesson 7 to help clients reclaim purpose. What is the distinction between 'Values' and 'Goals' in this framework?",
            "options": [
                "Values are temporary, while goals are permanent",
                "Goals are the destination; values are the 'compass' or directions used for the journey",
                "Values are only for personal life, while goals are for professional life",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Values are ongoing qualities of action (e.g., being a supportive friend), whereas goals are specific outcomes that can be achieved and checked off (e.g., calling a friend once a week)."

        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Abstinence Violation Effect' (AVE) in the context of relapse prevention?",
            "options": [
                "A physical withdrawal symptom from caffeine",
                "A cognitive distortion where a small 'slip' leads to a total abandonment of the recovery plan due to feelings of failure",
                "The positive feeling a client gets when they successfully avoid a stressor",
                "A legal term used in workplace burnout settlements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AVE occurs when a client views a minor lapse (e.g., skipping one meditation session) as a total failure, leading to a 'might as well give up' mentality. Coaches must teach clients to differentiate between a 'slip' and a 'relapse.'"

        {
            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis referenced in the module suggests that integrated stress management (combining physiological, cognitive, and lifestyle interventions) is ____ more effective than single-modality interventions.",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "25%",

                "95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that multi-modal, integrated approaches (like the RESTORE protocol) outperform single-modality approaches (like just exercise or just therapy) by 40-60% in long-term burnout recovery metrics."
