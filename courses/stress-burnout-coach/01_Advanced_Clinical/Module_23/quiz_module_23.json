            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Decentering (or cognitive defusion) allows clients to observe their thoughts objectively, reducing the emotional impact of the 'inner critic' often found in burnout."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To move out of a Dorsal Vagal (freeze) state, one must safely transition through a degree of sympathetic activation (mobilization) before reaching the Ventral Vagal (safety) state."
