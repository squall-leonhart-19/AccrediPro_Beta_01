            "options": [
                "Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Professional Efficacy",
                "Physical Fatigue, Cognitive Weariness, and Emotional Exhaustion",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MBI-GS measures Exhaustion (loss of energy), Cynicism (distanced attitude toward work), and Professional Efficacy (feelings of competence)."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In the context of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) assessment, what does a low RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "High parasympathetic activity and excellent recovery capacity",
                "Dominance of the sympathetic nervous system and reduced stress resilience",

                "Optimal balance between the enteric and central nervous systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD reflects parasympathetic (vagal) activity. Low RMSSD values are associated with high stress, poor recovery, and sympathetic dominance."

                "Burnout only involves physical symptoms, while MDD is purely psychological",
                "MDD symptoms are context-specific (work-related), while Burnout is pervasive across all life domains",
                "Burnout symptoms are often context-specific to work, while MDD is pervasive and transcends specific environments",
                "There is no measurable difference; they are considered the same condition in the ICD-11"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While they overlap, burnout is primarily context-bound (related to work/caregiving), whereas depression is pervasive across all areas of a client's life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On the PSS-10, scores from 0-13 are low stress, 14-26 are moderate, and 27-40 are considered high perceived stress."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Blunted Cortisol Awakening Response' (CAR). Based on Lesson 4, what does this physiological pattern most likely suggest?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A blunted CAR (lack of the typical 50-75% rise in cortisol 30 minutes after waking) is a hallmark of chronic stress and HPA-axis dysregulation in burnout."

            "options": [
                "It only measures physical exhaustion, ignoring cognitive factors",
                "It uses both positively and negatively worded items to cover the dimensions of Exhaustion and Disengagement",
                "It is designed specifically for medical doctors and excludes other professions",
                "It requires a blood sample to validate self-report findings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The OLBI covers Exhaustion and Disengagement using both positively and negatively phrased questions, which helps avoid response bias."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presenteeism is the act of showing up to work while ill or exhausted, resulting in a loss of productivity estimated to cost 2-3 times more than absenteeism."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize the limits of their scope. High scores on clinical scales like the DASS-21 depression subscale require referral to a mental health professional."
