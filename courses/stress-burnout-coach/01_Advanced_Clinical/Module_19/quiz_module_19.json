            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of chronic stress discussed in Lesson 1, which physiological phenomenon is most characteristic of advanced stage burnout?",
            "options": [
                "Acute hypercortisolemia with elevated morning peaks",
                "Hypocortisolism and a flattened Diurnal Cortisol Slope",
                "Increased parasympathetic tone during high-stress tasks",
                "Rapid downregulation of the Sympathomedullary (SAM) pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that while early stress causes high cortisol, chronic burnout often leads to hypocortisolism and a flattened diurnal slope, where the body fails to produce sufficient cortisol to meet daily demands."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-HSS), the gold standard for assessment, measures burnout across which three specific dimensions?",
            "options": [
                "Stress, Anxiety, and Depression",
                "Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Reduced Professional Efficacy",
                "Fatigue, Irritability, and Cognitive Dysfunction",
                "Work-Life Balance, Salary Satisfaction, and Peer Support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MBI validates burnout through the triad of Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization (Cynicism), and a sense of Reduced Personal Accomplishment (Professional Efficacy)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the RESTORE Protocol's 'Evaluate' phase (L3), why is Heart Rate Variability (HRV) utilized as a primary biometric marker?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the exact concentration of cortisol in the bloodstream",
                "It serves as a proxy for Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) flexibility and vagal tone",
                "It is the only metric that can diagnose clinical depression",
                "It provides a definitive measure of a client's IQ under pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is a well-researched indicator of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems; low HRV is consistently linked to burnout and poor stress resilience."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Research supporting the 'Stabilize' phase (L4) suggests that 'Vagus Nerve Stimulation' via slow-paced breathing (6 breaths per minute) achieves what specific outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Instant elimination of all systemic inflammation",
                "Activation of the HPA axis to increase alertness",
                "Increased baroreflex sensitivity and parasympathetic dominance",
                "A 50% increase in prefrontal cortex gray matter within 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow, rhythmic breathing at approximately 0.1 Hz (6 breaths/min) stimulates the vagus nerve, increasing baroreflex sensitivity and shifting the body into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 5 found that 'Cognitive Reframing' interventions for burnout yielded an average effect size (Cohen's d) of approximately 0.65. How is this interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "A small effect with negligible practical significance",
                "A medium-to-large effect indicating moderate-to-high practical significance",
                "A negative correlation suggesting the intervention was harmful",
                "A statistically insignificant result that should be ignored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In behavioral sciences, a Cohen's d of 0.65 is considered a medium-to-large effect size, suggesting that the 'Transform' phase interventions provide meaningful improvement for clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Reclaim & Empower' research (L6), what is the relationship between 'Self-Efficacy' and burnout recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Self-efficacy has no correlation with recovery",
                "Higher self-efficacy acts as a mediator that reduces the impact of job demands",
                "Self-efficacy only increases if the client changes their job entirely",
                "High self-efficacy is actually a predictor of faster burnout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bandura’s theory and subsequent burnout research show that self-efficacy—the belief in one's ability to succeed—is a critical psychological resource that buffers against stress and aids recovery."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When interpreting research data (L7), what does a '95% Confidence Interval (CI)' that does not cross the value of zero typically indicate for a mean difference?",
            "options": [
                "The study was conducted on fewer than 95 people",
                "The result is likely statistically significant at the p < .05 level",
                "The researchers are 100% certain the data is perfect",
                "The study should be discarded due to high variance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a 95% CI for a difference between groups does not include zero, it suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Which ethical principle (L8) is violated if a Stress & Burnout Coach attempts to treat a client's diagnosed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?",
            "options": [
                "Confidentiality",
                "Informed Consent",
                "Scope of Practice",
                "Fidelity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within their 'Scope of Practice.' Treating clinical mental health conditions like PTSD requires licensure as a therapist or psychologist."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In a case study from Lesson 2, a client presents with high 'Exhaustion' scores but low 'Cynicism' and high 'Professional Efficacy.' This profile is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "Full Burnout",
                "Disengaged",
                "Overextended",
                "Burnout-Resilient"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Overextended' profile is characterized by high exhaustion but maintains a connection to the work (low cynicism) and a sense of competence (high efficacy)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Why is the 'Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)' considered the gold standard in burnout intervention research?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is the least expensive way to conduct research",
                "Because it minimizes participant and researcher bias through allocation concealment",
                "Because it allows the coach to choose which clients get the best treatment",
                "Because it proves that stress is purely a psychological phenomenon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs, especially double-blind ones, are designed to eliminate bias and ensure that the observed effects are actually caused by the intervention rather than external factors or expectations."
