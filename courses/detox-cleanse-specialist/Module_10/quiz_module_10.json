            "options": [
                "Castor oil causes the gallbladder to dissolve rapidly, causing toxicity",
                "The pack may stimulate gallbladder contraction, potentially lodging a stone in the bile duct",
                "Castor oil reacts chemically with calcium stones to create heat",
                "There is no caution; castor oil packs are the primary cure for gallstones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because castor oil can stimulate smooth muscle contraction (via EP3 receptors), it may cause the gallbladder to contract, which is risky if large gallstones are present."
