            "question": "What is the primary physiological objective of sequencing the 'Drainage Pathways' before initiating Phase 2 (Liver/Gallbladder) of the P.U.R.I.F.Y. Protocol™?",
            "options": [
                "To accelerate weight loss through caloric restriction",
                "To prevent 'retox' by ensuring exit routes are open before mobilizing deep-tissue toxins",
                "To increase the metabolic rate of the thyroid gland",
                "To deplete glycogen stores in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Opening the 'bottom of the funnel' (colon and lymphatics) ensures that when the liver begins processing toxins in later phases, they have a clear path for elimination, preventing re-absorption or a Herxheimer reaction."

            "question": "According to the 7-Day Blueprint, what is the lymphatic system's daily fluid turnover rate, and why does it require manual stimulation?",
            "options": [
                "15-20 liters; it relies on the heart as a pump",
                "0.5 liters; it is a closed loop system",
                "2-4 liters; it lacks a central pump and relies on movement and breath",
                "8-10 liters; it is stimulated exclusively by hydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lymphatic system moves roughly 2-4 liters of lymph daily but lacks a pump like the heart, necessitating movement, dry brushing, and deep breathing to prevent stagnation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol recommends a baseline of half an ounce of water per pound of body weight (80 oz for 160lb) to facilitate lymphatic flow and soften colonic waste."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data indicates that a 1.5L increase in water intake can improve colonic transit time by approximately 38%, highlighting the importance of hydration in the preparation phase."

                "From the chest outward toward the hands and feet",
                "In circular motions around the abdomen only",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dry brushing must follow the direction of lymphatic flow, which moves toward the lymph nodes and eventually the subclavian veins near the heart."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Types 3 and 4 are considered the 'Gold Standard' for elimination. Moving to Phase 2 with Type 1 or 2 (constipation) significantly increases the risk of toxicity symptoms."

                "Immediately begin Phase 2 liver flushes to force elimination",
                "Pause the 7-day timeline and implement magnesium citrate or 'smooth move' tea until daily elimination resumes",
                "Switch to a juice-only fast for the remaining 2 days",
                "Continue as planned; the liver phase will naturally fix the constipation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol mandates daily elimination before moving forward. If the colon is blocked, the practitioner must intervene with natural laxatives or increased fiber/water before proceeding."

            "options": [
                "To increase oxygen levels for fat burning",
                "To create a pressure vacuum in the thoracic duct, pulling lymph upward",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep breathing creates a pressure differential in the thoracic duct (the largest lymphatic vessel), acting as a 'respiratory pump' for lymphatic fluid."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Binders are non-selective and can bind to beneficial nutrients, supplements, or medications. They must be spaced at least 2 hours apart from other substances."
