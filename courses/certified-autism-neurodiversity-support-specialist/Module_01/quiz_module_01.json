            "question": "Which of the following best describes the core shift from the Medical Model to the Neurodiversity Paradigm as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from a focus on 'fixing' deficits to recognizing neurological differences as natural human variations.",
                "Prioritizing pharmacological interventions over behavioral therapies.",
                "Redefining autism as a purely psychological condition rather than a biological one.",
                "Eliminating the use of clinical diagnoses in favor of self-identification exclusively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Neurodiversity Paradigm views autism and other neurodivergent conditions as natural variations in the human genome rather than inherent 'defects' or 'disorders' that require a cure."

            "question": "According to the neurobiological research cited in Lesson 2 (e.g., Tang et al., 2014), what is a primary characteristic of brain architecture in many autistic individuals?",
            "options": [
                "A significant reduction in total brain volume by age 5.",
                "Accelerated synaptic pruning leading to fewer neural connections.",
                "Reduced synaptic pruning resulting in an overabundance of local connections and 'hyper-connectivity'.",
                "Complete absence of the corpus callosum in 45% of cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that many autistic brains experience reduced synaptic pruning during early development, leading to an overabundance of synapses and high local connectivity, which can contribute to sensory sensitivity."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client frequently bumps into furniture, uses excessive force when closing doors, and seeks out 'heavy work' like carrying weighted bags. Which sensory system is likely being under-responsive?",
            "options": [
                "Vestibular system",
                "Interoceptive system",
                "Proprioceptive system",
                "Olfactory system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The proprioceptive system processes input from muscles and joints regarding body position and force. Seeking deep pressure or 'heavy work' is a common strategy to regulate an under-responsive proprioceptive system."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the context of Monotropism (Lesson 4), how does an 'attention tunnel' impact an autistic individual's executive function?",
            "options": [
                "It enhances the ability to multitask and switch between diverse stimuli rapidly.",
                "It causes hyper-focus on a single interest, making transitions and task-switching highly effortful and energy-consuming.",
                "It prevents the individual from ever reaching a 'flow state'.",
                "It results in a total lack of interest in sensory stimuli outside of the tunnel."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monotropism suggests that autistic attention is often funneled into a few highly focused 'tunnels'. While this allows for deep expertise, it makes shifting attention to outside stimuli (executive function) very taxing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt Language Processors (GLPs) learn language in whole chunks or 'gestalts' (scripts/echolalia) rather than starting with single words and building up to sentences."

            "id": "q1_6",

            "options": [
                "A localized deficit in the autistic person's 'Theory of Mind'.",
                "A lack of empathy inherent in the neurotypical population.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication issues are a 'two-way street' where both parties struggle to understand the other's perspective due to different neuro-types, rather than a one-sided deficit."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Lever & Geurts, 2016) suggests that 70-80% of autistic individuals meet the criteria for at least one co-occurring condition, highlighting the need for comprehensive support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosis is a clinical act reserved for licensed psychologists or medical doctors. Support Specialists provide intervention, advocacy, and implementation, but do not issue formal diagnoses."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is demonstrating hyper-reactivity (over-sensitivity) to sound and is engaging in 'avoiding' behaviors (covering ears, seeking quiet) to regulate her sensory input."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Difficulty recognizing internal cues like hunger, thirst, or the need to use the bathroom is a hallmark of interoceptive processing differences."
