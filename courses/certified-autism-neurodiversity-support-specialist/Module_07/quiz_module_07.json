            "question": "According to the Executive Functioning profiling in Lesson 1, what is the primary distinction between 'Task Initiation' and 'Autistic Inertia'?",
            "options": [
                "Task initiation is a lack of motivation, while inertia is a physical inability to move.",
                "Autistic inertia involves significant difficulty both starting a new task and stopping a current one due to 'monotropism'.",
                "Task initiation only applies to work settings, while inertia applies to personal hygiene.",
                "There is no distinction; they are clinical synonyms for the same neurological deficit."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic inertia is characterized by a 'resistance to change in state,' meaning the individual struggles to transition into a task (start) and out of a task (stop) once they have achieved hyper-focus."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "The CAT-Q (Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire) identifies three distinct subscales. Which of these refers to 'using alternative strategies to solve problems in social situations'?",
            "options": [
                "Masking",
                "Assimilation",
                "Compensation",
                "Internalization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compensation involves finding ways around difficulties within social situations, such as copying body language or learning social scripts from movies."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the concept of 'Interoception' is discussed. How does poor interoceptive awareness typically manifest in L1 autistic adults?",
            "options": [
                "An inability to recognize external sensory triggers like bright lights.",
                "Difficulty identifying internal states such as hunger, thirst, or the early physical signs of anxiety.",
                "A hypersensitivity to the texture of clothing against the skin.",
                "The tendency to experience 'synesthesia' where sounds are perceived as colors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Poor interoception often leads to missing the early warning signs of distress or physiological needs until they reach a crisis point."

            "options": [
                "A desire to manipulate others for personal gain.",
                "A lack of moral development or understanding of rules.",
                "An anxiety-driven need for autonomy and the perception of demands as threats to safety.",
                "A neurological inability to understand verbal instructions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PDA is increasingly understood as a 'Pervasive Drive for Autonomy' where the individual's nervous system perceives a loss of control as a survival threat, leading to avoidant behaviors."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A 2021 study cited in Lesson 4 regarding Autistic Burnout found that which of the following is a primary contributor to the condition?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of physical exercise and poor diet.",
                "The cumulative load of camouflaging and meeting neurotypical expectations.",
                "Excessive participation in special interests.",
                "High intelligence levels (IQ > 130)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic burnout is frequently caused by the chronic exhaustion of 'masking' or camouflaging one's true self to fit into neurotypical environments without adequate support or downtime."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In the context of Employment Navigation (Lesson 5), what does the 'Disclosure Decision Matrix' suggest is the safest first step for a client seeking workplace accommodations?",
            "options": [
                "Full disclosure of the Autism diagnosis to the entire team immediately.",
                "Functional disclosure, which focuses on specific needs (e.g., 'I work best in quiet environments') rather than the diagnostic label.",
                "Withholding all information until a performance review is failed.",
                "Filing a formal legal complaint with the HR department before starting the job."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional disclosure allows a client to secure necessary accommodations (like noise-canceling headphones or written instructions) without the risk of stigma associated with a label."

                "There is a bidirectional mismatch in communication styles and experiences between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals.",
                "Social communication is an innate skill that cannot be learned."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that autistic people empathize well with other autistic people, and neurotypicals with neurotypicals, but the 'gap' exists between the two different neurological styles."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, 'Parallel Play' (or 'Body Doubling') is recommended as a strategy for romantic intimacy. How is this defined?",
            "options": [
                "Engaging in the exact same hobby at the exact same time.",
                "Being in the same space as a partner while working on separate activities without the pressure for constant social interaction.",
                "A form of therapy where partners role-play social scenarios.",
                "Ensuring that both partners have identical schedules."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel play allows for 'low-demand' connection, where partners enjoy each other's presence while maintaining their own 'monotropic' focus on individual tasks."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Independent Living, why might an L1 autistic adult with a high IQ still struggle with 'Activities of Daily Living' (ADLs)?",
            "options": [
                "Due to 'Executive Functioning Fragmentation' where the cognitive load of multi-step tasks (like cooking) exceeds processing capacity.",
                "Because they are choosing to be lazy or uncooperative.",
                "Because IQ is the only reliable predictor of independent living success.",
                "Due to a lack of basic motor skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High cognitive ability (IQ) does not equate to high executive functioning. The 'sequencing' required for ADLs can be overwhelming for those with significant EF challenges."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Internalized Distress'—they appear calm and compliant in public but have explosive meltdowns at home. This is often referred to in Lesson 3 as:",
            "options": [
                "The 'Coke Bottle Effect' (shaking up stress throughout the day until it explodes in private).",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Coke Bottle Effect' describes how many L1 autistic individuals suppress their sensory and emotional distress in public (masking), leading to a delayed release once they reach a 'safe' environment."
