            "question": "Research into the neurobiological foundations of autism indicates a specific pattern of neural connectivity. Which of the following best describes this pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Uniform global hyper-connectivity across all brain regions.",
                "Local hyper-connectivity (over-functioning in specific clusters) and long-range hypo-connectivity (reduced communication between distant regions).",
                "A total lack of pruning in the prefrontal cortex resulting in 50% more neurons in all adults.",
                "Hypo-connectivity in the amygdala specifically, leading to a lack of emotional response to stimuli."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, such as those by Courchesne et al., suggest that the autistic brain often exhibits 'local hyper-connectivity' (contributing to detail-focus) and 'long-range hypo-connectivity' (making it harder to integrate information across different brain areas)."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the Monotropism theory (Murray et al., 2005), what is the primary cognitive difference in autistic individuals?",
            "options": [
                "A total inability to focus on any single task for more than five minutes.",
                "An 'attention tunnel' where cognitive energy is concentrated on a small number of interests, making transitions difficult.",
                "A deficit in the ability to process visual information compared to auditory information.",
                "The inability to use 'top-down' processing in any social situation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monotropism posits that autistic minds tend to focus intensely on a narrow range of interests (attention tunnels). This concentration of cognitive resources makes it difficult to switch tasks when the 'tunnel' is interrupted."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In the Eight-Sense Model of sensory processing, which sense is responsible for internal body signals like hunger, thirst, heart rate, and the need to use the restroom?",
            "options": [
                "Proprioception",
                "Vestibular",
                "Interoception",
                "Tactile Integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the 'eighth sense' that allows us to feel and interpret internal bodily states. Difficulties with interoception can lead to challenges in emotional regulation and physical self-care."

            "options": [
                "Autistic people lack the neurological hardware for empathy (Theory of Mind deficit).",
                "Non-autistic people are naturally superior communicators who must teach autistic people how to interact.",
                "Communication is a bidirectional process, and there is a mutual mismatch in experiences and signals between autistic and non-autistic people.",
                "Autistic people prefer to be alone and therefore choose not to use their empathy skills."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem argues that communication difficulties are a 'two-way street' caused by differing life experiences and communication styles between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals, rather than a deficit residing solely in the autistic person."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "What does the research suggest about the function of 'stimming' (Self-Stimulatory Behavior)?",
            "options": [
                "It is a purposeless behavior that should be extinguished to help the client fit in.",
                "It is strictly a sign of distress and should only be addressed when the client is crying.",
                "It serves as a vital tool for sensory regulation, emotional expression, and reducing cognitive load.",
                "It is a learned behavior used primarily to manipulate social outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimming is functional; it helps autistic individuals regulate their nervous systems, process intense sensory input, and express joy or anxiety."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a statistically significant risk associated with high levels of 'Masking' or 'Camouflaging' (as measured by the CAT-Q)?",
            "options": [
                "Improved long-term career satisfaction due to better social integration.",
                "A 20% increase in verbal IQ scores over time.",
                "Significantly higher rates of exhaustion, burnout, and suicidal ideation.",
                "A complete reversal of autistic traits by age 30."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Cassidy et al., 2018) shows that masking is associated with severe mental health challenges, including burnout and a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideation due to the intense effort required to hide one's true self."

            "question": "When considering Differential Diagnosis, how might a practitioner distinguish between Autism and Social Anxiety Disorder?",
            "options": [
                "Autistic people never feel anxious in social situations, whereas people with Social Anxiety always do.",
                "In Autism, social challenges are present even when the person is comfortable; in Social Anxiety, the challenges stem primarily from the fear of negative evaluation.",
                "Social Anxiety can be cured with medication, while Autism cannot be supported at all.",
                "There is no difference; they are the same condition under different names."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While they often co-occur, the root of Autism is a difference in social-communication processing that exists regardless of anxiety levels, whereas Social Anxiety is driven specifically by the fear of being judged or rejected."

                "The sudden increase in sensory sensitivity that occurs during puberty.",

                "The physical danger of elopement in early childhood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Cliff Edge' refers to the transition at age 18 or 21 where individuals lose access to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates and struggle to find adult-oriented support services."

            "options": [
                "Excel at seeing the 'big picture' but struggle with specific details.",
                "Notice a tiny typo on a menu but struggle to summarize the overall theme of the restaurant.",
                "Have no memory of past events (episodic memory deficit).",
                "Prefer loud, crowded environments over quiet ones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weak Central Coherence (WCC) theory suggests a bias toward local processing (details) over global processing (the 'big picture' or 'gist')."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "In a case study, 'Sarah' (age 28) reports feeling 'completely drained' after work, requiring two hours in a dark room to recover. She performs well at her job but feels she is 'acting' a role all day. What is the most likely clinical explanation?",
            "options": [
                "She has a primary sleep disorder unrelated to neurodiversity.",
                "She is experiencing the 'cost of masking' and potential autistic burnout.",
                "She is simply introverted and needs more coffee.",
                "She has a lack of professional motivation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's description of 'acting' a role and needing sensory deprivation (the dark room) to recover from the workday is a classic presentation of masking and the resulting exhaustion/burnout common in autistic adults."
