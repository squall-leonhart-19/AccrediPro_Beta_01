        <h2 id="cliff">1. The 'Service Cliff': A Structural Crisis</h2>
        <p>For many Level 1 (L1) autistic individuals, the transition from secondary school to adulthood is not a gradual slope, but a jagged drop-off often referred to as the <span class="highlight">Service Cliff</span>. In the K-12 system, support is governed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which mandates that schools identify and provide services to ensure student success. This is an "entitlement-based" system.</p>

        <p>However, upon graduation or reaching age 21/22, this mandate disappears. The individual moves into an "eligibility-based" system where the burden of proof, self-advocacy, and navigation shifts entirely to the neurodivergent person. For those with L1 support needs—whose challenges are often "invisible"—this transition is particularly treacherous because they are frequently deemed "too functional" for adult developmental services but "not functional enough" to navigate the complexities of independent living and professional life without scaffolding.</p>

        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <span class="stat-value">66%</span>
            <span class="stat-desc">Of autistic young adults do not have a job or plans for further education within two years of leaving high school (Roux et al., 2015).</span>
        </div>

        <h2 id="higher-ed">2. Higher Education: Moving Beyond "Extra Time"</h2>
        <p>In Higher Education, the primary legal frameworks are Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Unlike high school, colleges are not required to modify their curriculum; they are only required to provide <span class="highlight">access</span> through reasonable accommodations.</p>

        <p>While most Disability Service Offices (DSOs) are well-versed in "standard" accommodations—such as extended time on exams or quiet testing rooms—these rarely address the core challenges of the L1 profile: <span class="highlight">Executive Functioning (EF)</span> and social integration. A student may have 2.0x time on a test, but if they cannot manage the executive demand of breaking down a 15-page research paper over six weeks, the extra hour in the testing center is irrelevant.</p>

        <h2 id="employment">3. Employment Barriers: The Interview Paradox</h2>
        <p>The L1 population faces a unique "Employment Paradox." Many possess high-level technical skills, deep focus (Monotropism), and exceptional attention to detail, yet they remain one of the most underemployed demographics globally. A 2020 report by Deloitte indicated that approximately <span class="highlight">85% of autistic adults with a college degree</span> are unemployed or underemployed.</p>

        <p>The barrier is rarely job competency; it is the <span class="highlight">Social Curriculum</span> of the workplace. This begins with the interview—a social performance ritual that tests "cultural fit," eye contact, and the ability to "read between the lines," rather than the ability to perform the job duties. Once hired, the "Hidden Curriculum" of the office (office politics, unwritten rules of communication, and sensory-overwhelming open-plan offices) often leads to burnout and high turnover.</p>

        <div class="case-study">
            <div class="case-header">Case Study: The "Performance" Barrier</div>
            <p><strong>Client:</strong> Marcus (24), Software Developer, L1 Autism.</p>
            <p><strong>Presenting Issue:</strong> Marcus applied for 40+ positions. He passed every technical coding assessment in the top 5th percentile but never received a job offer after the "behavioral" interview rounds.</p>
            <p><strong>Intervention:</strong> Working with a Support Specialist, Marcus identified that his literal communication was being interpreted as "arrogance" or "lack of teamwork." The specialist helped Marcus develop a <em>Disclosure Script</em> for the start of interviews.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Marcus disclosed his neurodivergence at the start of his next interview, explaining: "I process social cues differently, so if I seem overly direct, it's my focus on accuracy." He was hired by a firm that valued his transparency and technical prowess.</p>

        <h2 id="disclosure">4. Strategic Disclosure and Legal Rights</h2>
        <p>Disclosure is not an all-or-nothing event; it is a strategic process. Under the ADA, an employee is only required to disclose their disability if they are requesting a "Reasonable Accommodation."</p>

        <h3>The Disclosure Framework:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> To obtain legal protection, access accommodations, or reduce the cognitive load of <span class="highlight">Masking</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>When:</strong> Options include during the application (rarely advised for L1), after the offer is made, or after a performance issue arises.</li>
            <li><strong>How:</strong> Focus on "Needs and Solutions" rather than "Deficits." Instead of "I have autism," try "I have a sensory processing style that makes open-plan offices difficult; I am 30% more productive in a quiet space or with noise-canceling headphones."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="coaching">5. The Role of Job Coaching and Vocational Rehab</h2>
        <p>Support Specialists play a critical role in bridging the gap between clinical support and vocational success. This involves <span class="highlight">Job Coaching</span>, which differs from traditional therapy by focusing on the environmental and task-specific demands of the workplace.</p>

        <p><strong>Vocational Rehabilitation (VR)</strong> is a government-funded resource in many countries (such as the state-level VR agencies in the US) that provides funding for job coaching, assistive technology, and specialized training. However, VR systems are often bureaucratic. The Support Specialist acts as the "Systems Navigator," helping the client translate their needs into the language of the VR agency.</p>

        <h3>Key Specialist Strategies:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Environmental Audits:</strong> Assessing the workplace for sensory triggers (fluorescent lights, high-traffic areas).</li>
            <li><strong>Task Analysis:</strong> Breaking down complex professional projects into executive-friendly steps.</li>
            <li><strong>The Double Empathy Bridge:</strong> Educating managers on how to give clear, written instructions rather than vague verbal feedback.</li>
        </ol>

            <div class="case-header">Case Study: Navigating the Hidden Curriculum</div>
            <p><strong>Client:</strong> Sarah (31), Library Assistant, L1 Autism.</p>
            <p><strong>Presenting Issue:</strong> Sarah received a "poor performance" review because she "ignored" colleagues in the breakroom, leading to a perception that she was "not a team player."</p>
            <p><strong>Intervention:</strong> The Support Specialist facilitated a meeting with Sarah’s manager. They explained Sarah’s <em>Interoceptive Awareness</em> needs (Lesson 3.4)—she needed the breakroom time to decompress from sensory overload to prevent burnout.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Sarah was granted a "Reasonable Adjustment" to take her breaks in a private study room. Her manager sent a memo to the team clarifying Sarah’s need for quiet time, which removed the social stigma.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>1. Why is the transition to higher education often more difficult for L1 students than high school, even if they have high IQs?</p>
                <button class="reveal-btn" onclick="this.nextElementSibling.style.display='block'">Reveal Answer</button>
                <div class="answer">
                    The shift from an "entitlement" system (IDEA) to an "eligibility" system (ADA) requires the student to self-advocate and manage executive functioning demands without the proactive scaffolding provided in K-12.

            <div class="question" style="margin-top:20px;">
                <p>2. What is the "Double Empathy Problem" in the context of a job interview?</p>
                <button class="reveal-btn" onclick="this.nextElementSibling.style.display='block'">Reveal Answer</button>
                <div class="answer">
                    The interviewer (often neurotypical) may misinterpret the autistic candidate's lack of eye contact or literal speech as a lack of interest or social skill, while the candidate is simply communicating in a way that is natural to their neurotype.
