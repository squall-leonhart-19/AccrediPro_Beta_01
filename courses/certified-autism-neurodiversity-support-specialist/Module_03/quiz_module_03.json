            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Invisible Disability' paradox in Level 1 Autism?",
            "options": [
                "The individual has no support needs in social settings.",
                "The lack of obvious physical markers leads to an underestimation of the internal cognitive load and exhaustion required to function.",
                "The individual is able to fully recover from autistic traits through behavioral intervention.",
                "Support needs are only present during childhood and dissipate in adulthood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Level 1 is often termed 'invisible' because the individual may appear to function well superficially, while experiencing significant internal cognitive load, sensory overwhelm, and exhaustion."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to Damian Milton's 'Double Empathy Problem,' where does the primary breakdown in communication lie?",
            "options": [
                "Solely within the autistic individual's lack of social skills.",
                "In the neurotypical individual's inability to process sensory information.",
                "In the bidirectional mismatch of experiences and expectations between neurodivergent and neurotypical people.",
                "In the neurological inability of autistic individuals to feel empathy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication issues are a two-way street caused by a gap in understanding between two different neurological experiences, rather than a deficit in just one person."

            "question": "A client struggles with 'Autistic Inertia.' Which executive functioning challenge does this specifically relate to?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autistic Inertia refers to the difficulty in starting a task (initiation) or stopping/changing a task (transitioning), which is a core executive functioning challenge."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Which sensory system is responsible for 'Interoception,' and how does it commonly manifest in Level 1 profiles?",
            "options": [
                "The 8th sense; it involves internal body signals like hunger, thirst, and heart rate, often leading to delayed recognition of physical needs.",
                "The vestibular sense; it involves balance and spatial orientation, leading to frequent falls.",
                "The proprioceptive sense; it involves the awareness of limb position in space.",
                "The tactile sense; it involves hypersensitivity to clothing textures."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the internal sensory system. Many Level 1 individuals have poor interoceptive awareness, meaning they may not realize they are hungry, thirsty, or stressed until they reach a point of meltdown."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "The CAT-Q (Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire) measures three subscales. Which of these refers to the use of 'scripts' or rehearsed behaviors to mimic neurotypical interaction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compensation involves using 'workarounds' or scripts to navigate social situations that do not come naturally, such as practicing facial expressions or pre-planning conversations."

            "options": [
                "Depression involves a loss of interest, whereas Burnout involves a loss of functional skills and increased sensory sensitivity.",
                "Burnout only occurs in children, while depression only occurs in adults.",
                "Depression requires medication, while Burnout requires more social interaction.",
                "There is no clinical difference; they are synonymous in neurodivergent populations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While they overlap, Autistic Burnout is specifically characterized by the loss of previously mastered skills (e.g., executive function) and a significant decrease in sensory tolerance due to chronic over-exertion."

            "options": [
                "Masking increases the likelihood of finding long-term employment by 80%.",
                "Masking is positively correlated with higher self-esteem in social settings.",
                "Autistic adults who mask more frequently are at a significantly higher risk for suicidal ideation and exhaustion.",
                "Masking is a healthy coping mechanism that should be encouraged in all clinical settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that the effort of camouflaging/masking is a major risk factor for mental health crises and suicidal ideation due to the resulting lack of identity and extreme exhaustion."

                "A specific type of sensory overload caused by campus architecture."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Cliff Effect' describes the loss of the legal entitlements to support (like those in an IEP) once a student enters the adult world/higher education, where they must self-advocate to receive accommodations."

                "Giving the employee a performance review every day.",
                "Providing noise-canceling headphones and a desk in a low-traffic area.",
                "Requiring the employee to attend more social 'team-building' happy hours.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental modifications focus on the physical or structural surroundings to reduce sensory input and cognitive load, such as controlling noise and traffic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autistic individuals often use bottom-up processing, meaning they take in every detail of information first. This can lead to expertise in specific areas but can also cause 'detail-overwhelm' when trying to find the main point."
