            "question": "In the context of Advanced Clinical Reasoning, why is a 'transdiagnostic' approach considered superior to traditional categorical labeling for neurodivergent populations?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for any formal diagnosis or medical records.",
                "It focuses on the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory processing and executive function, which often overlap across multiple diagnostic categories.",
                "It allows practitioners to bill insurance using a single, universal code for all neurodevelopmental conditions.",
                "It prioritizes behavioral modification over physiological regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transdiagnostic reasoning looks beyond the 'label' (e.g., Autism vs. ADHD) to address the shared underlying neuro-physiological traits, leading to more precise and individualized interventions."

        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory application, a neurodivergent client who appears 'shut down,' avoids eye contact, and has a low heart rate variability is likely experiencing which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Ventral Vagal Stabilization",
                "Sympathetic Hyper-arousal",
                "Dorsal Vagal Immobilization",
                "Social Engagement System Activation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the oldest evolutionary response, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, or 'shutdown' when the nervous system perceives a life-threatening lack of safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When engaging in systemic advocacy (Macro-Level Influence), which of the following best describes the 'Social Model of Disability' perspective?",
            "options": [
                "Disability is a medical deficit that must be cured through intensive therapy.",
                "Disability is primarily a result of the individual's inability to adapt to standard social norms.",
                "Disability is a result of the interaction between an individual's impairment and an unaccommodating environment.",
                "Disability is a private family matter that should be managed without state intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Social Model posits that systemic barriers, derogatory attitudes, and social exclusion are the main contributory factors in 'disabling' people, rather than their inherent neurobiology."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "In Clinical Supervision, the 'Parallel Process' is a critical concept for Master Practitioners to monitor. What does this term refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The phenomenon where the dynamics of the practitioner-client relationship are mirrored in the supervisor-practitioner relationship.",
                "The requirement to treat two clients with similar diagnoses using the exact same protocol.",
                "The simultaneous development of motor and cognitive skills in neurodivergent children.",
                "A scheduling technique where two practitioners see the same client at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when a supervisee unconsciously recreates the client's struggles or relational patterns within the supervision session, providing a valuable diagnostic window."

                "Winning the argument by presenting more data than the opposing side.",
                "Uncovering the underlying needs and fears of all parties rather than sticking to 'fixed positions'.",
                "Compromising exactly 50/50 so that neither party gets what they actually wanted."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interest-based negotiation seeks 'win-win' outcomes by identifying why a party wants something (the interest) rather than just what they say they want (the position)."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A 2022 study on program design found that neurodivergent outcomes improved by 34% when 'Co-production' was utilized. What does 'Co-production' entail?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Avoiding all advocacy work to remain 'neutral' in the eyes of the public."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical leadership involves the judicious use of self-disclosure, ensuring it is client-centered rather than practitioner-centered."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Practitioner sustainability is often threatened by 'Moral Injury.' This is specifically defined as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moral injury occurs when practitioners know the 'right' way to support a client but are prevented from doing so by insurance rules, school policies, or systemic failures."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "When measuring evidence-based outcomes, 'Goal Attainment Scaling' (GAS) is particularly effective for neurodivergent clients because:",
            "options": [
                "It uses a standardized 0-100 scale that compares the client to 'neurotypical' peers.",
                "It allows for the measurement of small, non-linear progress steps that are meaningful to the individual's specific life context.",
                "It is the only measurement tool recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO).",
                "It focuses exclusively on the reduction of 'negative' autistic behaviors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GAS is highly sensitive to change and allows for individualized goals that reflect the 'spiky profile' of neurodivergent development."

            "question": "A Master Practitioner notices that a colleague is experiencing 'Vicarious Trauma.' According to the module, what is the most effective systemic intervention for the organization to implement?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious trauma is an occupational hazard; addressing it requires systemic support like reflective supervision rather than just placing the burden of 'self-care' on the individual."
