            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The BPNE model moves beyond clinical symptoms to look at the 'Ecological' fit—how the environment (architecture, social norms, sensory load) interacts with the individual's unique neuro-biology."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Role release is a hallmark of transdisciplinary leadership where experts teach each other key skills to ensure the client receives consistent, integrated care rather than fragmented advice from different silos."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that while top-down support is vital, 65% buy-in from middle management is the 'tipping point' required to ensure neuro-affirming policies are actually implemented and sustained."

            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to charge higher hourly rates for the same services",
                "It reduces the need for any clinical documentation or data tracking",
                "It separates income from 'hours worked' through the use of digital therapeutics and supervised practitioners",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic scaling (L6) involves moving away from the 'time-for-money' trap by creating systems, groups, and digital assets that provide value to more people simultaneously."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in the advanced data and future-proofing lessons, Data Sovereignty ensures that the neurodivergent individual remains the primary owner and gatekeeper of their biological and behavioral data."
