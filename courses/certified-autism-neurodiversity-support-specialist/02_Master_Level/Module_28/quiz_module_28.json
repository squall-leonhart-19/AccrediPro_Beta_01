            "question": "During a neuro-biological 'Amygdala Hijack' in an autistic individual, which part of the brain is temporarily offline, making logical reasoning ineffective?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Brainstem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In a state of high arousal or crisis, the Prefrontal Cortex (the seat of executive function and logic) becomes inaccessible as the limbic system takes over for survival, requiring co-regulation rather than reasoning."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis regarding Pica in neurodivergent populations found that the behavior is most frequently maintained by which functional reinforcer?",

                "Social attention",
                "Escape from demands",

                "Access to tangible items"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While behavior varies, Pica is most often maintained by automatic reinforcement (the sensory input of the item) or underlying nutritional deficiencies rather than social consequences."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "The term 'Diagnostic Overshadowing' in Lesson 3 refers to which clinical error?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnosing a child with Autism too early",
                "Attributing psychiatric symptoms to Autism rather than a co-occurring mental health condition",

                "Failing to recognize Autism in females due to masking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians attribute new or worsening symptoms (like anxiety or psychosis) to the patient's Autism, leading to missed psychiatric diagnoses."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In forensic settings, why are Autistic individuals at a higher risk of providing false confessions during police interrogations?",

                "They have a natural inclination toward criminal behavior",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to social communication differences, many neurodivergent individuals exhibit high suggestibility and 'compliance,' often agreeing with leading questions to end a stressful interaction."

            "id": "q28_5",

            "explanation": "For non-verbal individuals, trauma often manifests as 'behavioral language,' with skill regression being a primary indicator of psychological distress."

                "Is only experienced by doctors",
                "Is a purely physical condition",
                "Specifically involves the emotional residue of working with suffering and trauma",
                "Is resolved simply by taking a vacation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue is the 'cost of caring' and is specifically related to the secondary traumatic stress of working with individuals in crisis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Cassidy et al.) indicate that Autistic adults without ID have significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, often cited around 9 times the general population rate."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Functional Communication Training' (FCT) in the management of severe Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB)?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate all forms of communication",
                "To replace the SIB with a functional, socially acceptable way to request needs",
                "To use physical restraints to stop the injury",
                "To teach the client to use complex verbal sentences"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FCT is an evidence-based practice that identifies the 'purpose' of the SIB and teaches an alternative communication method (like a PECS card or sign) to achieve the same result."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "In the 'Post-Crisis Recovery' phase, when should the 'Collaborative Proactive Solutions' (CPS) debriefing ideally occur?",
            "options": [
                "While the client is still in a state of high arousal",
                "Immediately after physical restraint is released",
                "Once the client has returned to their physiological baseline and felt safety is restored",
                "Exactly 7 days after the incident"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Debriefing and problem-solving can only occur once the 'Window of Tolerance' has been re-entered and the client's nervous system is calm enough to process information."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Marcus' (Lesson 2), his severe head-banging was eventually traced back to which underlying medical issue rather than a behavioral choice?",
            "options": [
                "A desire for attention",
                "A severe dental abscess causing intense pain",
                "Lack of sleep",
                "Dislike of the classroom color"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Medical-First' rule emphasizes that sudden, intense SIB in non-verbal populations is frequently a response to untreated physical pain, such as dental issues or GI distress."
