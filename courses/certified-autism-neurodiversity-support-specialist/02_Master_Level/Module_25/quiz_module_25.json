            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological safety is built when leaders model vulnerability and treat mistakes as learning opportunities, which is vital for neurodivergent staff who may fear judgment for different processing styles."

            "options": [
                "The mentor should assume the mentee lacks empathy and needs social skills training",
                "The mentor must recognize that communication breakdowns are a two-way mismatch in processing styles, not a deficit in the mentee",
                "The mentor should only pair neurotypical mentors with neurodivergent mentees to encourage 'masking'",
                "The mentor should ignore communication styles and focus strictly on technical KPIs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that social difficulties between ND and NT individuals are a result of differing social realities rather than a one-sided deficit; mentors must bridge this gap bilaterally."
