            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Inclusive Corporate Leadership (L1), which recruitment modification has been shown to most effectively reduce bias against neurodivergent candidates during the hiring process?",
            "options": [
                "Using standardized personality assessments to filter candidates",
                "Replacing traditional unstructured interviews with skills-based work trials or 'auditions'",
                "Increasing the number of interviewers to ensure a consensus-based decision",
                "Requiring all candidates to complete a 2-hour timed IQ assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Skills-based trials allow neurodivergent candidates to demonstrate their competency in a practical environment, bypassing the social nuances and 'hidden curriculum' of traditional interviews that often lead to exclusion."

        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Research in Forensic Neurodiversity (L2) indicates that neurodivergent individuals are at a higher risk of providing false confessions. What is the primary psychological mechanism identified for this risk?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of moral reasoning or understanding of right and wrong",
                "High levels of suggestibility combined with a desire to please authority figures (compliance)",
                "An inherent inability to remember chronological sequences of events",
                "A physiological preference for high-stress environments such as interrogation rooms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to social communication differences and 'masking' behaviors, neurodivergent individuals may agree with leading questions or confess to end a high-stress social interaction with an authority figure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "When facilitating Higher Education Transitions (L3), what does the 'Hidden Curriculum' specifically refer to?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Hidden Curriculum' involves the social and organizational nuances of university life that neurotypical students often intuit but neurodivergent students may need explicitly explained."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In Geriatric Neurodiversity (L4), the term 'Diagnostic Shadowing' describes which clinical error?",
            "options": [
                "Attributing new symptoms of a medical condition (like a UTI) to the client's existing neurodivergence",
                "Failing to diagnose autism because the client has learned to mask perfectly over 60 years",
                "The tendency for sensory sensitivities to disappear as a person reaches age 70",
                "Assuming that all neurodivergent adults will eventually develop Alzheimer’s disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic shadowing occurs when clinicians overlook new health issues or psychiatric symptoms because they assume the behavior is simply a part of the person's autism or ADHD."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5 on Complex Comorbidity, what is a key consideration when treating a client with both ASD and PTSD?",
            "options": [
                "Standard Exposure Therapy should be used without any modifications",
                "Sensory triggers can mimic or exacerbate PTSD flashbacks, requiring a sensory-informed approach to trauma work",
                "Neurodivergent individuals are generally immune to the effects of psychological trauma",
                "The clinician should ignore the ASD diagnosis until the PTSD is fully resolved"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because of heightened sensory processing in neurodivergent individuals, certain sounds, lights, or textures can trigger a trauma response, making sensory regulation a prerequisite for trauma processing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "During an Emergency Response (L6), why is the 'Wait-and-Watch' or 'Distance-First' approach recommended for neurodivergent individuals in crisis?",
            "options": [
                "To give the responder time to fill out the necessary legal paperwork",
                "Because neurodivergent individuals are naturally aggressive and need to be contained",
                "To prevent triggering a 'fight-or-flight' response caused by invasive physical proximity or loud verbal commands",
                "Because neurodivergent crises usually resolve themselves within 5 minutes without intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapid physical intervention or loud shouting by responders can overwhelm the sensory system of a neurodivergent person, escalating a manageable meltdown into a dangerous acute crisis."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In Technological Innovations (L7), the concept of 'Cognitive Load' is critical. How does well-designed Assistive Tech (AT) address this?",
            "options": [
                "By providing as many features and buttons as possible on a single screen",
                "By using complex color-coding systems that require a manual to understand",
                "By minimizing unnecessary sensory input and simplifying the user interface to preserve mental energy",
                "By requiring the user to memorize complex keyboard shortcuts to access help"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective AT reduces the 'cognitive tax' on the user by simplifying tasks and reducing distracting stimuli, allowing the user to focus on the primary objective."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses Global Perspectives. In collectivist cultures, how might the perception of neurodiversity differ from Western individualistic models?",
            "options": [
                "It is always viewed as a medical pathology requiring institutionalization",
                "Neurodivergence is often seen through a 'family-centric' lens where the goal is communal harmony rather than individual independence",
                "Collectivist cultures do not recognize the existence of neurodivergence",
                "There is a strict preference for pharmacological intervention over behavioral support"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In many collectivist cultures, the focus of support is on how the individual fits into and contributes to the family unit, which may contrast with the Western focus on self-advocacy and independent living."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding Corporate HR (L1) found that neurodivergent teams are often more productive than neurotypical teams in specific tasks. What was the reported increase in productivity for certain technical roles?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5-10%",
                "Up to 30% higher productivity when matched with appropriate environmental supports",
                "Neurodivergent teams were actually 20% less productive due to communication needs",
                "Productivity remained exactly the same across all demographics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data from programs like SAP and Microsoft suggest that neurodivergent employees in roles matching their strengths (e.g., pattern recognition, attention to detail) can be 30% more productive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "When managing a 'Dual Diagnosis' (L5) involving Autism and Depression, why might traditional 'Behavioral Activation' (increasing activity levels) need modification?",
            "options": [
                "Because neurodivergent people do not experience depression",
                "Because increasing social activities without considering sensory burnout (autistic burnout) can actually worsen the depressive state",
                "Because behavioral activation is only effective for individuals with ADHD",
                "Because neurodivergent individuals cannot set goals for themselves"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard depression treatments often push for increased social interaction; however, if the client is experiencing 'autistic burnout' from over-socializing, this approach can be counterproductive and lead to further exhaustion."
