            "options": [
                "The Medical Model views autism as a pathology to be cured, while the Social Model views disability as the result of a mismatch between an individual's needs and their environment.",
                "The Medical Model focuses on environmental adaptations, while the Social Model focuses on pharmacological interventions.",
                "The Social Model suggests that neurodivergent individuals do not require any support or accommodations.",
                "The Medical Model prioritizes the lived experience of the individual, while the Social Model prioritizes clinical observation."
            ],
