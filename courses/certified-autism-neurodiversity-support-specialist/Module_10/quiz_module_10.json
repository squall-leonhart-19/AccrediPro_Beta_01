            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In K-12, IDEA focuses on student success and ensures services are provided. In post-secondary, the ADA and Section 504 focus on equal access, placing the burden of disclosure and self-advocacy on the student."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body Doubling is a common executive function support where the presence of another person (even if they are working on their own task) helps the autistic individual initiate and sustain focus on a task."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
