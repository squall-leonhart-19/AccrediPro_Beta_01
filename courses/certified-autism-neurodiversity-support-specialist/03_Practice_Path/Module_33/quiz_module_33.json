            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Article 12 of the UNCRPD emphasizes that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others, mandating a shift from 'substitute decision-making' (where others decide for them) to 'supported decision-making' (where they are assisted in making their own choices)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The interactive process is triggered when an employee requests an accommodation or when the employer has objective evidence that a known disability is interfering with job performance, even if a formal request hasn't been made."

            "question": "The 2017 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District fundamentally changed the 'FAPE' standard by stating that an IEP must be:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Endrew F. decision rejected the 'merely more than de minimis' standard, ruling that for a school to meet its IDEA obligations, it must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress that is 'appropriately ambitious' in light of their unique circumstances."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurological and biometric data are considered 'special category data' under GDPR, meaning they require more stringent protections, specific legal bases for processing, and typically explicit consent due to their sensitive nature."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supported Decision-Making (SDM) is considered the least restrictive alternative, as it allows the individual to retain their legal rights while utilizing a trusted team to help them understand, consider, and communicate decisions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4/5ths Rule is a guideline used by regulatory agencies (like the EEOC) to determine if a selection procedure has an adverse impact on a protected group. If the selection rate for one group is less than 80% of the rate for the highest group, it may indicate disparate impact."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client with ADHD and Autism requests a 'quiet zone' and flexible start times. The employer denies this, claiming 'Undue Hardship.' According to legal standards, what must the employer prove?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Undue hardship is defined as an action requiring 'significant difficulty or expense' when considered in light of factors such as an employer's size, financial resources, and the nature and structure of its operation. It is a high bar for employers to meet."

                "Only IDEA recognizes Autism as a qualifying condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IDEA is a grant-funded statute that provides specific 'special education' services via an IEP. Section 504 is a broader civil rights law that ensures 'access' and prohibits discrimination, applying to any entity receiving federal financial assistance, but it provides no additional funding."
