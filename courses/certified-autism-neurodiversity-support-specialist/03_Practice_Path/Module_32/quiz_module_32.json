                "It refers to the risk of clients forgetting to pay their sliding-scale fees",
                "It is the risk of over-diversifying revenue streams too quickly",
                "It is the danger of relying too heavily on a single insurance payer or government grant that may change its policies",
                "It refers to the cost of professional indemnity insurance premiums"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reimbursement Risk occurs when a practice is overly dependent on one source of income (like a specific insurance provider). Diversification into private pay, B2B consulting, and digital products mitigates this risk."
