            "options": [
                "To eliminate the need for any professional credentials or certifications",
                "To decouple revenue from the practitioner's individual hours worked by creating repeatable systems",
                "To ensure that every client receives a completely unique, non-standardized experience",
                "To reduce the quality of care in favor of reaching a higher volume of clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Productization involves turning a service into a standardized, repeatable product (like a course or framework), which allows the business to scale without requiring a linear increase in the founder's hours."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Licensing relies on the legal right to use another's Intellectual Property (IP). Without a proprietary methodology or system, there is nothing of value to license to other practitioners."

            "options": [
                "Because neurodivergence is viewed and supported differently across various cultural and legal landscapes",
                "Because it allows the practitioner to charge higher prices in every country",
                "Because it is a legal requirement for all Zoom-based businesses",

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
