            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Peer-led models excel at fostering 'Self-efficacy and sense of belonging' because the shared lived experience validates the participants' identities in a way clinical models often cannot."

                "It reduces the cost of the workshop by hiring non-professionals.",
                "It bridges the 'Double Empathy' gap by modeling neuro-diverse collaboration and providing dual perspectives.",
                "It allows the neurotypical facilitator to manage the 'difficult' behaviors while the peer handles content.",
