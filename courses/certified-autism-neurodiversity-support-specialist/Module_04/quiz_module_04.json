            "question": "Which neurological region is primarily responsible for the 'Executive Functioning' challenges observed in neurodivergent profiles, specifically regarding cognitive flexibility and impulse control?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Basal Ganglia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) serves as the brain's 'command center,' managing executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Interoception, often called the 'eighth sense,' is primarily processed in which part of the brain?",
            "options": [
                "The Insular Cortex",
                "The Cerebellum",

                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex (or insula) is the primary brain region responsible for processing interoceptive signals, which allow individuals to sense internal states like hunger, heart rate, and emotional arousal."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to research using the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q), what is a primary long-term consequence of high levels of social camouflaging?",
            "options": [
                "Improved social standing and long-term career stability",
                "A significant decrease in the need for sensory accommodations",

                "Permanent rewiring of the social brain to match neurotypical norms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High levels of masking or camouflaging are strongly correlated with mental health challenges, including chronic exhaustion (burnout) and increased rates of suicidality due to the intense cognitive load and loss of identity."

                "Autistic individuals lack the mirror neurons required for empathy.",
                "Social communication breakdowns are a bi-directional failure between two different 'dispositions.'",
                "Non-autistic people have a superior ability to empathize with all neurotypes.",
                "Empathy is a fixed trait that cannot be improved through environmental changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that social difficulties arise not from a deficit in the autistic person, but from a mutual lack of understanding between autistic and non-autistic individuals who have different ways of experiencing the world."

            "question": "A client has a measured IQ of 125 but a Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior score of 68. What does this 'support gap' typically indicate in a neurodiversity-affirming context?",
            "options": [
                "The IQ test was likely inaccurate and should be retaken.",
                "The client is 'lazy' and needs more motivation to apply their intelligence.",
                "High cognitive ability does not guarantee the ability to perform daily living skills independently.",
                "The client has a learning disability specifically related to mathematics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gap between IQ (potential) and Adaptive Functioning (daily application) is common in autism; high intelligence does not automatically translate to mastery of executive function-heavy tasks like self-care or organization."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses and clinical studies consistently show that 40-50% of autistic individuals experience co-occurring anxiety disorders, often exacerbated by sensory sensitivities and social stressors."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing written agendas is a structural/procedural accommodation that supports executive functioning and reduces anxiety, whereas the others are sensory modifications."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neurodiversity-Affirming Paradigm views neurodivergence as a natural human difference and focuses on environmental fit and support rather than 'fixing' or 'curing' the individual."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is engaging in social camouflaging by mimicking neurotypical body language, which consumes significant cognitive energy and leads to exhaustion/shutdown (autistic burnout)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body mapping and mindfulness-based interoceptive training help individuals identify internal signals (like a racing heart) and link them to emotional states (like anxiety), improving regulation."
