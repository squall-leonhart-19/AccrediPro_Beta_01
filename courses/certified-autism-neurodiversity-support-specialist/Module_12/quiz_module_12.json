            "question": "In the context of Workplace Integration, what is the primary objective of 'Job Crafting' for a Level 1 Autistic professional?",
            "options": [
                "To delegate all executive functioning tasks to an assistant",
                "To proactively redesign job tasks and boundaries to better align with sensory needs and cognitive strengths",
                "To hide autistic traits from colleagues to ensure career progression",
                "To strictly follow the original job description to avoid conflict"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Job crafting allows autistic professionals to modify their roles—such as adjusting task timing or environmental factors—to optimize performance and prevent burnout, rather than just seeking accommodations."

            "options": [
                "Autistic individuals lack the biological capacity for empathy",
                "Neurotypical partners are always more flexible in communication",
                "There is a bidirectional mismatch in communication styles and social expectations between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals",
                "The autistic partner fails to use 'theory of mind' during arguments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that social difficulties are a two-way street; both parties struggle to understand the other's internal state due to differing neurological dispositions."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A client in a high-stakes corporate environment reports 'Autistic Inertia.' Which intervention is most effective for this specific executive functioning challenge?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic inertia involves difficulty starting or stopping tasks; 'body doubling' (working alongside someone else) and external prompts are evidence-based strategies to overcome the 'start-up' cost of tasks."

            "options": [
                "Autistic burnout does not involve feelings of sadness",
                "Clinical depression is always caused by sensory overload",
                "Autistic burnout is characterized by a significant loss of previously mastered skills and reduced tolerance for sensory stimuli",
                "Autistic burnout only lasts for a few days, whereas depression is chronic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While they share symptoms, Autistic Burnout specifically involves a 'regression' in functional skills and a heightened sensitivity to the environment due to chronic masking and exhaustion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensory stacking is the accumulation of sensory inputs throughout the day that can lead to an autistic parent reaching their threshold, necessitating proactive sensory management."

            "question": "Research on intersectionality suggests that autistic individuals are approximately how much more likely to identify as LGBTQ+ compared to the general population?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as George & Stokes, 2018) consistently show that neurodivergent populations have a significantly higher prevalence of gender diversity and non-heteronormative sexual orientations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Re-authoring allows the individual to replace self-criticism (e.g., 'I was lazy') with neuro-affirming explanations (e.g., 'I was experiencing executive dysfunction')."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selective disclosure allows an individual to advocate for their needs and secure accommodations while maintaining privacy regarding their specific medical diagnosis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved when the work aligns with 'monotropism' (the tendency to focus deeply on specific interests), which reduces the energy cost of task switching and increases job satisfaction."
