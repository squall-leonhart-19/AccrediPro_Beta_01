            "question": "Research indicates a significant 'gap' in Level 1 Autism profiles. Which of the following best describes this discrepancy?",
            "options": [
                "High cognitive ability (IQ) paired with significantly lower adaptive functioning scores",
                "High social interest paired with low social motivation",
                "Superior verbal skills paired with low non-verbal reasoning",
                "High sensory seeking behaviors paired with low interoceptive awareness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'High Functioning' myth is debunked by the fact that many L1 individuals possess average to superior IQs but struggle significantly with adaptive behaviors (daily living skills), often scoring 2 standard deviations below their cognitive potential."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "According to Damian Milton's 'Double Empathy Problem,' where does the primary breakdown in communication lie?",
            "options": [
                "Solely within the autistic individual's inability to read social cues",
                "Within the neurotypical individual's lack of cognitive empathy",
                "In the bidirectional mismatch of communication styles between neurodivergent and neurotypical people",
                "In the delayed processing speed of the autistic amygdala"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns are a two-way street caused by differing lived experiences and communication styles, rather than a unilateral deficit in the autistic person."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Which executive functioning domain is most likely responsible for an L1 client being unable to start a task despite having a clear plan?",
            "options": [
                "Working Memory",
                "Task Initiation",
                "Inhibition",
                "Cognitive Flexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Task initiation is the ability to begin a project or activity in a timely manner. Autistic individuals often experience 'autistic inertia,' making the transition from rest to action difficult."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Interoception, often called the 'eighth sense,' is responsible for sensing which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The position of limbs in space",
                "External temperature changes",
                "Internal bodily states like hunger, heart rate, and emotional arousal",
                "The speed and direction of moving objects"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sensing of internal physiological conditions. Poor interoceptive awareness is common in L1 autism and is a primary driver of difficulties in emotional regulation."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A 2018 study by Cassidy et al. found that camouflaging (masking) was significantly associated with which outcome in autistic adults?",
            "options": [
                "Increased career promotion rates",
                "Higher levels of social satisfaction",
                "Increased risk of suicidality and mental health exhaustion",
                "Improved executive functioning scores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While masking may allow for temporary social 'success,' the cognitive and emotional cost is extreme, leading to burnout and a significantly higher risk of suicidal ideation."

            "question": "What is the estimated prevalence of Alexithymia within the autistic population compared to the general population (~10%)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 30-35%",

                "Approximately 85-90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that 40% to 65% of autistic individuals experience alexithymia, which is the difficulty in identifying and describing one's own emotions."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "When navigating the professional landscape, an 'implicit disclosure' strategy involves:",
            "options": [
                "Providing a formal clinical diagnosis to Human Resources",
                "Requesting specific accommodations (e.g., written instructions) without naming the diagnosis",
                "Hiding all autistic traits to appear neurotypical",
                "Educating the entire team on neurodiversity through a presentation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implicit disclosure focuses on the 'need' or 'solution' (e.g., 'I work best with written agendas') rather than the 'label' (e.g., 'I am autistic'), which can sometimes reduce stigma in the workplace."

            "options": [
                "Doing tasks for the client to prevent stress",
                "Removing all environmental supports to build 'grit'",
                "Creating external systems that support a client's autonomy until they can manage them or use them permanently",
                "Focusing exclusively on social skills training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves implementing external supports (checklists, visual timers, reminders) that bridge the gap between a client's intentions and their executive functioning limitations."

                "Having consistent, average abilities across all cognitive and social domains",
                "Exhibiting 'savant' skills in music while being non-verbal",
                "Excelling at complex software engineering while struggling to manage basic laundry and hygiene tasks",
                "Showing a steady decline in cognitive ability over time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'spiky profile' refers to the uneven distribution of skills where an individual has 'peaks' of high competence in some areas and 'valleys' of significant challenge in others."

            "options": [
                "The ability to ignore background noise over time",
                "The brain's inability to stop reacting to a repetitive stimulus (like a humming fridge)",
                "The preference for spicy or strong-tasting foods",
                "A total loss of one of the five primary senses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lack of habituation means the autistic brain continues to process repetitive sensory input as if it were new and urgent, leading to sensory overload and cognitive fatigue."
