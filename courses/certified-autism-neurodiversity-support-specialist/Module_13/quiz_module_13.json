            "question": "What is the primary legal distinction between the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regarding the 'Transition Cliff'?",
            "options": [
                "IDEA provides services based on eligibility, while ADA provides services based on entitlement.",
                "IDEA is a mandate for entitlement services in K-12, whereas ADA is a civil rights law requiring individuals to prove eligibility and self-advocate.",
                "IDEA and ADA both require schools to seek out students with disabilities to provide modifications.",
                "ADA requires the same level of individualized curriculum modifications as an IEP does in high school."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Transition Cliff' occurs because IDEA is an entitlement-based system where the school is responsible for identifying and serving the student. Under ADA in adulthood, the burden shifts to the individual to disclose their disability and prove eligibility for reasonable accommodations."

            "question": "A 2020 study on neuro-inclusive employment found that despite high cognitive abilities, the unemployment/underemployment rate for autistic adults remains significantly high. What is a key 'neuro-inclusive' strategy to improve retention?",
            "options": [
                "Requiring all employees to undergo standard high-stress interviews.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that environmental modifications (sensory) and structural clarity (written expectations) are more effective for retention than forcing the individual to conform to neurotypical social standards."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In higher education, privacy laws (FERPA) and the ADA dictate that the student is the primary lead. They must self-disclose and request accommodations; the institution will not seek them out."
