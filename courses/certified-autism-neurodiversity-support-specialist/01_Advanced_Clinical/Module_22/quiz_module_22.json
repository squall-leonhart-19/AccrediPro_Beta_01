            "question": "Which shift best characterizes the transition from the Medical Model to the Neurodiversity Paradigm in ethical practice?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from a focus on 'fixing' neurological deficits to providing accommodations that support 'difference'.",
                "Increasing the use of standardized IQ testing to determine eligibility for support services.",
                "Prioritizing behavioral extinction over the development of self-regulation skills.",
                "Ensuring that all neurodivergent individuals eventually meet neurotypical social benchmarks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Neurodiversity Paradigm views neurological variations as natural human differences rather than pathologies to be cured, shifting the ethical focus to support and accommodation."

            "options": [
                "To make the safest choice for the client when they are undecided.",
                "To defer all decisions to the legal guardian to minimize liability.",
                "To provide the necessary tools and information so the individual can exercise their own agency.",
                "To ensure the client's decisions align with the specialist's professional values."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SDM is an alternative to guardianship that emphasizes the individual's right to make their own choices with the support of a trusted network, preserving autonomy."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A 2018 study by Cassidy et al. found that 'camouflaging' or masking autistic traits was a significant independent predictor of what outcome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research indicated that the cognitive and emotional labor of masking is highly correlated with suicidality, making the ethical promotion of 'unmasking' a critical safety intervention."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "When working in small neurodivergent communities, a specialist may encounter 'dual relationships.' What is the most ethical approach to managing these?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately terminate the professional relationship if any social overlap occurs.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because neurodivergent communities are often tight-knit, dual relationships are sometimes unavoidable; the ethical response is transparency, boundary setting, and proactive discussion."

            "question": "According to data ethics research, approximately what percentage of mental health and neurodiversity apps were found to share user data with third parties (e.g., advertisers) in a 2022 study?",

            "options": [
                "It suggests that neurological traits are the only factor that matters in support planning.",
                "It highlights how overlapping identities (race, gender, class) create unique barriers to access and safety.",
                "It argues that all neurodivergent people experience the same level of systemic marginalization.",
                "It is a clinical term used to describe the intersection of two different neurodevelopmental disorders."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality recognizes that a person's experience of neurodivergence cannot be separated from their other identities, which often compounds systemic barriers and affects diagnostic accuracy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Support Specialists must recognize the limits of their role; clinical mental health crises require a referral to a licensed therapist or psychiatrist."

            "question": "Case Study: 8-year-old Leo's parents have consented to a social skills group. However, Leo consistently hides under the table and cries when the group starts. What is the ethical priority here?",
            "options": [
                "Continue the session because the legal guardians gave consent.",
                "Use a 'first-then' reward system to force Leo to participate.",
                "Respect Leo's lack of 'assent' and re-evaluate the intervention's impact on his well-being.",
                "Inform the parents that Leo is being non-compliant and needs stricter behavioral consequences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice distinguishes between legal 'consent' (given by parents) and 'assent' (the child's willingness). Withholding assent through distress is a signal that the intervention may be harmful or inappropriate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The paradox refers to the difficult choice neurodivergent individuals face: disclose to get necessary help, while risking the 'soft' discrimination and bias that often follows disclosure."
