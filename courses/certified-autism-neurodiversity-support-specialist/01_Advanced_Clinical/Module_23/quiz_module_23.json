            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory applications in sensory modulation, which branch of the nervous system must be activated to facilitate the 'Social Engagement System'?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex",
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex",
                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (VVC) is responsible for the 'social engagement system,' allowing for feelings of safety, connection, and optimal sensory processing."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for neurodivergent clients, 'Cognitive Defusion' is used primarily to help the client:",
            "options": [
                "Eliminate all negative or intrusive thoughts",
                "Change the literal content of their thoughts to be more positive",
                "Observe thoughts as language and symbols rather than absolute truths",
                "Force the brain to stop repetitive 'looping' thoughts through sheer will"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion involves creating distance from thoughts, viewing them as mental events rather than facts, which is often more effective for neurodivergent individuals than traditional CBT thought-challenging."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Metacognitive coaching differs from standard Executive Function (EF) training because it focuses on:",
            "options": [
                "External tools like planners and timers exclusively",
                "The 'how' of thinking, including self-monitoring and self-evaluation of strategies",
                "Behavioral rewards for completing tasks on time",
                "Memorizing specific sequences for daily living tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While EF training often focuses on the 'doing' (tools/tasks), metacognitive coaching focuses on the 'thinking about thinking,' helping clients evaluate which strategies work for their specific brain."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Interoception, often called the 'Eighth Sense,' is the brain's ability to process:",
            "options": [
                "The position of the body in space",
                "Internal physiological signals like heart rate, hunger, and bladder fullness",
                "The intensity of external light and sound",
                "Subtle social cues and non-verbal body language"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Difficulties here often lead to challenges in emotional regulation because the individual cannot feel the physiological precursors to an emotion."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "In Ross Greene’s Collaborative Proactive Solutions (CPS) model, 'Plan B' is defined by which three essential ingredients?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plan B involves the Empathy step (gathering information), the Define the Problem step (stating the adult's concern), and the Invitation step (collaborating on a solution)."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "The 'Double Empathy Problem,' proposed by Damian Milton, suggests that communication difficulties in autism are:",
            "options": [
                "A result of a deficit in the autistic person's theory of mind",
                "Caused by a lack of empathy in allistic (non-autistic) individuals only",
                "A bidirectional breakdown due to differing lived experiences and communication styles",
                "Purely a result of sensory processing disorders interfering with speech"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that autistic and non-autistic people both struggle to understand each other due to fundamental differences in disposition and social expectations."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "When applying trauma-informed care to neurodivergent populations, the 'Window of Tolerance' must be adjusted to account for:",
            "options": [
                "A narrower range of arousal due to baseline sensory processing sensitivities",
                "The fact that neurodivergent individuals do not experience trauma in the same way",
                "The elimination of the 'Freeze' response in autistic individuals",
                "The use of higher-intensity sensory input to 'shock' the system back to baseline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent individuals often have a narrower 'Window of Tolerance' because their baseline physiological arousal is often higher due to sensory and processing demands."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "A 2022 study on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback for autistic adults found that consistent training resulted in:",
            "options": [
                "A total cure for sensory processing sensitivities",
                "Significant increases in vagal tone and improved emotional self-regulation",
                "No measurable change compared to the control group",
                "Decreased cognitive flexibility during high-stress tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV biofeedback helps strengthen the parasympathetic response (vagal tone), which directly correlates with a better ability to regulate emotions under stress."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Leo' experiences intense meltdowns that seem to come out of nowhere. Using an interoceptive lens, what is the most likely underlying cause?",
            "options": [
                "Leo is intentionally being manipulative to avoid tasks",
                "Leo is unable to feel the gradual increase in his heart rate and muscle tension until he is in 'crisis' mode",
                "Leo has a primary deficit in auditory processing that makes him angry",
                "Leo lacks the 'Plan A' compliance skills required for his age group"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Poor interoceptive awareness often means individuals don't feel the 'build-up' of stress, making meltdowns appear sudden to both themselves and observers."

                "'Can you please set your timer for 20 minutes?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Asking what worked in the past encourages the client to reflect on their own cognitive processes (metacognition) rather than just following an external prompt."
