            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary driver of Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) according to recent neuro-biological frameworks?",
            "options": [
                "Intentional defiance and a desire to manipulate authority figures",
                "An anxiety-driven need for autonomy and self-governance to maintain safety",
                "A lack of cognitive ability to understand simple instructions",
                "A sensory processing disorder specifically related to auditory processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDA is increasingly understood as a 'Pervasive Drive for Autonomy,' where demands are perceived as threats to safety, triggering a fight-flight-freeze response rooted in high anxiety."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When supporting a non-speaking client in a state of acute crisis, what is the most critical first step for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting the client uses their high-tech AAC device to explain the problem",
                "Using physical prompts to guide the client to a 'time-out' area",
                "Reducing sensory input and providing 'low-demand' presence while monitoring physiological signs",
                "Verbally explaining the consequences of their behavior in detail"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In crisis, cognitive load must be minimized. Reducing sensory input and demands while providing a safe presence is prioritized over complex communication or behavioral consequences."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to research by Cassidy et al. (2014/2021), autistic adults are significantly more likely to experience suicidal ideation than the general population. What factor is most strongly correlated with this risk?",

                "High levels of 'camouflaging' or social masking",
                "Low intelligence quotient (IQ)",
                "Living in a rural geographic location",
                "Access to specialized neuro-inclusive healthcare"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Camouflaging (masking) is a major contributor to mental exhaustion, loss of identity, and increased suicidal ideation in the autistic community."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Why do traditional 12-step Substance Use Disorder (SUD) programs often fail neurodivergent clients?",
            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent clients do not experience physiological addiction",
                "The abstract language and heavy social/group requirements can be inaccessible or overstimulating",
                "Autistic individuals are statistically immune to the effects of alcohol",
                "12-step programs are too structured for the neurodivergent brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traditional programs rely heavily on metaphors, social nuances, and crowded group settings which can cause sensory overload and social exhaustion for neurodivergent individuals."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Autistic Burnout' is differentiated from clinical depression. What is a hallmark sign of Autistic Burnout?",

                "Consistent improvement in executive functioning under pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic Burnout is characterized by chronic exhaustion, loss of skills (regression), and reduced tolerance to sensory stimuli, which differs from the primary low-mood focus of depression."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When supporting an aging autistic client with suspected dementia, what is the phenomenon of 'Diagnostic Overshadowing'?",
            "options": [
                "A new diagnosis completely curing previous symptoms",
                "Attributing new cognitive decline symptoms solely to the client's autism rather than the onset of dementia",
                "The tendency for autistic people to hide their dementia symptoms",
                "When a caregiver's health issues overshadow the client's needs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diagnostic overshadowing occurs when clinicians attribute new behaviors or cognitive changes to a person's pre-existing neurodivergence, leading to missed diagnoses of treatable conditions or dementia."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A 2022 study on forensic settings found that autistic individuals are at a higher risk of false confessions. Why is this?",
            "options": [
                "They have a natural desire to break the law",
                "A tendency toward compliance with authority and difficulty processing the long-term implications of abstract legal rights",
                "They are statistically more aggressive during police interrogations",
                "They lack the ability to feel fear in high-stakes situations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Challenges with social communication, literal interpretation of language, and a desire to end a high-stress sensory environment (the interrogation) increase the risk of false confessions."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Which communication strategy is recommended when working with a client who has a PDA profile?",
            "options": [
                "Using 'Imperative' language (e.g., 'Do your laundry now')",
                "Using 'Declarative' language (e.g., 'I noticed the laundry basket is full')",
                "Implementing a strict reward-and-punishment token economy",
                "Increasing the frequency of direct eye contact and physical proximity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Declarative language reduces the 'demand' perceived by the PDA brain, allowing the individual to process information and choose to act autonomously without triggering a threat response."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Intersectionality in care (Lesson 7) suggests that a Black autistic individual may face 'Triple Jeopardy.' What does this refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The three stages of a medical diagnosis",
                "The intersection of racism, ableism, and the socio-economic barriers to specialized care",
                "Having three different neurodivergent diagnoses simultaneously",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When a neurodivergent client experiences a 'Sensory Flashback' related to C-PTSD, how does it differ from a standard PTSD flashback?",
            "options": [
                "It is always visual and follows a clear narrative timeline",
                "It may manifest as a sudden, unexplained 'meltdown' triggered by a specific sound, texture, or smell associated with the trauma",
                "It only occurs during sleep",
                "Neurodivergent individuals do not experience flashbacks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many neurodivergent individuals, trauma is stored and re-experienced through intense sensory fragments rather than linear, narrative memories, often leading to what looks like a meltdown."
