            "options": [
                "It is significantly shorter and easier to administer",
                "It measures fluid intelligence without heavy reliance on verbal instruction or cultural knowledge",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Raven’s Progressive Matrices is a non-verbal measure of fluid intelligence that often reveals higher cognitive potential in autistic individuals who may struggle with the heavy linguistic demands of tests like the WISC-V."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'spiky profile' refers to the common neurodivergent pattern where an individual may have 'peaks' of high ability in some areas (e.g., visual-spatial) and 'valleys' of significant challenge in others (e.g., processing speed or executive function)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To meet the criteria for ASD, an individual must demonstrate restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (Domain B). If these are absent but social communication deficits are present, a diagnosis of SCD is considered."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuro-affirming reports focus on descriptive, non-pathologizing language that acknowledges differences in communication styles rather than framing them as inherent failures or diseases."
