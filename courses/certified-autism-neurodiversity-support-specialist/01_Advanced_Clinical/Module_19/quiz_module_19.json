            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses sit at the top of the evidence hierarchy as they synthesize data from multiple high-quality RCTs, reducing individual study bias."

            "question": "In critical appraisal of autism research, what does a 'Cohen’s d' value of 0.85 typically indicate regarding an intervention's impact?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In behavioral sciences, a Cohen’s d of 0.2 is small, 0.5 is moderate, and 0.8 or higher is considered a large effect size."
