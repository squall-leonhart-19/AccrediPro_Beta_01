            "question": "A client with 'AuDHD' (Autism and ADHD) reports feeling paralyzed by a lack of structure but suffocated by rigid schedules. Which intervention strategy best addresses this 'AuDHD Paradox'?",
            "options": [
                "Implementing a high-flexibility 'menu-based' structure that allows for daily autonomy within set boundaries.",
                "Strict adherence to a minute-by-minute behavioral schedule to reduce anxiety.",
                "Removing all structure to allow the ADHD 'novelty seeking' to lead the day.",
                "Focusing exclusively on ADHD stimulant medication before addressing autistic sensory needs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The AuDHD paradox requires a 'flexible framework' where the Autistic need for predictability is met by a menu of options that satisfy the ADHD need for novelty and autonomy."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), what is the primary neurobiological driver of 'avoidance' behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "A desire to be oppositional and defiant toward authority figures.",
                "An anxiety-driven need for autonomy triggered by a perceived loss of control.",
                "Lack of understanding of the social hierarchy.",
                "Poor cognitive functioning and inability to process instructions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDA is increasingly understood as a profile where demands are perceived as threats to autonomy, triggering a survival-level anxiety response (fight/flight/freeze)."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When transitioning a non-speaking Autistic adult using AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication), what is considered a 'robust' system requirement?",
            "options": [
                "A system limited to basic needs like 'bathroom' and 'food'.",
                "A system that provides access to core vocabulary, fringe vocabulary, and the ability to generate novel sentences.",
                "A PECS binder with no more than 10 icons to prevent overwhelm.",
                "A text-to-speech app that requires the user to have perfect spelling before use."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A robust AAC system must allow for total communication (social, emotional, and functional) rather than just requesting items, supporting the user's right to self-determination."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Research indicates that ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) in neurodivergent populations is most frequently associated with which factor?",
            "options": [
                "Body dysmorphia and a desire to lose weight.",

                "Intentional power struggles with caregivers during mealtimes.",
                "A lack of appetite caused by a sedentary lifestyle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike Anorexia, ARFID in the ND population is typically sensory-based or trauma-based (fear of choking/vomiting) rather than driven by body image."

            "id": "q16_5",

                "A sudden improvement in executive functioning."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic Burnout is characterized by chronic exhaustion, loss of skills (like speech or self-care), and reduced tolerance to sensory stimuli, which are not standard features of major depressive disorder."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the 'Intergenerational Neurodivergence' model, the 'Double Empathy Problem' suggests that communication breakdowns occur because:",
            "options": [
                "Autistic people lack empathy for their non-autistic family members.",
                "Both parties have different 'operating systems' and social expectations, leading to mutual misunderstanding.",
                "The non-autistic parent is always right in their communication style.",
                "Neurodivergence is a behavioral choice that can be unlearned through family therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem (Milton, 2012) posits that communication issues are a two-way street between different neurotypes, rather than a deficit residing solely within the Autistic person."

            "question": "In forensic settings, why are Autistic individuals statistically more likely to give false confessions during interrogations?",
            "options": [
                "Because they are naturally more dishonest.",
                "Due to high levels of 'compliance' and 'suggestibility' when faced with authoritative pressure.",
                "Because they have a poor memory for their own actions.",
                "Because they do not understand the difference between right and wrong."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of social communication differences, a desire to please authority (compliance), and being overwhelmed by sensory/emotional stress makes ND individuals highly vulnerable to suggestibility."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "For a late-diagnosed adult (age 40+), the 'Trauma-Informed Integration' phase often involves 'Post-Traumatic Growth.' What is a key component of this process?",
            "options": [
                "Forgetting the past and focusing only on the future.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Late-diagnosed adults frequently go through a period of mourning for their 'lost' younger selves and the trauma of living decades without the correct 'user manual' for their brain."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of AuDHD prevalence (Lesson 1) suggests that approximately what percentage of Autistic individuals also meet the criteria for ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-25%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current research (e.g., Stevens et al., 2016) suggests a high co-occurrence rate, with studies showing between 30% and 80% of Autistic individuals also manifesting ADHD symptoms."

                "Identifying the 'problem person' and focusing all interventions on them.",
                "Normalizing neurodivergent traits across the family and identifying shared sensory/communication needs.",
                "Insisting that everyone in the family adopts a 'neurotypical' communication style for consistency.",
                "Separating the family members so they don't 'trigger' each other's neurodivergence."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective intergenerational support involves a systemic approach that validates the neurobiology of all family members and creates a 'Neuro-Inclusive' home environment."
