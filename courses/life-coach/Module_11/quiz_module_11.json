            "question": "In the neurobiology of momentum, which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for the 'reward-prediction error,' signaling the brain to maintain effort when a goal is within reach?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Dopamine",
                "Oxytocin",
                "GABA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary driver of the reward-seeking system. Phasic dopamine releases occur when the brain perceives progress toward a goal, creating the 'momentum' necessary to sustain effort."

            "options": [
                "Soft devices involve friends, while hard devices involve professional coaches.",
                "Soft devices are verbal promises, while hard devices impose a tangible cost or penalty for failure.",
                "Soft devices are for short-term goals, while hard devices are for long-term goals.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Hard Commitment Device (like a financial forfeit or a locked contract) creates a literal barrier or cost to quitting, whereas Soft Commitment relies on social pressure or internal willpower."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client consistently fails to lose weight despite having a perfect meal plan. You discover they use overeating to cope with social anxiety. This 'hidden benefit' of the problem is known as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that 'If-Then' planning significantly reduces the 'intention-behavior gap,' often doubling or tripling the likelihood of goal attainment compared to mere intention."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prospective theory and behavioral economics data show that loss aversion typically has a coefficient of 1.5 to 2.5, meaning losses 'loom larger' than gains."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lagging indicators are output-oriented and confirm results after the fact. While useful for ROI tracking, they cannot be influenced directly like 'Leading Indicators' (input-oriented behaviors)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard ROI formula subtracts the cost from the benefits to find the net gain, then divides by the cost and multiplies by 100 to get a percentage."

            "options": [
                "To ensure the client signs a new contract immediately.",
                "To identify high-risk situations and create pre-determined coping strategies.",
                "To convince the client that they can never succeed without the coach.",
                "To review the client's past failures one last time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relapse prevention is about sustainability; it involves identifying 'triggers' and 'slips' before they happen so the client can self-correct after the coaching relationship ends."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Upper Limit Problem is a form of subconscious sabotage where a person hits an internal 'ceiling' for positive energy and triggers a setback to return to a familiar, lower level of comfort."
