            "question": "In the context of Neuroplasticity and Advanced Cognitive Restructuring, what does the 'Hebbian Principle' specifically state regarding synaptic strength?",
            "options": [
                "Synaptic pruning occurs only during sleep cycles.",
                "Neurons that fire together, wire together, strengthening the synaptic connection through Long-Term Potentiation (LTP).",
                "Cognitive restructuring is impossible after the age of 25 due to brain lateralization.",
                "The brain's structure is fixed, and only functional changes occur in adulthood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hebbian Principle (1949) describes how repetitive stimulation of a synapse leads to Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), which is the cellular basis for learning and habit formation in coaching."

            "question": "Research on Somatic Intelligence suggests that individuals with high 'Interoceptive Awareness' are significantly better at emotional regulation. By what percentage does high interoceptive accuracy typically correlate with improved emotional resilience?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Exactly 50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies in somatic psychology indicate that high interoceptive awareness (the ability to sense internal bodily states) correlates with a 34-40% increase in the ability to regulate emotions effectively."

                "To predict the client's future financial success based on lineage.",
                "To map out family structures and identify recurring behavioral scripts, traumas, or 'ghosts in the nursery' across 3+ generations.",

                "To replace the need for the L.I.F.E. Blueprint™ entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Genograms allow Master Practitioners to visualize systemic patterns and 'loyalties' that influence a client's current behavior, often revealing unconscious transgenerational scripts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frankl's Tragic Triad (Pain, Guilt, and Death) represents the unavoidable aspects of human existence that coaches help clients find meaning within, rather than simply trying to eliminate."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "According to Behavioral Economics, 'Loss Aversion' dictates that the psychological pain of losing something is how much more powerful than the joy of gaining the equivalent amount?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Kahneman and Tversky's research shows that the 'pain of loss' is roughly twice as potent as the 'joy of gain,' a critical factor when a coach is framing choices for a client."

                "Immediately challenging the client's limiting beliefs.",
                "Focusing on long-term goal setting during the peak of the crisis.",

                "Refusing to work with the client until they seek medical intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a crisis, the client's prefrontal cortex is often offline. Stabilization (grounding and safety) must occur before any high-level coaching work can be effective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '4% Rule' suggests that flow is most likely to occur when the challenge slightly exceeds the skill level (by about 4%), providing enough tension to focus but not enough to cause anxiety."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "During the 'Integrative Synthesis' phase of the L.I.F.E. Blueprint™, the Master Practitioner aims to align which of the following?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
