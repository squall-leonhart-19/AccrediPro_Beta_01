            "question": "A client consistently fails to complete agreed-upon actions despite expressing a strong desire for change. You suspect 'Secondary Gain' is at play. What does this term specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The financial benefit a client receives from staying in a specific job role.",
                "The hidden psychological benefits or safety a client derives from maintaining their current 'stuck' state.",
                "The positive reinforcement a coach gives to a client to encourage progress.",
                "The secondary goals a client sets after achieving their primary objective."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the subconscious benefits (such as avoiding risk, receiving sympathy, or maintaining a sense of safety) that keep a client attached to a problematic situation despite their conscious desire to change."

                "The period of time a coach can ethically work with a traumatized client before referring out.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where a person is able to function and process emotions effectively. When a client moves into hyper-arousal (fight/flight) or hypo-arousal (freeze), they are outside this window and coaching should pause in favor of regulation."

            "question": "A high-performance client presents with 'Allostatic Load' symptoms. Based on the 2022 research discussed in Lesson 4, what is the physiological definition of this state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load represents the cumulative physiological toll on the body due to chronic stress. In high-performance clients, this often manifests as burnout when the body can no longer adapt to the demands placed upon it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an acute crisis involving safety risks, coaching must stop immediately. The coach’s role shifts to crisis management: ensuring the client is connected to emergency services or mental health professionals according to ethical and legal guidelines."

                "The client's 'difficult' personality."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a coach's personal values conflict with a client's, there is a risk of values imposition. The coach must use supervision to manage their countertransference and ensure they remain objective and supportive of the client's autonomy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with grandiose or difficult personality traits require firm boundaries and clear contracting. Focusing on objective data and specific outcomes helps keep the coaching relationship professional and prevents the coach from being drawn into the client's ego-driven dynamics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Upper Limit Problem is a self-sabotage mechanism that triggers when we exceed our internal limit for positive feelings, causing us to do something to 'bring ourselves back down' to a level where we feel safe or comfortable."

                "The client is feeling slightly nervous about a public speaking engagement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaching focuses on the present and future for functional individuals. When a client’s issues are 'ego-dystonic' (alien to their self-concept) or result in a functional impairment in daily life, it falls within the clinical domain of therapy."
