            "options": [
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR)",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the primary metric for assessing vagal tone and the flexibility of the autonomic nervous system in response to stressors."

                "How can we help the bird escape the cage?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clean Language uses the client's exact metaphors without adding the coach's own assumptions or leading suggestions. 'And what kind of [metaphor] is that [metaphor]?' is a classic clean question."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Symptom prescription is a paradoxical intervention where the client is encouraged to engage in the very behavior they are trying to avoid, which often bypasses resistance and shifts the internal dynamic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myelin is the fatty sheath that wraps around axons; increased myelination (through repetition) makes neural pathways faster and more efficient, turning conscious actions into automatic habits."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circular questioning (e.g., 'How do you think your wife reacts when your boss criticizes you?') helps the client see themselves as part of a larger, interconnected system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Timing in PETTLEP emphasizes that the mental rehearsal should take the same amount of time as the actual physical execution of the task to maximize neural transfer."

            "question": "A 2009 study by Lally et al. (referenced in L5) found that the average time for a behavior to become automatic (reach the 'asymptote of automaticity') was approximately:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the '21-day' myth persists, Lally et al. (2009) demonstrated that it takes an average of 66 days for a new habit to become automatic, with a range of 18 to 254 days."
