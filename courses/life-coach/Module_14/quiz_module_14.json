            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "According to the neuroscience of sustained execution, which brain region is primarily responsible for shifting a new behavior from effortful 'top-down' processing to automatic 'bottom-up' execution?",
            "options": [
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Basal Ganglia (specifically the Striatum)",
                "The Amygdala"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term execution relies on 'chunking' behaviors into the Basal Ganglia/Striatum, moving the cognitive load away from the energy-expensive Prefrontal Cortex."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced 'Listen' techniques, what does Antonio Damasio’s 'Somatic Marker Hypothesis' suggest about decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "Decisions should be made purely through logic to avoid emotional bias.",
                "Bodily sensations (gut feelings) act as bioregulatory signals that narrow down options before conscious reasoning occurs.",
                "Somatic markers are distractions that decrease the speed of neural processing.",
                "Interoception is only useful for physical health, not cognitive performance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Damasio's hypothesis posits that emotional/bodily signals (somatic markers) assist the decision-making process by highlighting potential outcomes based on past experiences."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Germane load is the effort used to create schemas and mental models; maximizing it (while reducing extraneous load) leads to superior skill retention."

            "question": "A 2011 study on Israeli judges found that favorable rulings dropped from 65% to nearly 0% just before meal breaks. This is a primary example of which concept from the 'Execute' phase?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hedonic Adaptation is the tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness, which often causes the 'slump' in the middle of long-term goals."

                "A robust system breaks easily, while an antifragile system stays the same.",
                "An antifragile system actually gains strength and improves from volatility, stressors, and disorder.",
                "A robust system is more flexible than an antifragile one.",
                "Antifragility is the same as resilience (bouncing back to the original state)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'resilient' systems resist shocks and stay the same, 'antifragile' systems benefit from shocks and grow stronger (e.g., muscle growth through weightlifting)."

                "The financial profit generated by a group coaching program.",
                "A specific type of feedback loop that causes a system to crash."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emergence occurs when a complex system exhibits properties that its individual parts do not possess (e.g., 'culture' is an emergent property of a group of individuals)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Default Option Bias utilizes 'opt-out' instead of 'opt-in' structures, significantly increasing the likelihood that the desired behavior is executed."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
