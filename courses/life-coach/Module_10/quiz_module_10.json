            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (If-Then plans) bridge the intention-action gap by automating the response to specific cues, significantly increasing the likelihood of execution compared to goal intentions alone."

            "question": "In the context of Habit Architecture, what did the 2010 study by Lally et al. conclude regarding the timeframe for behavior automaticity?",
            "options": [
                "Habits are universally formed in exactly 21 days",
                "Automaticity is a myth; habits require conscious effort forever",
                "The median time to reach peak automaticity is 66 days, with a range of 18 to 254 days",
                "Habits only form if the behavior is performed at the exact same time every day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lally et al. (2010) found that habit formation is highly variable, taking an average of 66 days to become automatic, debunking the popular '21-day' myth."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myelination is the process of forming a myelin sheath around a nerve fiber, which increases the speed and efficiency of electrical impulses, effectively 'hard-wiring' the habit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Immunity to Change' model posits that clients have hidden competing commitments (e.g., a commitment to staying safe/comfortable) that subconsciously sabotage their primary goals."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scores below the clinical cutoff on the ORS indicate levels of distress typically seen in clinical populations, signaling that the client's needs may exceed the scope of life coaching."
