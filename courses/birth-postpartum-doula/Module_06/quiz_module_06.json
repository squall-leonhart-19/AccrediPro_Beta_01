            "question": "In the neurobiology of labor breathwork (Mastery of 'B'), which physiological mechanism is primarily responsible for activating the parasympathetic nervous system during a prolonged exhalation?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exhalation stimulates the vagus nerve, which triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, lowering heart rate and blood pressure to promote a 'rest and digest' state during labor."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in B.R.A.I.N. stands for 'Nothing,' which encourages the client to ask about the consequences of waiting or declining an intervention, facilitating evidence-based advocacy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gate Control Theory suggests that stimulating large-diameter nerve fibers (via touch or vibration) can inhibit the transmission of pain signals from smaller fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord."
