            "question": "A client asks you to interpret the fetal heart rate patterns on the monitor because they are worried about the 'dips' they see. According to the Advanced Scope of Practice (L1), what is the most ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Explain that the dips are 'early decelerations' and are generally considered safe.",
                "Tell the client that you are not allowed to look at the monitor at all.",
                "Advise the client to ask for a C-section immediately to be safe.",
                "Acknowledge their concern and facilitate a conversation with the nurse or provider to interpret the clinical data."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Interpretive clinical data falls outside the doula's scope. The ethical path is to facilitate communication between the client and the medical team without offering a clinical diagnosis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is not to make decisions or speak for the client, but to protect the 'space' for the client to exercise their own autonomy through tools like BRAIN."

                "Competence is only required for medical staff, while humility is required for doulas.",
                "Humility is the process of learning specific facts about every ethnic group's birthing traditions.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility recognizes that one cannot 'master' another's culture and instead focuses on self-reflection and addressing the power dynamics inherent in the doula-client relationship."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual roles require 'clear boundaries.' This includes separate contracts or clear clauses regarding the scope of work and ensuring the appropriate liability insurance covers both sets of actions."

            "explanation": "Accepting undisclosed referral fees (kickbacks) creates a conflict of interest where the doula's recommendation may be motivated by financial gain rather than the client's best interest."
