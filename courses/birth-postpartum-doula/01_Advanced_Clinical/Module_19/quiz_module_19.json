            "options": [
                "Hospital staff (nurses/midwives)",
                "The client's partner or family members",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "From an endocrinological perspective, how does high maternal cortisol (the 'fight or flight' hormone) typically affect labor progression?",
            "options": [
                "It accelerates cervical dilation by increasing prostaglandin sensitivity.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High levels of cortisol and catecholamines can trigger the sympathetic nervous system, which inhibits oxytocin production and can slow or stall labor progress."

                "The actual medical interventions performed (e.g., forceps or C-section).",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on birth trauma indicate that the quality of care and the sense of agency/autonomy are more predictive of PTSD-birth than the specific medical mode of delivery."
