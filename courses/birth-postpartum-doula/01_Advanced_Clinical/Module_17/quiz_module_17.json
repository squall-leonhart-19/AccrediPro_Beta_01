            "question": "A client on strict hospital bed rest for PPROM (Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes) is at a significantly higher risk for clinical depression. According to research cited in Lesson 1, what percentage of women on hospital bed rest meet the criteria for clinical depression?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Up to 25%",

                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 30-44% of women on hospital bed rest experience clinical depression, significantly higher than the general pregnant population, necessitating specialized emotional support from a doula."

                "Responding by validating the client's feelings of fear."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resisting re-traumatization involves actively changing practices—such as ensuring continuous consent and avoiding triggering physical contact—to prevent the client from experiencing a trauma response."

                "It allows the family more time to bond and say goodbye by slowing the infant's physical changes.",
                "It is a required medical device for all hospitals in the US.",
                "It helps the baby transition to the NICU for observation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A CuddleCot cools the infant, which slows the natural physical changes after death, giving the grieving family hours or days of extra time to hold, photograph, and bond with their baby."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autistic individuals often experience sensory processing sensitivities; 'low-arousal' environments help prevent sensory overload and shutdown, allowing the client to maintain focus during intense labor."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the doula supports the entire 'birth team,' the gestational carrier is the patient undergoing the medical event and is the doula's primary physical and emotional support focus during labor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Social Model of Disability posits that people are disabled by barriers in society (like inaccessible rooms) rather than by their physical or mental impairments."
