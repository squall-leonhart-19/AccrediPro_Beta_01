            "question": "When addressing a fetus at the 'Outlet' (Station +2 to +4), which biomechanical adjustment is most effective for increasing the intertuberous diameter?",
            "options": [
                "External rotation of the femurs (knees out, heels in)",
                "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out)",
                "Deep squatting with a neutral pelvis",
                "Posterior pelvic tilt in a standing position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out) specifically widens the pelvic outlet by moving the ischial tuberosities further apart, providing more room for the head to emerge."

        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), what is the primary purpose of 'Somatic Anchoring' during the prenatal period?",
            "options": [
                "To physically restrain the client during intense contractions",
                "To create a stimulus-response trigger that evokes a state of deep relaxation",
                "To map the physical sensations of labor onto a visual chart",
                "To ensure the partner remains physically connected to the laboring person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic anchoring involves pairing a physical touch (the anchor) with a peak state of relaxation prenatally, allowing the doula to trigger that same relaxation response during active labor."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "The 'Shake the Apple Tree' Rebozo technique is specifically designed to achieve which physiological outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Forceful rotation of an OP fetus",
                "Cervical ripening through mechanical vibration",
                "Release of the pelvic floor muscles and fascia via rhythmic oscillation",
                "Induction of labor by stimulating the fundus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This technique uses gentle, rhythmic oscillation to relax the gluteal and pelvic floor muscles, which can help a 'stalled' labor by reducing resistance in the soft tissues."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "When applying acupressure to point SP6 (Sanyinjiao) to support labor progression, where should the doula apply pressure?",
            "options": [
                "The webbing between the thumb and index finger",
                "The highest point of the shoulder muscle",
                "Four finger-widths above the inner ankle bone, behind the tibia",
                "The center of the sole of the foot"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SP6 is located approximately four finger-widths (3 cun) above the medial malleolus (inner ankle bone) and is a key point for cervical dilation and labor strength."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "To prevent maternal hyperthermia and subsequent fetal tachycardia during advanced hydrotherapy, the water temperature should ideally be maintained between:",
            "options": [
                "90°F - 94°F (32.2°C - 34.4°C)",
                "95°F - 100°F (35°C - 37.7°C)",
                "101°F - 104°F (38.3°C - 40°C)",
                "Exactly 98.6°F (37°C) at all times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that water temperature should not exceed 100°F (37.7°C) to ensure the mother's core temperature remains stable, protecting the fetus from tachycardia."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "A client has an epidural and the fetus is at Station 0 (Mid-pelvis). Which 'Invisible Doula' technique best supports progression while respecting the medical intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to turn off the epidural pump",
                "The 'Exaggerated Side-Lying Release' with a peanut ball to open the mid-pelvis",
                "Frequent standing and swaying despite the motor block",
                "Manual rotation of the fetus by the doula"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-intervention settings, using a peanut ball in an exaggerated side-lying position (asymmetrical pelvic positioning) helps open the mid-pelvis and facilitates fetal rotation without requiring the client to stand."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "TENS units modulate labor pain through the 'Gate Control Theory.' Which nerve fibers are stimulated by the TENS unit to 'close the gate' to pain signals?",
            "options": [
                "C-fibers (slow, dull pain)",
                "A-delta fibers (fast, sharp pain)",
                "A-beta fibers (large-diameter sensory fibers)",
                "Motor neurons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TENS units stimulate the A-beta sensory fibers, which travel faster to the brain than the C-fibers carrying pain signals, effectively 'blocking' the pain messages from being fully processed."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Honor & Heal' (H) Advanced Protocol, the 'Integration' phase primarily focuses on:",
            "options": [
                "Physical wound healing of the perineum",
                "Nutritional replenishment using bone broths",
                "Processing the birth narrative to align the lived experience with the expected one",
                "Establishing a rigid sleep schedule for the newborn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration is the psychological component of the H&H protocol where the doula helps the client process the birth story, ensuring any 'trauma gaps' are addressed and the narrative is integrated healthily."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on TENS unit efficacy in labor found that users reported a significant reduction in pain scores and:",
            "options": [
                "A 50% reduction in C-section rates",
                "Higher levels of satisfaction with their birth experience and a sense of control",
                "A total elimination of the need for pharmacological analgesia",
                "Decreased labor duration by an average of 4 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While TENS may not eliminate pain, research consistently shows it significantly increases a client's sense of autonomy and satisfaction with their pain management strategy."

        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "When using the TENS unit, what is a critical safety contraindication for the doula to manage?",
            "options": [
                "The unit must be removed before the client enters a birth pool or shower",
                "Electrodes should never be placed on the lower back (S2-S4)",
                "The pulse frequency must never exceed 50Hz",
                "The unit should only be turned on during the second stage of labor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "TENS units are electronic devices and must be completely removed before any form of hydrotherapy (tub or shower) to prevent electric shock and damage to the unit."
