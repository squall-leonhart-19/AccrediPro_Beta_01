            "question": "According to the science of non-clinical assessment (L1), what is the primary distinction between a Doula's assessment and a clinical provider's assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Doulas perform internal exams while providers focus on vital signs.",
                "Doulas focus on subjective, physiological, and behavioral observations, whereas providers focus on clinical diagnostics and pathology.",
                "Providers use the EPDS scale while Doulas are required to use the PHQ-9.",
                "There is no distinction; Doulas and providers use the same diagnostic tools for labor progress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doulas provide non-clinical assessment, which relies on observing behavioral shifts, physiological markers (like the purple line), and emotional states, rather than diagnostic procedures like cervical exams or blood work."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as Byrne et al.) have shown that a longitudinal purple line extending from the anal margin up the intergluteal cleft is visible in roughly 75-80% of women and correlates with cervical dilation and fetal descent."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While thresholds can vary by provider, a score of 13 or higher on the EPDS is the standard clinical cutoff indicating a high probability of depressive symptoms requiring professional evaluation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the SBAR model (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation), the 'Assessment' phase is where the Doula shares their non-clinical observations (e.g., 'The client has been in a pattern of 3-1-1 for 2 hours and is showing signs of transition')."
