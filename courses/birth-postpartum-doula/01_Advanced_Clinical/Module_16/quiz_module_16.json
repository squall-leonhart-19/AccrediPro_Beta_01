            "question": "A client in the second stage of labor is experiencing persistent 'back labor' and slow descent. The doula suspects an Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which evidence-based maneuver is most effective for encouraging fetal rotation in a client with an epidural?",
            "options": [
                "The Miles Circuit",
                "The Side-Lying Release (SLR)",

                "Abdominal sifting with a rebozo"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While hands-and-knees is common, the Side-Lying Release (SLR) is specifically noted in advanced case studies for its efficacy in creating space in the mid-pelvis and pelvic outlet, especially when mobility is limited by an epidural."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (High-Risk Interventions), the 'Cascade of Intervention' is discussed. A 2021 retrospective study indicated that nulliparous clients receiving synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) for induction are approximately how much more likely to require an instrumental delivery (forceps/vacuum)?",
            "options": [
                "15% more likely",
                "30% more likely",
                "2.5 times more likely",
                "There is no statistically significant increase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the use of synthetic oxytocin, particularly in inductions, significantly increases the risk of the 'Cascade of Intervention,' leading to a 2.5 times higher likelihood of instrumental delivery compared to spontaneous labor."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A doula is supporting a survivor of childhood sexual abuse (L3). During a cervical check, the client becomes rigid, stops speaking, and stares at the ceiling. This behavior suggests the client has moved into which state?",

                "Hyper-arousal (Fight/Flight)",
                "Hypo-arousal (Freeze/Dissociation)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation and 'shutting down' are classic signs of hypo-arousal or the 'freeze' response, indicating the client has moved outside their Window of Tolerance due to a trauma trigger."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to support the parents in Kangaroo Care (skin-to-skin), which is clinically proven to stabilize infant heart rate, thermoregulation, and oxygen saturation while fostering parental confidence."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An EPDS score of 13 or higher is the standard threshold for a positive screen for depression, requiring a referral for clinical evaluation. 911 is reserved for immediate self-harm or psychosis (suicidal/homicidal ideation)."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the B.I.R.T.H. Method (Lesson 8), the 'I' stands for 'Intervention Analysis.' During a crisis, how does the doula apply this practically?",
            "options": [
                "By telling the doctor which intervention to use",

                "By documenting the intervention for legal purposes only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intervention Analysis within the B.I.R.T.H. method involves using tools like B.R.A.I.N. (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Next/Nothing) to facilitate informed consent during high-pressure situations."

            "explanation": "The first step of the B.I.R.T.H. method is 'Breathe and Baseline.' In a crisis, the doula must first regulate their own nervous system to effectively support the client and avoid escalating the panic in the room."
