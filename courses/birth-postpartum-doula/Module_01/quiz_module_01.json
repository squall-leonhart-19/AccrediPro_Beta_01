            "question": "According to the 'Philosophy of Presence' (L1), what is the primary distinction between a Doula's presence and a clinical provider's role?",
            "options": [
                "The Doula focuses on clinical outcomes while the provider focuses on emotional support.",
                "The Doula prioritizes 'Being' over 'Doing,' serving as a container for the birthing person's experience.",
                "The Doula is responsible for managing the medical equipment in the room.",
                "The Doula's primary role is to lead the medical team in decision-making."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that the 'B' Pillar is about ontological presence—the state of 'being' with the client, which provides a psychological safety net that clinical tasks cannot replace."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, a 2021 meta-analysis of 1,200 births found that structured breathing techniques resulted in which of the following statistical outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in the use of epidurals.",
                "No significant change in labor duration but higher satisfaction scores.",
                "An average reduction of 2.1 hours in the first stage of labor and lower cortisol levels.",
                "A 50% reduction in the need for instrumental delivery (forceps/vacuum)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific data from Lesson 2 highlights that rhythmic breathing optimizes oxygenation and reduces the stress response, leading to an average reduction of 2.1 hours in the first stage of labor."

            "question": "When teaching the 'Horselips' (Pursed Lip) technique in Lesson 3, what is the physiological mechanism that aids cervical dilation?",
            "options": [
                "It increases intra-abdominal pressure to push the baby down.",
                "The 'Sphincter Law'—relaxation of the mouth and jaw correlates with relaxation of the pelvic floor and cervix.",
                "It triggers the sympathetic nervous system to increase contraction strength.",
                "It prevents the client from vocalizing, which saves energy for the second stage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on the 'Sphincter Law' discussed in Lessons 3 and 6, there is a direct neuromuscular connection between the orofacial muscles and the pelvic sphincters."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Co-regulation.' How does a Doula’s internal state affect a birthing client physiologically?",
            "options": [
                "Through the activation of mirror neurons, the client’s nervous system tends to sync with the Doula’s calm state.",
                "The Doula must use verbal commands to force the client's heart rate to slow down.",
                "Co-regulation only works if the Doula and client have the same blood type.",
                "The Doula’s state has no impact on the client; it only helps the Doula stay awake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons allow the client to subconsciously pick up on the Doula's regulated heart rate and breathing, facilitating a shift from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the '5-4-3-2-1' Sensory Grounding technique (L5), what is the primary goal of asking a client to identify smells or tastes during a high-intensity moment?",
            "options": [
                "To check if the client is experiencing hallucinations.",
                "To distract the client so they forget they are in labor.",
                "To engage the prefrontal cortex and pull the brain out of a 'limbic hijack' or panic state.",
                "To ensure the hospital room is properly cleaned and sanitized."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory grounding forces the brain to process external data, which dampens amygdala overactivity and re-engages the cognitive centers of the brain during transition or panic."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 describes 'Low-Frequency Vocalization.' Why are low 'mooing' sounds preferred over high-pitched screams?",
            "options": [
                "High-pitched sounds are too loud for the hospital staff.",
                "Low sounds keep the energy moving downward and keep the throat open, whereas high sounds often involve throat constriction.",
                "Low sounds use less oxygen than high-pitched sounds.",
                "There is no physiological difference; it is simply a matter of preference."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency tones encourage an open glottis and a relaxed jaw, which prevents the 'fight or flight' constriction often associated with high-pitched screaming."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, what is the most effective way to use affirmations for a client experiencing 'Cognitive Dissonance' in labor?",
            "options": [
                "Using 'I am' statements that are future-oriented, like 'I will be happy tomorrow.'",
                "Using present-tense, rhythmic affirmations that match the client's breathing pattern.",
                "Repeating the same word over and over as loudly as possible.",
                "Affirmations are proven ineffective in clinical settings and should be avoided."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic, present-tense affirmations (e.g., 'In with strength, out with peace') work by creating a cognitive anchor that syncs with the physical rhythm of contractions."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the Case Study of 'Elena' (L8), she experienced a 'Transition Panic' characterized by shaking and saying 'I can't do this.' What was the Doula's first priority in re-centering her?",
            "options": [
                "Calling for the anesthesiologist immediately.",
                "Establishing direct eye contact and using 'Box Breathing' to lead her back to a rhythm.",
                "Telling her she is wrong and that she is doing it.",
                "Leaving the room to give her privacy to process her emotions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the L8 case study, the Doula used 'Vagal Brake' techniques—specifically eye contact and synchronized breathing—to pull Elena out of the adrenaline-induced panic of transition."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Rest and Be Thankful' phase mentioned in Lesson 8, and how should a Doula support it?",
            "options": [
                "A 15-minute break where the Doula goes to get coffee.",
                "A period of physiological lull before the pushing stage where the Doula should encourage silence and deep rest.",
                "The moment immediately after birth when the baby is placed on the chest.",
                "A mandatory paperwork session for the medical staff."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This phase is a natural pause in contractions before the second stage. The Doula supports this by minimizing sensory input and allowing the client to 'center' for the work ahead."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which specific breathing ratio was identified in Lesson 4 as the most effective for stimulating the Vagus nerve and lowering heart rate variability (HRV)?",
            "options": [
                "Inhale for 2, exhale for 2.",
                "Inhale for 8, hold for 8.",
                "Inhale for 4, exhale for 8 (Extended Exhale).",
                "Rapid, shallow panting (Upper chest breathing)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Extended Exhale' (doubling the length of the exhale) is the fastest way to stimulate the Vagus nerve and signal the brain to exit the sympathetic 'fight or flight' mode."
