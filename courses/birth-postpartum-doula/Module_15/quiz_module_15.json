            "question": "In the B.I.R.T.H. Response framework for complex labor patterns, what is the primary objective of the first step, 'B' (Breathe & Assess)?",
            "options": [
                "To immediately suggest a change in position to speed up labor",
                "To regulate the doula's own nervous system and gather objective data on the labor progress",
                "To check the client's dilation and effacement manually",
                "To call the OB/GYN and demand a medical intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The B.I.R.T.H. Method emphasizes that a doula must first regulate their own nervous system (Breathe) to provide a 'calm presence' and then objectively assess the situation before acting."

            "question": "When supporting a client with Preeclampsia who is receiving Magnesium Sulfate, which symptom should a doula be most observant of as a potential sign of toxicity?",

                "Increased energy and talkativeness",
                "Extreme thirst and dry mouth",
                "Loss of deep tendon reflexes and respiratory depression",
                "A sudden urge to push before full dilation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While doulas do not perform clinical assessments, being aware that Magnesium Sulfate can cause respiratory depression and loss of reflexes allows them to alert medical staff if the client appears overly lethargic or has difficulty breathing."

            "question": "A client is experiencing intense 'back labor' and the baby is confirmed to be in the Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which sequence of the Miles Circuit is used to encourage rotation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Miles Circuit specifically utilizes the Open Knee-Chest (to move baby out of the pelvis), Exaggerated Sims (to encourage rotation), and movement (to help baby descend in the new position)."

                "To take over the role of the neonatal nurse",

                "To document the exact time of every incision for the medical record"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A doula's role in a C-section is emotional and advocacy-based, helping to maintain the 'sacredness' of the birth through skin-to-skin facilitation and sensory support."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 2023 meta-analysis and various studies suggest that roughly 1 in 3 (approx. 33%) birthing people report their birth as a traumatic event, highlighting the need for trauma-informed care."

            "options": [
                "Baby Blues involves hallucinations, while PPD does not",
                "Baby Blues typically resolve within 10-14 days, whereas PPD symptoms persist longer and are more intense",
                "PPD only occurs in the first 48 hours after birth",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baby Blues are considered a normal hormonal shift affecting up to 80% of parents and resolving within 2 weeks. PPD is a clinical mood disorder that lasts longer and requires professional intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue is a specific type of secondary traumatic stress that occurs when a doula's emotional resources are depleted from absorbing the trauma or heavy emotions of their clients."

                "Contractions are too frequent (more than 5 in 10 minutes)",
                "Contractions are infrequent, short, or lack the intensity to dilate the cervix",
                "The uterus is in a state of constant contraction without rest",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypotonic labor (secondary arrest) occurs when labor starts normally but then contractions become weak or stop. This is often addressed with rest, hydration, or eventually Pitocin."
