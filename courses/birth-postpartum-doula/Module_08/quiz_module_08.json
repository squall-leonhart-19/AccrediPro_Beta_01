            "question": "According to the physiology of breathwork discussed in Lesson 1, which specific breathing pattern is most effective for rapidly offloading CO2 and triggering the 'vagal brake' to reduce acute labor anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Physiological Sigh' (two quick inhales followed by one long, slow exhale)",
                "Rapid clavicular breathing to increase oxygen saturation",
                "Holding the breath (Valsalva maneuver) during contractions",
                "Short, rhythmic 'pant-pant-blow' breathing throughout the transition phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The physiological sigh (double inhale, long exhale) is the fastest biological way to pop collapsed alveoli and trigger the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve, as supported by neurobiology studies on autonomic regulation."

            "question": "When utilizing the BRAIN tool for informed advocacy, what is the primary purpose of the 'N' (Nothing) component during a non-emergency medical suggestion?",
            "options": [
                "To refuse all medical interventions regardless of the situation",
                "To ask the provider for a 15-minute 'brain break' to rest",
                "To assess the physiological status quo and determine the risks of waiting or doing nothing",
                "To document that the medical provider offered no alternatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in BRAIN stands for 'What happens if we do Nothing?' It helps the client understand the clinical necessity and urgency of an intervention by comparing it to the current physiological baseline."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "In the context of pelvic biomechanics, if a baby is stalled at the -2 station (pelvic inlet), which maternal position is most evidence-based to create more space?",
            "options": [
                "Deep squatting with knees wider than feet",
                "External rotation of the hips (knees out, heels in)",
                "Internal rotation of the hips (knees in, heels out/asymmetric positions)",
                "Flat on the back with legs in stirrups (Lithotomy)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To open the pelvic inlet (top), internal rotation of the femurs is required. Conversely, external rotation (squatting) actually closes the inlet while opening the outlet."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Research on the 'Psychology of the Birth Narrative' indicates that the strongest predictor of postpartum Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is:",

                "The use of pharmacological pain management like an epidural"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (such as Beck et al.) show that the quality of support and the sense of agency/autonomy are more significant predictors of birth trauma than the specific medical mode of delivery."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "During the 'Golden Hour,' Widström’s 9 Stages of Newborn Behavior describes a specific phase where the infant moves toward the breast. What is this stage called, and when does it typically occur?",
            "options": [
                "The Awakening Stage; 2 minutes post-birth",
                "The Crawling Stage; approximately 35-45 minutes post-birth",
                "The Sucking Stage; 5 minutes post-birth",
                "The Sleeping Stage; 90 minutes post-birth"
            ],
            "explanation": "The 'Crawl' stage typically occurs around 35-45 minutes after birth, following the 'Rest' and 'Awakening' phases, provided the infant remains skin-to-skin and undisturbed.",

                "Keeping the surgical drape opaque and high at all times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moving EKG leads to the side or back allows the mother's chest to be clear for immediate skin-to-skin contact in the OR, which stabilizes the infant's heart rate and temperature."

                "10 times more likely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CDC data consistently shows that Black women face a maternal mortality rate 2.6 to 3 times higher than White women, a disparity that persists regardless of income or education level, highlighting systemic inequities."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doulas are non-clinical professionals. Performing clinical tasks like cervical checks, fetal heart monitoring, or blood pressure readings is a violation of the scope of practice."

                "Acting as the primary communicator between the neonatologist and the family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doulas help parents navigate the NICU environment by encouraging their role as primary caregivers, supporting Kangaroo Care, and helping them find their voice in a highly medicalized setting."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which hormone is known as the 'shy' hormone, requiring a sense of safety, privacy, and low light to peak during the postpartum physiological recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Adrenaline",
                "Cortisol",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is highly sensitive to the environment. High levels of adrenaline or catecholamines (caused by fear or bright lights) can inhibit oxytocin, potentially slowing labor or hindering the initial breastfeeding bond."
