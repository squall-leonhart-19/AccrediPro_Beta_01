            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the 'Peak-End Rule' discussed in Lesson 1, what two factors most significantly influence a client's long-term memory of their birth experience?",
            "options": [
                "The total duration of labor and the level of pain during the first stage",
                "The number of medical interventions and the cost of the hospital stay",
                "The most intense point of the experience and the feelings present at the conclusion",
                "The accuracy of the birth plan and the presence of extended family"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological research by Kahneman suggests that humans judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis mentioned in the module found that 'perceived control' was a more significant predictor of a positive birth experience than which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The specific mode of delivery (Vaginal vs. Cesarean)",
                "The presence of a partner",
                "The use of pharmacological pain relief",
                "All of the above"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The research emphasizes that agency and autonomy (perceived control) outweigh the physical events or interventions of birth in determining long-term psychological satisfaction."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, which physiological state is described as the 'antagonist' to Oxytocin, often triggered by bright lights and feeling observed?",
            "options": [
                "The Endorphin rush",
                "The Catecholamine (Adrenaline) response",
                "The Prolactin surge",
                "The Melatonin cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental stressors trigger the sympathetic nervous system, releasing catecholamines like adrenaline, which can stall labor by inhibiting oxytocin production."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When an unexpected medical shift occurs, what is the 'Transformative Bridge' a doula uses to maintain the client's resilience?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting the medical staff follow the original birth plan exactly",
                "Facilitating a 'pause' for the BRAIN acronym to ensure informed consent and agency",

                "Apologizing to the client for the failure of the birth plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transformation occurs when the doula helps the client transition from 'passive patient' to 'active participant' through informed decision-making, even during emergencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Liminality' in birth. How does ritual help a client navigate this state?",
            "options": [
                "By providing a symbolic container that validates the transition from woman to mother",
                "By speeding up the physiological process of cervical dilation",
                "By ensuring that no medical interventions are necessary",
                "By replacing the need for physical comfort measures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Rituals provide a psychological anchor during the 'in-between' state of labor, helping the client find meaning in the intensity of the transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "In the BRAIN communication tool, what does the 'N' stand for, and why is it a vital tool for the doula?",
            "options": [
                "Now; it emphasizes the urgency of every medical decision",
                "Nothing; it invites a 'wait and see' period to allow for physiological progress",
                "Next; it focuses the client on the postpartum period only",
                "Negotiate; it encourages the doula to argue with the OB/GYN"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking 'What happens if we do Nothing?' is a powerful tool for autonomy, often revealing that a situation is not an immediate emergency and allowing for a 'brain pause'."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "According to research on birth trauma (Lesson 7), what is the primary cause of 'Birth PTSD' reported by survivors?",
            "options": [
                "The physical pain of an unmedicated birth",
                "Having a Cesarean section instead of a vaginal birth",
                "The lack of support, poor communication, and loss of autonomy during the process",
                "The length of the second stage of labor (pushing)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that the quality of care and the level of respect/autonomy are higher predictors of trauma than the actual medical complications or mode of birth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When facilitating the 'Birth Story' integration (Lesson 8), why should a doula use 'Open-Ended Narrative' techniques?",
            "options": [
                "To correct the client's memory with the doula's personal notes",
                "To allow the client to process the subjective emotional truth before factual reconstruction",
                "To ensure the story matches the hospital's medical records exactly",
                "To minimize the time spent on the postpartum visit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration requires the client to own their narrative; the doula's role is to hold space for the client's perception before filling in chronological gaps."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client feels like they 'failed' because they chose an epidural after planning a home birth. Which response demonstrates the 'Reframing' technique from Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "'It's okay, at least you have a healthy baby.'",
                "'You didn't fail; you used your agency to make the best decision for your body in a changing situation.'",
                "'Maybe next time we can try different breathing techniques earlier.'",
                "'Most people end up getting the epidural anyway, so don't feel bad.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing focuses on the exercise of agency and the wisdom of the birthing person rather than the outcome versus the original plan."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which specific statistic from Lesson 7 highlights the doula's impact on preventing trauma?",
            "options": [
                "Doulas reduce the risk of Cesarean birth by 50% in all cases",
                "Continuous support is associated with a 31% decrease in the risk of being dissatisfied with the birth experience",
                "Doulas can eliminate the need for neonatal intensive care",
                "100% of doula-attended births are reported as 'perfect' by the parents"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2017 Cochrane Review found that continuous support (like that of a doula) significantly reduces the risk of negative birth perceptions and dissatisfaction."
