            "question": "According to advanced biomechanics, which maternal positioning strategy is most effective for opening the pelvic outlet during the pushing stage?",
            "options": [
                "External rotation of the femurs (knees out, heels in)",
                "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out)",
                "Deep squatting with a wide stance",
                "Strict lithotomy position with legs in stirrups"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out) increases the transverse diameter of the pelvic outlet by up to 2cm, providing more space for the fetal head to emerge."

                "No significant difference in cesarean rates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that the peanut ball significantly shortened the first stage of labor by approximately 90 minutes and the second stage by 23 minutes."

            "question": "The 2018 ARRIVE trial (n=6,106) compared elective induction at 39 weeks to expectant management. What was the primary finding regarding cesarean rates in low-risk nulliparous women?",
            "options": [
                "Induction increased the cesarean rate by 5%",
                "There was no statistical difference between the two groups",
                "Induction resulted in a lower cesarean rate (18.6% vs 22.2%)",
                "Expectant management resulted in a lower cesarean rate (15% vs 20%)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ARRIVE trial found that elective induction at 39 weeks for low-risk first-time mothers actually led to a lower rate of cesarean birth compared to expectant management."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. 'Background' provides the necessary context for the current situation."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client is experiencing intense 'back labor' and the provider suspects an Occiput Posterior (OP) position. Which technique is specifically designed to create space in the mid-pelvis by releasing the sacrotuberous ligaments?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Side-lying Release (SLR) helps balance the pelvic floor muscles and sacrotuberous ligaments, often providing the space needed for an OP baby to rotate to OA."

                "Immediate administration of sedative medication to the mother",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Family-centered cesareans prioritize immediate skin-to-skin contact in the operating room, which stabilizes infant temperature and glucose levels while promoting bonding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term hospital bedrest is associated with high rates of anxiety, depression, and a sense of loss of control or 'learned helplessness' due to the restricted environment."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which score typically serves as the threshold for a clinical referral for further evaluation?",
            "options": [
                "Any score above 0",
                "A score of 5 or higher",
                "A score of 10 or 13 (depending on clinical guidelines)",
                "Only a score of 25 or higher"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While thresholds vary slightly by provider, a score of 10 or 13 is the standard cut-off indicating a high probability of depressive symptoms requiring clinical follow-up."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all components matter, cervical dilation and effacement are heavily weighted, and a total score of 8 or more is highly predictive of a successful vaginal delivery."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client with an epidural is at 7cm and the baby is at -1 station (Inlet/Mid-pelvis). Which position would be most appropriate to help the baby descend through the mid-pelvis?",
            "options": [
                "Hands and knees with a flat back",
                "Asymmetrical side-lying (Flying Cowgirl)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asymmetrical positions like the 'Flying Cowgirl' (using a peanut ball to lift the top leg while side-lying) create pelvic shifting that helps the baby navigate the mid-pelvis."
