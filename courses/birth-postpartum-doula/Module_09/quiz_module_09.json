            "question": "In advanced lactation physiology, what is the primary role of the Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation (FIL)?",
            "options": [
                "To stimulate the anterior pituitary to release more prolactin",
                "To provide autocrine down-regulation of milk synthesis when the breast remains full",
                "To trigger the milk-ejection reflex in response to infant suckling",
                "To increase the permeability of tight junctions during the colostral phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FIL is a whey protein that provides autocrine (local) feedback; when milk is not removed, FIL accumulates and signals the lactocytes to slow down production, which is why frequent breast emptying is critical for supply."

            "question": "According to clinical guidelines for PMADs, how is 'Postpartum Blues' distinguished from Postpartum Depression (PPD)?",
            "options": [
                "Blues involve suicidal ideation, whereas PPD does not",
                "Blues typically peak between days 3-5 and resolve by day 14, while PPD lasts longer and is more severe",
                "Blues only occur after cesarean births, while PPD occurs after vaginal births",
                "Blues require pharmacological intervention, whereas PPD is managed with sleep alone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postpartum Blues affect up to 80% of parents and are transient, typically resolving within two weeks as hormones stabilize. PPD is more persistent and requires clinical intervention."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "During the 'Fourth Trimester' physiological recovery, what occurs to a person's progesterone levels within the first 48-72 hours postpartum?",
            "options": [
                "They increase significantly to support lactation",
                "They remain stable until the first menses returns",
                "They drop by approximately 100-fold, contributing to significant mood and physiological shifts",
                "They fluctuate wildly based on the frequency of infant skin-to-skin contact"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The delivery of the placenta triggers a precipitous drop in progesterone and estrogen (nearly 100-fold), which is one of the most drastic endocrine shifts in human physiology, triggering lactogenesis II and impacting neurotransmitter regulation."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When assessing a high-risk surgical recovery (Post-Cesarean), a Doula notices a client has unilateral calf swelling, warmth, and tenderness. What is the most appropriate evidence-based action?",
            "options": [
                "Massage the leg to improve circulation and reduce swelling",
                "Advise the client to perform vigorous leg lifts to clear the fluid",
                "Recognize these as signs of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and facilitate immediate medical evaluation",
                "Suggest a warm compress and reassess in 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unilateral swelling and warmth are classic red flags for DVT, a high-risk complication in the postpartum period (especially post-surgery). This is a medical emergency and outside the doula's scope to treat."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Infant neurobiology shows that newborns spend approximately what percentage of their sleep in REM (Active) sleep, and why is this significant?",
            "options": [
                "20%; it allows for deep physical restoration of the musculoskeletal system",
                "50%; it is critical for rapid brain development and synapse formation",
                "80%; it ensures the infant does not wake up during loud noises",
                "10%; infants primarily use NREM sleep to conserve calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infants spend about 50% of their sleep in REM (Active) sleep, compared to 20% in adults. This high percentage supports the intense neural branching and brain growth occurring in the first months of life."

            "question": "In the context of bereavement support, what is the most supportive approach when a family experiences a stillbirth?",
            "options": [
                "Using platitudes like 'Everything happens for a reason' to provide comfort",
                "Encouraging the family to move on quickly and clear out the nursery",
                "Validating their grief, using the baby's name, and offering to help create memories (mementos)",
                "Avoiding the topic of the baby to prevent further emotional distress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Best practices in bereavement care involve 'holding space,' validating the reality of the loss, and allowing the family to parent their child through memory-making and ritual."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "A family system is experiencing 'triangulation' after the arrival of a new baby. What does this typically look like in a postpartum household?",
            "options": [
                "The baby, parent, and doula all sleeping in the same room",
                "Two family members pulling in a third person to deflect tension or conflict between the original two",
                "A balanced distribution of chores between three adult household members",
                "The infant reaching developmental milestones in three distinct areas simultaneously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In family systems theory, triangulation occurs when a two-person dyad (like partners) experiences stress and pulls in a third party (like a grandparent or the doula) to stabilize the relationship, often creating unhealthy dynamics."

            "question": "To ensure professional sustainability and ethical practice, what is the 'Referral Threshold' for a postpartum doula?",
            "options": [
                "When a client asks for a recommendation for a baby carrier",
                "When a situation moves from 'normal' physiological/emotional adjustment into clinical pathology or beyond the doula's training",
                "Only when the doula's contract has ended",
                "When the doula feels tired and wants to go home early"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Referral Threshold is the point where a client's needs exceed the doula's non-clinical scope. Recognizing this early is essential for client safety and professional ethics."

            "question": "Which clinical sign most accurately distinguishes mastitis from simple breast engorgement?",
            "options": [
                "Both breasts feeling heavy and warm",
                "A localized red, painful area on one breast accompanied by flu-like symptoms and fever over 100.4°F",
                "Milk leaking from the nipples when the baby cries",
                "The baby having difficulty latching due to a flat nipple"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Engorgement is usually bilateral and lacks systemic symptoms. Mastitis is typically unilateral and involves systemic signs of infection like high fever, chills, and intense localized pain."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on infant sleep safety emphasizes that room-sharing (without bed-sharing) can reduce the risk of SIDS by up to what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "25%",
                "50%",
                "95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) notes that room-sharing (infant on a separate sleep surface in the parents' room) reduces the risk of SIDS by as much as 50% and is recommended for at least the first six months."
