            "question": "A doula is asked by a client to perform a vaginal exam to check dilation during a long labor. If the doula complies, which legal concept is primarily violated?",
            "options": [
                "Breach of Contract",
                "Practicing Medicine Without a License",
                "Informed Consent Negligence",
                "Vicarious Liability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Performing clinical assessments such as vaginal exams falls outside the non-clinical scope of practice for doulas and constitutes practicing medicine (or nursing/midwifery) without a license, which can carry criminal penalties."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "A doula's contract includes a 'Force Majeure' clause. During a sudden state-mandated hospital lockdown that prevents all visitors, how does this clause protect the doula?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the doula to sue the hospital for lost wages.",
                "It mandates that the client must pay a 200% 'hardship' fee.",
                "It excuses the doula from performing the in-person birth support due to unforeseeable, external circumstances.",
                "It automatically transfers the doula's duties to a medical resident."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Force Majeure clauses protect parties when 'acts of God' or unforeseeable circumstances (like a pandemic or government lockdown) make it impossible to fulfill the terms of the contract."

            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "A doula purchased a 'Claims-Made' professional liability policy in 2023 and canceled it in 2024. A client from 2023 files a lawsuit in 2025. Is the doula covered?",
            "options": [
                "Yes, because the incident happened while the policy was active.",
                "No, unless the doula purchased an 'Extended Reporting Period' or 'Tail' coverage.",
                "Yes, because liability insurance is retroactive for 5 years by law.",
                "No, because doulas are not eligible for liability protection after retirement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Claims-made policies only cover claims filed while the policy is active. To be covered for a past incident after the policy ends, the professional must purchase 'tail coverage.'"

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "While many independent doulas are not technically 'Covered Entities' under HIPAA, why is it considered best practice to maintain HIPAA-level encryption (AES-256) for client records?",
            "options": [
                "State consumer privacy laws (like CCPA) often mirror HIPAA requirements for sensitive data.",
                "It is a mandatory requirement for all LLCs regardless of industry.",
                "It prevents the doula from being sued for medical malpractice.",
                "It allows the doula to prescribe medications electronically."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Even if not a federal 'Covered Entity,' state laws and professional ethics require the protection of sensitive health information; failing to use industry-standard encryption like AES-256 can be seen as negligence in a data breach."

            "question": "An agency owner hires five doulas. The owner sets their schedules, provides their equipment, and prohibits them from working for other agencies. Under the IRS 'Control Test,' these doulas are likely:",

                "Statutory Volunteers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The IRS determines worker status based on behavioral control, financial control, and the relationship type. Dictating schedules and providing equipment are hallmarks of an employer-employee relationship."

        {
            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "In the context of Informed Consent and the 'BRAIN' acronym, what does the 'I' stand for, and what is the doula's role regarding it?",
            "options": [
                "Intervention; the doula decides if it is necessary.",
                "Insurance; the doula checks if the procedure is covered.",
                "Intuition; the doula encourages the client to check in with their inner feelings about the decision.",
                "Indication; the doula explains the medical reason for the procedure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the BRAIN framework (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing), the 'I' stands for Intuition. The doula's role is to facilitate the client's self-advocacy, not to provide medical indications."

            "question": "To receive reimbursement through Medicaid in states like Oregon or California, what is a primary regulatory requirement for a professional doula?",

                "A surety bond of at least $100,000."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "State integration for Medicaid reimbursement typically requires doulas to obtain an NPI number and register as a provider within the state's healthcare system."

        {
            "id": "q33_8",
            "question": "A doula is sued for 'Negligent Misrepresentation.' The client claims the doula promised a 'pain-free birth' in her marketing materials. This highlights the importance of which legal concept?",
            "options": [
                "Avoidance of 'Guaranteed Outcomes' in marketing and contracts.",
                "The 'Good Samaritan' law protection.",

                "The use of arbitration instead of mediation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Doulas must avoid guaranteeing specific physiological outcomes (like a 'pain-free' or 'natural' birth) in their contracts and marketing, as these are beyond their control and can lead to lawsuits for misrepresentation."

        {
            "id": "q33_9",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between Mediation and Arbitration in a doula-client dispute?",
            "options": [
                "Mediation is always free; arbitration is expensive.",
                "Mediation is legally binding; arbitration is just a conversation.",
                "Mediation involves a neutral third party facilitating a mutual agreement; Arbitration involves a third party making a final, binding decision.",
                "Arbitration is only for criminal cases; mediation is for civil cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mediation focuses on reaching a voluntary agreement between parties, while arbitration is a more formal process where an arbitrator acts like a judge to issue a binding ruling."

            "id": "q33_10",
            "question": "A doula's contract includes a 'Liquidated Damages' clause regarding late cancellations. For this clause to be legally enforceable, the fee must be:",
            "options": [
                "At least 90% of the total contract value.",
                "A reasonable estimate of actual damages, not a penalty.",
                "Approved by a local magistrate before the contract is signed.",
                "Paid in cash only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liquidated damages must represent a fair estimate of the loss incurred by the doula (e.g., lost opportunity to book another client) rather than a punitive 'penalty' intended to punish the client."
