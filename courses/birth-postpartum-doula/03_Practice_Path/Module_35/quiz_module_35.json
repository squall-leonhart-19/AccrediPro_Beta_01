            "question": "When transitioning from a solo practitioner to an agency owner, which factor most critically determines the 'Control Test' for classifying doulas as 1099 Independent Contractors versus W-2 Employees?",
            "options": [
                "The amount of money paid to the doula per birth.",
                "Whether the agency provides the doula with specific equipment and dictates the exact methods of care.",
                "The length of time the doula has been certified by an external body.",
                "Whether the doula works for more than one agency simultaneously."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The IRS and labor boards primarily look at the 'degree of control' an agency exerts. If the agency dictates the specific methods, tools, and timing of the work, the worker is more likely to be classified as an employee (W-2) rather than a contractor (1099)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Operational excellence in scaling requires a rigorous three-stage vetting process to ensure that new hires not only have the skills but are also a perfect fit for the agency's culture and client service standards."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hybrid models allow an agency to charge premium prices (often $2,000+) by offering a mix of pre-recorded education and direct access to expertise, which provides better client outcomes and higher profit margins than 'passive' courses alone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Corporations and insurance providers are driven by data. Highlighting the reduction in medical interventions (like C-sections) and the corresponding decrease in healthcare costs and employee recovery time is the key to securing institutional contracts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SOPs are the 'blueprint' of the business. They ensure that the brand's quality remains consistent as the agency grows, allowing the founder to step back from daily operations while maintaining high service standards."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Licensing is a way to monetize intellectual property. The licensee pays for the right to use the proven system/brand, but they generally retain more operational independence than a franchisee would."
