            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance.",
                "It creates a 'corporate veil' that protects personal assets from business liabilities.",
                "It automatically reduces the federal self-employment tax rate by 15.3%.",
                "It guarantees that the doula cannot be sued for breach of contract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary benefit of an LLC is the creation of a 'corporate veil,' which separates personal assets (home, savings) from business liabilities, ensuring that the owner is not personally responsible for business debts or legal judgments."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "explanation": "To ensure long-term sustainability and avoid 'tax shock,' experts recommend setting aside approximately 30% for taxes and 20% for operational reinvestment (marketing, systems, education), leaving 50% as owner's pay/profit."

            "explanation": "The Rule of Three suggests a sustainable rhythm of no more than 3 births per month, at least 3 days of complete 'off-call' time per week (via a partnership/backup model), and 3 diversified income streams (birth, postpartum, and digital products/education)."

            "question": "A doula practice is analyzing its 'Revenue Diversification.' If 100% of income comes from birth support, why is this considered a 'high-risk' financial model?",
            "options": [
                "Because birth support is not in high demand.",
                "Because it relies entirely on 'active' income and the doula's physical presence, making the business vulnerable to illness or burnout.",
                "Because birth clients never return for postpartum services.",
                "Because birth support is usually taxed at a higher rate than other services."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relying solely on active income (trading time for money) is risky because if the doula cannot physically attend a birth due to illness or exhaustion, the revenue stops. Diversification (e.g., classes, products) creates 'passive' or 'scalable' revenue."
