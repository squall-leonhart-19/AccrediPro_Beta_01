            "question": "In the context of Advanced Advocacy (L1), what is the 'Diplomatic Resistance' strategy when navigating systemic obstacles in a hospital setting?",
            "options": [
                "Directly contradicting the OB/GYN to show the client you are on their side",
                "Using 'I' statements and clarifying questions to slow down the momentum of a non-emergent intervention",
                "Filing a formal complaint with the hospital board during the active labor process",
                "Remaining silent to avoid 'blacklisting' while documenting everything for later"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diplomatic Resistance involves using 'Soft Power'—slowing down the clinical momentum through inquiry and clarifying the client's 'BRAIN' assessment without creating a confrontational atmosphere that could negatively impact the client's care."

            "question": "According to Somatic Intelligence theory (L2), how does 'Co-Regulation' function between a Master Doula and a laboring client?",
            "options": [
                "The doula performs massage to manually lower the client's cortisol levels",
                "The doula uses verbal commands to force the client into a meditative state",
                "The doula maintains a regulated ventral vagal state, which the client's nervous system 'tunes' to via neuroception",
                "The doula mirrors the client's panic to show empathy and shared experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation relies on the doula's ability to remain in a regulated Ventral Vagal state. Through neuroception and mirror neurons, the client's autonomic nervous system can shift from a sympathetic (fight/flight) state toward a more regulated state."

            "question": "A client is experiencing a 'stalled' labor at 7cm with the baby in an Occiput Posterior (OP) position at +1 station. Which biomechanical maneuver (L3) is most appropriate for the pelvic OUTLET?",
            "options": [
                "The Walcher’s Position to open the inlet",
                "External rotation of the femurs to widen the mid-pelvis",
                "Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, heels out) to widen the intertuberous diameter",
                "A closed-knee squat to encourage the baby to move back up to the inlet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "At +1 station and below, the baby is moving through the pelvic outlet. Internal rotation of the femurs (knees in, toes out) widens the outlet/intertuberous diameter, whereas external rotation narrows it."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "When supporting a survivor of sexual abuse (L4), a 'Dissociative' response during labor is often identified by which physiological sign?",
            "options": [
                "Extreme vocalization and thrashing",
                "A 'thousand-yard stare,' flat affect, and sudden loss of presence",
                "Increased heart rate and hyperventilation",
                "Aggressive verbal pushback against the nursing staff"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a 'freeze' or 'faint' response where the survivor mentally leaves the body to cope with perceived threat. A flat affect and 'thousand-yard stare' are hallmark indicators of this trauma response."

            "question": "In a High-Stakes Crisis such as a Shoulder Dystocia (L5), what is the Master Doula’s primary biomechanical contribution while the medical team performs Gaskin or McRoberts?",
            "options": [
                "Performing a fundal pressure maneuver to push the baby out",
                "Maintaining the 'Calm Center' for the partner and assisting the client into the requested position (e.g., Flip-FLOP) with precision",
                "Taking over the medical communication to tell the doctor what to do",
                "Leaving the room to give the medical team space"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Master Doula provides 'Somatic Anchoring' for the partner/client and facilitates rapid, calm movement into positions like the Gaskin (all fours) if the medical team is utilizing the Flip-FLOP protocol."

                "Creating a 'Sanctuary of Time' where the parents can hold, bathe, and name the baby without being rushed",
                "Focusing exclusively on the physical recovery of the birthing person"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Honoring the baby involves acknowledging their personhood. Master Doulas facilitate rituals, photography, and slow, intentional time for the parents to bond and say goodbye, which is critical for the long-term healing process."

                "A doula can act as a clinical nurse and a doula simultaneously if they have both licenses",
                "A doula must never be friends with their clients",
                "A doula should avoid performing clinical tasks (like vaginal exams) even if they have the skill, to maintain the integrity of the support role",
                "A doula should take over the role of the partner if the partner is not performing well"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical leadership requires maintaining the scope of practice. Performing clinical tasks creates a 'Dual Role' conflict that can jeopardize the doula's liability and the specific emotional/advocacy nature of the doula-client relationship."

                "The seamless synthesis of clinical knowledge, biomechanical mastery, and somatic awareness applied in real-time",
                "A strict adherence to a 5-step checklist for every birth regardless of the situation",
                "Focusing only on the postpartum period and ignoring the birth process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intuitive Integration is the hallmark of a Master Practitioner—the ability to assess a complex situation (like a malposition combined with a trauma trigger) and respond with a synthesized, multi-layered intervention."

            "question": "A 2021 study on 'Trauma-Informed Obstetric Care' found that what percentage of survivors felt 're-traumatized' by lack of communication during exams?",

                "Approximately 15%",
                "Over 80% in some specific demographics",

                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Seng et al.) consistently show that roughly half of survivors find the lack of agency and communication during physical exams in labor to be a significant trigger for re-traumatization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynclitism is the lateral tilt of the fetal head. Master Doulas use 'side-lying release' or 'asymmetrical lunges' to help the head align properly with the pelvic axis."
