            "question": "A client is hospitalized for Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) at 29 weeks and placed on strict bedrest. According to Module 27, Lesson 1, what is the doula's primary psychological priority?",
            "options": [
                "Strictly monitoring the fetal heart rate monitor for the client",
                "Mitigating 'institutionalization' and loss of autonomy through environment personalization",
                "Encouraging the client to avoid all movement, including sitting up",
                "Providing medical advice on the efficacy of corticosteroid injections"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term hospital bedrest often leads to a loss of identity and autonomy. Doulas provide 'environmental advocacy,' helping the client personalize their space and maintain a sense of self in a clinical setting."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "In the context of perinatal loss and bereavement (Lesson 2), what does the 'Holding Space' framework prioritize when a family receives a terminal diagnosis in utero?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the family to 'move on' quickly to avoid prolonged grief",
                "Directing the family toward immediate surgical intervention",
                "Supporting 'parenting through the loss' by facilitating memory-making and ritual",
                "Discouraging the family from seeing or touching the infant after birth"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based bereavement care emphasizes 'parenting through the loss,' which includes creating tangible memories (photos, molds, hair snips) and allowing the parents to spend as much time as needed with their child."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "When supporting a neurodivergent birthing person (Lesson 3), why might traditional 'visualization' techniques for pain management be ineffective or frustrating?",
            "options": [
                "Neurodivergent people cannot feel pain in the same way",
                "Many autistic individuals experience 'aphantasia' or prefer literal, concrete sensory feedback over abstract imagery",
                "Visualizations are too physically taxing for neurodivergent clients",
                "Neurodivergent clients always require an epidural and cannot use natural techniques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many neurodivergent individuals process information literally. Abstract visualizations can be confusing; instead, doulas should use concrete sensory tools like weighted blankets, specific temperature changes, or 'bottom-up' sensory grounding."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights LGBTQ+ affirming care. What is the significance of using the term 'Chestfeeding' in a clinical or support setting?",
            "options": [
                "It is only used for cisgender women who have had top surgery",
                "It is a medically inaccurate term that should be avoided in hospitals",
                "It is a gender-neutral or trans-masculine affirming term that recognizes the diversity of bodies that lactate",
                "It is a term specifically reserved for adoptive parents using supplemental nursing systems"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Affirming language like 'chestfeeding' or 'body-feeding' acknowledges the gender identity of the parent, reducing the 'minority stress' that often leads to poorer health outcomes in LGBTQ+ populations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Regarding Substance Use Disorder (SUD) in Lesson 5, what is the 'Eat, Sleep, Console' (ESC) model mentioned as a best practice for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)?",
            "options": [
                "A strict pharmacological approach using high doses of morphine",
                "A method that prioritizes parental presence, skin-to-skin contact, and low-stimulation environments over immediate medication",
                "A technique where the infant is separated from the mother for 48 hours to detox",
                "A feeding schedule that requires formula instead of breastmilk for all SUD cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ESC model is a function-based assessment that prioritizes non-pharmacological care. A 2023 study showed it significantly reduced the length of hospital stays and the need for opioid treatment in newborns."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "When working with adolescent or teen clients (Lesson 6), what is a key developmental consideration for the doula?",
            "options": [
                "Teens are legally unable to make any medical decisions for themselves",
                "The doula should take over all decision-making to protect the teen",
                "Supporting the 'Emerging Autonomy' by providing information in small, digestible pieces and respecting their role as the primary parent",
                "Teens should be treated exactly like 30-year-old clients to avoid bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adolescents are in a stage of developing autonomy. Doulas support this by facilitating 'informed consent' in a way that empowers the teen to be the leader of their own care, rather than a passive recipient."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In a gestational surrogacy arrangement (Lesson 7), who is typically the doula's 'primary' client for labor support, and who is the 'primary' client for postpartum support?",
            "options": [
                "The Intended Parents for both",
                "The Gestational Carrier for both",
                "The Gestational Carrier for labor; the Intended Parents (and baby) for postpartum",
                "The Surrogate Agency is the only client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In surrogacy, the doula supports the Gestational Carrier (GC) through the physical process of labor. Postpartum, the doula often transitions to helping the Intended Parents (IPs) with newborn care and bonding."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 discusses Multiples. What is a statistically significant risk factor for twin pregnancies that a doula should be prepared to support?",
            "options": [
                "Twin pregnancies rarely go past 32 weeks",
                "Approximately 50-60% of twins are born preterm (before 37 weeks), often requiring NICU navigation",
                "Twins always require a Cesarean birth by law",
                "There is no increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage with multiples"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Over half of all twin births are preterm. Doulas specialized in multiples must be experts in NICU support, pumping logistics, and the emotional toll of having babies in the hospital while recovering at home."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A neurodivergent client experiences 'shutdown' during a high-intensity hospital shift change. What is the most appropriate doula response based on Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the volume of your voice to get their attention",
                "Minimize sensory input (dim lights, silence), use written communication if needed, and give the client time to process",
                "Ask the client multiple complex questions to keep them engaged",
                "Immediately call for a psychiatric consult"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During a shutdown or sensory overload, neurodivergent individuals need 'sensory reduction.' Doulas should act as a buffer, reducing noise and light, and using 'low-demand' communication (like thumbs up/down or written notes)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to the statistics provided in the module regarding LGBTQ+ birthing experiences, what percentage of gender-diverse individuals reported 'misgendering' by healthcare providers during their birth experience?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Over 40-50% in various qualitative studies",
                "Misgendering does not occur in modern hospitals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as those by the National Center for Transgender Equality) show high rates of misgendering and discrimination in reproductive care, which the doula helps mitigate through advocacy and staff education."
