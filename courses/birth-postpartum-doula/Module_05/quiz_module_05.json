            "question": "During the 'Golden Hour,' the 'Nine Instinctive Stages' (Widström et al., 2011) describe the newborn's transition. Which stage typically occurs immediately after the birth cry and is characterized by the infant remaining quiet and still on the mother's chest?",
            "options": [
                "The Crawling Stage",
                "The Resting Phase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Resting Phase (Stage 2) occurs immediately after the birth cry. The infant typically remains quiet and still, allowing for physiological stabilization and thermoregulation."

            "options": [
                "Lochia rubra should transition to lochia serosa (pinkish-brown) by Day 4-10.",
                "Lochia should be completely finished by Day 7.",
                "Lochia alba (white/yellow) should have started by Day 5.",
                "Bright red discharge is only normal for the first 24 hours."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lochia rubra typically lasts 1-4 days. By Day 8, the discharge should be Lochia Serosa. A return to bright red bleeding (rubra) after it has lightened may indicate overexertion or retained placental fragments."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Splinting involves placing a pillow or hands firmly over the incision site during sudden movements or coughing to provide counter-pressure, which significantly reduces sharp pain and protects the internal sutures."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Doulas provide education and comfort measures. Suggesting non-pharmacological techniques like reverse pressure softening is within scope; prescribing, diagnosing, or performing clinical manual expression is not."
