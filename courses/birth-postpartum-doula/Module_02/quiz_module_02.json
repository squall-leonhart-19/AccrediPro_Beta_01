            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP relies on research, clinical expertise, and client values. A doula's personal experiences should not dictate the evidence provided to a client."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Ferguson Reflex is the neuroendocrine surge of oxytocin triggered by pressure on the cervix and vaginal walls, leading to the involuntary urge to push."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Cascade of Care' describes how one intervention, like induction, often necessitates further interventions like continuous monitoring, epidurals, and instrumental delivery."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is to facilitate the client's own decision-making process through frameworks like BRAIN, rather than giving medical advice or advocating 'for' the client."
