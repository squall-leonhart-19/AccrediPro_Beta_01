            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "During the first stage of labor, a client is struggling with a fetus in an Occiput Posterior (OP) position at a -1 station. Which pelvic level should the doula primarily focus on opening?",
            "options": [
                "The Pelvic Inlet",
                "The Mid-pelvis",
                "The Pelvic Outlet",
                "The Pubic Arch"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At -1 station, the fetus is engaged in the mid-pelvis. Techniques like the asymmetric lunge or side-lying release are used to create space in the mid-pelvis to facilitate internal rotation from OP to OA."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client is being pressured into a medical induction. According to the Bishop Score criteria, which score indicates that the cervix is 'ripe' and the induction is highly likely to result in a vaginal birth?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 3 or less",
                "A score of 4 to 5",
                "A score of 8 or higher",
                "A score of exactly 6"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Bishop Score of 8 or higher is statistically associated with a high likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery following induction, similar to the chances of spontaneous labor."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A doula is supporting a high-risk client with preeclampsia. Which symptom reported by the client should be treated as an immediate clinical emergency requiring notification of the nursing staff?",
            "options": [
                "Mild swelling in the ankles and feet",
                "Sudden epigastric pain or right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain",
                "Increased fetal movement",
                "A single blood pressure reading of 135/85"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigastric or RUQ pain is a 'red flag' symptom indicating hepatic (liver) involvement or subcapsular hematoma, which are severe features of preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "During a vacuum-assisted delivery, what is the doula's primary role within their professional scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Monitoring the vacuum pressure gauge for the physician",
                "Explaining the fetal heart rate decelerations to the partner",
                "Providing emotional grounding and encouraging the client to push with the contractions as directed",
                "Assisting the doctor in placing the suction cup on the fetal scalp"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The doula's role remains non-clinical. They provide emotional support and help the client stay focused and calm during the instrumental intervention while the medical team handles the procedure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In the context of a 'Gentle Cesarean' (Family-Centered Cesarean), which of the following practices is specifically designed to facilitate immediate physiological bonding?",
            "options": [
                "The use of a solid blue drape to maintain a sterile field",
                "Positioning EKG leads on the mother's back to allow for skin-to-skin in the OR",
                "Administering a general anesthetic to the mother",
                "Taking the baby to the nursery immediately for assessment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moving EKG leads to the back prevents wires from obstructing the chest, allowing the infant to be placed directly on the mother's skin while the surgical team completes the procedure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "When supporting a family through a perinatal loss or stillbirth, which communication strategy is recommended by bereavement experts?",
            "options": [
                "Using euphemisms like 'passed away' or 'gone to sleep' to soften the blow",
                "Avoiding the baby's name to prevent further emotional distress",
                "Using clear, honest language and following the parents' lead on naming and holding the baby",
                "Telling the parents they can 'always try again' to provide hope"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clear, honest language (e.g., 'died' or 'stillborn') helps parents process the reality of the loss. Validating their parenthood and using the baby's name is crucial for the grieving process."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Postpartum Psychosis is a rare but severe complication. According to clinical statistics, what is the approximate incidence rate of this condition?",
            "options": [
                "1 in 10 births",
                "1 to 2 per 1,000 births",
                "50% of all postpartum women",
                "1 in 5,000 births"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postpartum Psychosis is a psychiatric emergency occurring in approximately 1-2 per 1,000 births, requiring immediate medical intervention and often hospitalization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A doula notices a client has significant vaginal bleeding (soaking a pad in 15 minutes) two weeks postpartum. What is the most appropriate action according to the doula's scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Perform a fundal massage to stop the bleeding",
                "Advise the client to take an herbal supplement like Shepherd's Purse",
                "Instruct the client to call their provider or go to the ER immediately as this indicates a late PPH",
                "Tell the client this is a normal part of the lochia rubra phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soaking a pad in 15-30 minutes at any point postpartum is a sign of hemorrhage. The doula must refer the client to emergency medical care and cannot perform clinical tasks like fundal massage or prescribe supplements."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which position is most effective for opening the pelvic outlet during the second stage (pushing) to resolve a suspected 'outlet dystocia'?",
            "options": [
                "Lying flat on the back (Lithotomy)",
                "Knees together with ankles turned outward (Internal rotation of the femurs)",
                "Knees wide apart in a deep squat (External rotation of the femurs)",
                "Semi-fowler's position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While counter-intuitive, internally rotating the knees (knees in, ankles out) actually widens the pelvic outlet by moving the sitz bones (ischial tuberosities) further apart."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Research indicates that Visual Estimation of Blood Loss (EBL) is often inaccurate. By how much is blood loss typically underestimated when using visual estimation rather than Quantified Blood Loss (QBL)?",
            "options": [
                "EBL is usually 10% higher than actual loss",
                "EBL is usually accurate within 5%",
                "EBL typically underestimates blood loss by 33% to 50%",
                "EBL is only inaccurate in Cesarean sections"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that visual estimation (EBL) consistently underestimates actual blood loss by 33-50%, which is why many hospitals are moving toward weighing pads (QBL) for better hemorrhage detection."
