            "question": "According to the Gate Control Theory of Pain discussed in Lesson 1, how does TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) effectively reduce labor pain?",
            "options": [
                "By chemically blocking the opioid receptors in the brain.",
                "By stimulating large-diameter nerve fibers to 'close the gate' to slower pain signals.",
                "By increasing the production of cortisol to mask physical discomfort.",
                "By inducing a hypnotic state that alters the perception of time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TENS works on the Gate Control Theory, where non-painful tactile stimulation of large-diameter nerve fibers inhibits the transmission of pain signals from smaller fibers at the spinal cord level."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-risk inductions, the doula's role shifts toward emotional support, informational reinforcement, and helping the client maintain a sense of agency despite medical necessity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Skin-to-skin contact regulates the infant's temperature, heart rate, and breathing, while also reducing the risk of hypoglycemia by stabilizing blood sugar."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While thresholds vary, a score of 10-13 is generally the cutoff for potential depression, and any positive score on Question 10 (suicidal ideation) requires immediate referral."
