            "question": "When supporting a client through a perinatal loss, which communication strategy is most aligned with trauma-informed bereavement care?",
            "options": [
                "Using euphemisms like 'passed away' or 'lost' to soften the impact.",
                "Validating the baby’s personhood by using their name and acknowledging the client as a parent.",
                "Encouraging the client to 'look on the bright side' because they can conceive again.",
                "Avoiding talk about the baby to prevent triggering the client's grief."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validating the baby's personhood and the client's role as a parent is a cornerstone of bereavement support, whereas euphemisms and 'silver lining' statements can minimize the trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurodivergent individuals often experience sensory overload; a low-sensory environment helps maintain regulated nervous system function during high-intensity labor phases."

            "question": "A client diagnosed with severe Preeclampsia is being administered Magnesium Sulfate. What specific side effect should the doula prepare the client for to manage expectations?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Sulfate is a CNS depressant; clients typically feel very hot, heavy, and lethargic, which can be distressing if they are not prepared for the sensation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Side-Lying Release targets the pelvic floor (specifically the levator ani group), creating more 'room' for the baby to rotate into an Occiput Anterior position."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Survivors often feel a loss of control during exams; 'Pause and Permission' gives them the power to lead the pace, which helps prevent dissociation and re-traumatization."

            "question": "Research indicates that Black women in the U.S. are approximately 2.6 to 3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than White women. Which factor is cited as a primary driver of this disparity?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collagen is the primary structural protein in skin and connective tissue; its synthesis requires specific amino acids (Proline/Glycine) and Vitamin C as a cofactor."

            "question": "A client is experiencing 'Asynclitism' (the baby's head is tilted to the side). Which position would a doula suggest to help correct the fetal head alignment?",

                "Flat on the back with legs in stirrups.",
                "Asymmetrical positions, such as 'The Miles Circuit' or 'Side-Lying Release' on the opposite side of the tilt.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asymmetrical positions create uneven space in the pelvis, which can encourage the fetal head to level out (correcting the tilt) and engage more effectively."
