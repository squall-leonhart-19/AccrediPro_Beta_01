        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "Within The B.I.R.T.H. Support Method™, the 'B' (Breathe & Center) phase is primarily designed to mitigate the 'Fear-Tension-Pain' cycle. Which physiological mechanism is most directly influenced by this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system to increase cortisol",
                "Stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system to promote endogenous oxytocin release",
                "Suppression of the prefrontal cortex to induce a state of 'labor land'",
                "Increasing maternal heart rate variability to improve fetal oxygenation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breathe & Center techniques ground the mother, triggering the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest). This counteracts the catecholamine response (adrenaline) which can stall labor, and promotes the release of oxytocin, the primary driver of effective contractions."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "The 'I' in the B.I.R.T.H. Method stands for 'Inform & Educate.' When a client is faced with a medical intervention like an induction, which tool should the doula facilitate to ensure informed consent?",
            "options": [
                "The Apgar Score assessment",
                "The BRAIN acronym (Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, Intuition, Nothing)",

                "The Friedman Curve analysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BRAIN acronym is a foundational tool in the 'Inform & Educate' pillar. It empowers clients to ask critical questions about benefits, risks, alternatives, what their intuition says, and what happens if they do nothing, ensuring they remain the primary decision-makers."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "According to the 2017 Cochrane Review (Bohren et al.) on continuous support for women during childbirth, mothers supported by doulas saw what percentage reduction in the likelihood of a Cesarean birth?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "25%",
                "39%",
                "52%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis of 26 trials involving over 15,000 women found that continuous support, particularly from doulas not employed by the hospital, resulted in a 39% decrease in the risk of Cesarean birth."

        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "In the 'R' phase (Reassure & Comfort), a doula utilizes the 'Gate Control Theory of Pain.' Which of the following is a practical application of this theory?",
            "options": [
                "Providing evidence-based research on epidural efficacy",
                "Using TENS units or sterile water injections",
                "Applying counter-pressure or massage to 'crowd' the neural pathways with non-painful stimuli",
                "Encouraging the mother to visualize a opening flower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Gate Control Theory suggests that non-painful input (like massage or counter-pressure) closes the 'gates' to painful input, preventing pain sensations from traveling to the central nervous system. This is a core 'Reassure & Comfort' strategy."
        },

            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "During the 'T' phase (Transform the Experience), the doula's role is to help create a positive birth memory. Research indicates that the primary factor in maternal birth satisfaction is:",
            "options": [
                "The absence of medical interventions",
                "The total duration of the labor",
                "The quality of support and involvement in decision-making",
                "The successful initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that maternal satisfaction is more closely tied to the quality of care and the mother's sense of agency/involvement in decisions than to the actual mode of delivery or the use of pain medication."

            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "In the 'H' phase (Honor & Heal), a postpartum doula identifies a client scoring a 14 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). What is the appropriate clinical action?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest the client starts taking St. John's Wort immediately",
                "Advise the client that this is a normal part of the 'Baby Blues'",

                "Increase doula visits to 24-hour care to ensure the baby is safe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A score of 13 or higher on the EPDS is a strong indicator of possible depression. While the doula provides emotional support (Honor & Heal), clinical diagnosis and treatment must be handled by a licensed professional."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is highly sensitive to the environment. High levels of adrenaline (caused by stress or lack of privacy) inhibit oxytocin, which is why 'Breathe & Center' focuses on creating a safe, private environment."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "A client in Level 2 Advanced Case Studies presents with a 'sunny-side up' baby (Occiput Posterior). Which position is most evidence-based for encouraging fetal rotation?",

                "Semi-fowler position"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asymmetric positions and forward-leaning gravity-neutral positions like hands-and-knees help the heavy back of the fetal head rotate toward the mother's anterior, easing back labor and facilitating descent."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "In Module 13 (Advanced Clinical Support), you encounter a client experiencing a 'precipitous labor' (labor lasting less than 3 hours). What is the doula's priority while waiting for medical assistance?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging the mother to 'push hard' to get it over with",
                "Performing a vaginal exam to check for crowning",

                "Administering herbal tinctures to slow contractions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The doula's role is non-clinical. In a precipitous birth, the doula uses 'Breathe & Center' (panting breaths) to prevent perineal tearing and maintains a calm environment ('Reassure & Comfort') until medical help arrives."

            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "Regarding 'Honor & Heal' and newborn physiology, 'The Golden Hour' refers to the first 60 minutes post-birth. What is the primary benefit of uninterrupted skin-to-skin during this time?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the hospital staff to complete the newborn exam faster",
                "It regulates the infant's temperature, heart rate, and blood sugar while stimulating colostrum production",
                "It ensures the baby will never develop jaundice",
                "It is the only time the Vitamin K shot can be administered effectively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Skin-to-skin contact (the 'Honor' part of the transition) has profound physiological benefits for both mother and baby, including thermoregulation and the initiation of the first feed."

            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "In Module 33 (Legal & Compliance), which document is essential for defining the doula's scope of practice and protecting the practitioner from liability?",
            "options": [
                "A medical license",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A professional contract is vital for defining what a doula *does* and *does not* do (e.g., no clinical tasks), which is the primary protection against legal misunderstandings."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PPH is a medical emergency. Doulas do not perform clinical interventions (like fundal massage in a medical capacity) but must recognize the signs and facilitate immediate emergency medical care."
