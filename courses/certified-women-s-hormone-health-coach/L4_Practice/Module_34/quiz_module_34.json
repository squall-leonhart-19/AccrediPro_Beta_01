            "question": "When designing the 'Architecture' of a scalable hormone program, what is the primary advantage of a 'Cohort-Based' model over a 'Rolling Enrollment' model for hormonal health?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for higher profit margins per individual student.",
                "It fosters a shared bio-individual journey, increasing peer-to-peer accountability and completion rates.",
                "It requires less marketing effort as the program is always open.",
                "It eliminates the need for the coach to facilitate live sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cohort-based models create a 'community effect' where participants move through the HARMONY Method™ phases together, significantly increasing psychological safety and adherence compared to isolated rolling enrollment."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In the context of the HARMONY Method™, how should the 'Assessment' (A) phase be adapted for a group of 20+ participants to maintain clinical safety?",

                "Assessments should be skipped to save time in a group setting.",
                "Participants should self-diagnose using a general hormone checklist provided in the portal.",
                "Utilize standardized digital screening tools with automated red-flag triggers for 1:1 escalation.",
                "The coach should review every lab result live during the first group call."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To scale safely, coaches must use standardized digital assessments that can flag high-risk symptoms for individual intervention while allowing the rest of the group to proceed with the core curriculum."

            "id": "q34_3",

                "When participants begin implementing dietary changes and experience 'detox' symptoms or resistance to new habits.",
                "After the program ends and they move into the alumni community.",
                "When the group has achieved their weight loss or cycle regulation goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Storming phase occurs as the 'honeymoon period' ends and participants face the reality of lifestyle changes or physical discomfort, requiring the coach to facilitate through the resistance."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "A 2023 study on group health coaching (n=1,200) indicated that 'Social Facilitation' increased protocol adherence by what percentage compared to solo coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 12%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 35%",
                "Social Facilitation actually decreased adherence due to 'Groupthink'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that group dynamics and social facilitation (the tendency to perform better when in the presence of others) increase adherence by roughly 35% in health-related habit formation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adult learning theory (Andragogy) suggests that for high-impact workshops, a 50/50 split ensures participants don't just consume information but actually begin the implementation process (e.g., meal mapping or stress-reduction exercises)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To demonstrate ROI and efficacy, coaches should track the average reduction in symptoms (e.g., using a MSQ - Medical Symptoms Questionnaire) across the cohort to create powerful, data-backed marketing claims."
