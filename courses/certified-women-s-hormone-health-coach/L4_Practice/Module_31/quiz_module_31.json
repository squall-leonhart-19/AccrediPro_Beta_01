            "question": "According to the Strategic Positioning lesson, why is 'niching down' into a specific hormonal pathology (e.g., PCOS or Perimenopause) considered more profitable than general health coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the amount of scientific research the coach needs to perform",
                "It decreases the cost of lead acquisition by increasing perceived specialist authority and allowing for premium pricing",
                "General health coaching is legally restricted in most jurisdictions",
                "It allows the coach to use a single template for every client regardless of bio-individuality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates a 'Category of One' effect. When a coach is perceived as an authority in a specific pathology, the perceived risk for the client decreases, allowing the coach to command higher fees and see higher conversion rates."

            "question": "In the HARMONY Method™ marketing engine, what is the primary role of the 'H' (Hormonal Assessment) phase when used as a lead magnet?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a definitive medical diagnosis to the prospect",
                "To sell supplements immediately before the client joins a program",
                "To provide immediate cognitive 'Aha!' moments by linking symptoms to underlying physiological imbalances",
                "To replace the need for a discovery call or consultation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using assessment-based marketing provides the prospect with immediate value and insight into their own health, establishing the coach's expertise and the methodology's efficacy before a sale is even attempted."

            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "A 2023 industry analysis cited in Lesson 4 found that health content containing peer-reviewed citations had what effect on consumer trust levels compared to anecdotal content?",
            "options": [
                "No measurable difference in trust",
                "A 15% increase in engagement but lower sales",
                "A 74% increase in perceived brand authority and higher intent to purchase",
                "A decrease in trust because scientific language is too complex for the average consumer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based content marketing (citing studies and meta-analyses) significantly boosts authority. In a crowded market, scientific rigor acts as a trust-signal that differentiates a professional coach from an influencer."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "In a High-Ticket Funnel Architecture, what is the specific purpose of the 'Application' step following a VSL (Video Sales Letter)?",
            "options": [
                "To collect email addresses for a newsletter",
                "To act as a friction point that filters out uncommitted prospects and pre-qualifies financial/readiness status",
                "To provide the client with their first week of meal plans",
                "To automate the payment process without any human interaction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket coaching requires a high level of client commitment. The application ensures the coach only spends time on calls with prospects who are a good fit, have the resources to invest, and are serious about their health outcomes."

                "Sending a cold email with a generic brochure of services",
                "Presenting a 'Co-Management Model' where the coach handles lifestyle, nutrition, and compliance, freeing up the doctor's time",
                "Telling the doctor that their current hormone replacement protocols are outdated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physicians are often overwhelmed by the time required for lifestyle counseling. By positioning yourself as a support system that improves patient outcomes and compliance, you solve a problem for the doctor, making them more likely to refer."

            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "If a Hormone Coach has a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $500 and a Lifetime Value (LTV) of $3,500, what is the LTV:CAC ratio, and is this considered a healthy scaling metric?",
            "options": [
                "1:7; No, the CAC is too high for a coaching business",
                "7:1; Yes, this is an excellent ratio for scaling (anything above 3:1 is generally healthy)",
                "5:1; Yes, but only if the coach has a low overhead",
                "0.14:1; No, the business is losing money on every client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LTV:CAC ratio of 7:1 is very strong. It means for every $1 spent on marketing, the business generates $7 in revenue over the life of the client, providing ample margin for operations and profit."

                "Analyzing the gap between the client's protein intake and their requirements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gap analysis is a psychological tool used in ethical sales to help the client realize that the 'cost' of staying where they are (symptoms, frustration, health decline) is higher than the investment in the coaching program."

        {
            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Retention, what is the 'Referral Loop' strategy?",

                "Giving clients a discount if they stay in the program for more than 12 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Referral loops are most effective when initiated during 'Peak-State' moments—when the client is most excited about their results. This turns satisfied clients into an organic acquisition channel."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a Menopause Coach, spends $2,000/month on Meta Ads. She generates 40 leads, books 10 calls, and closes 2 clients at $3,000 each. What is her Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)?",

                "5.0x"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ROAS = Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend. In this case, $6,000 revenue / $2,000 spend = 3.0x ROAS."

                "You must have a PhD to cite any scientific study",
                "You must ensure that marketing claims do not promise to 'cure' or 'treat' medical conditions, even when citing studies",
                "You must only use studies that were published in the last 12 months",
                "You must provide the full PDF of every study cited to every prospect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While citing science is powerful for authority, coaches must stay within their scope of practice. Marketing should focus on 'supporting hormonal balance' or 'optimizing wellness' rather than making medical claims of curing disease."
