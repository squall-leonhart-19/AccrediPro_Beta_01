            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Stuck' client is described as experiencing 'Adaptive Thermogenesis.' What is the primary hormonal driver of this metabolic slowing during a prolonged caloric deficit?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Ghrelin and a decrease in Leptin and T3",
                "An increase in Estrogen and a decrease in Cortisol",
                "A decrease in Insulin and an increase in Progesterone",
                "An increase in Testosterone and a decrease in Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis involves a survival-based down-regulation of the thyroid (T3) and a drop in Leptin, which reduces metabolic rate to match the lower energy intake."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Autoimmune-Hormone Interplay' lesson, why do women with Hashimoto's have a higher statistical prevalence of Endometriosis?",
            "options": [
                "Because they both involve low Vitamin C levels",
                "Shared pathways of Th17-mediated inflammation and systemic cytokine dysregulation",
                "Excessive consumption of cruciferous vegetables",
                "Hashimoto's causes an increase in progesterone which feeds endometriosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Both conditions share an underlying immune dysregulation involving Th17 cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, which can exacerbate both thyroid destruction and endometrial lesion growth."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Surgical Menopause (Lesson 3) is characterized by a 'Rapid HPO Axis Disruption.' How does this transition differ from natural menopause regarding androgen levels?",
            "options": [
                "Androgens actually increase in surgical menopause",
                "There is no difference in androgen levels between the two",
                "Surgical menopause results in a 50% drop in testosterone and an abrupt loss of the ovarian androgen contribution",
                "Natural menopause results in a faster drop in androgens than surgical menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike natural menopause where the ovaries continue to produce small amounts of androgens, surgical removal causes an immediate and drastic loss of ovarian testosterone and androstenedione."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client presents with acne and amenorrhea after stopping the pill, but has a fasting insulin of 4 μIU/mL and a normal BMI. Which differential diagnosis from Lesson 4 is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Metabolic PCOS",
                "Post-Pill PCOS",
                "Adrenal Hyperplasia",
                "Hypothalamic Amenorrhea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-Pill PCOS is often a temporary state of androgen rebound following the withdrawal of synthetic hormones, occurring in the absence of metabolic/insulin-driven triggers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the scenario of HA with Concurrent Insulin Resistance is discussed. Why is 'Refeeding' still the priority even if the client has markers of IR?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin resistance is impossible in HA clients",
                "The HPO axis will not resume function if the body perceives energy scarcity, regardless of insulin levels",
                "Sugar is required to make estrogen",
                "Refeeding cured the insulin resistance automatically in 100% of cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy availability is the primary gatekeeper for GnRH pulsatility. If the body is in an energy deficit, the HPO axis remains 'shut down' even if peripheral insulin resistance is present."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which mycotoxin mentioned in Lesson 6 is specifically known for its ability to act as a 'Zearalenone' mimic, binding to estrogen receptors and disrupting the LH surge?",
            "options": [
                "Aflatoxin",
                "Ochratoxin A",
                "Zearalenone (produced by Fusarium)",
                "Chaetomium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zearalenone is a potent mycoestrogen that can bind to estrogen receptors, leading to 'false' signals that disrupt the natural HPO feedback loop and ovulation."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Perimenopausal Rage.' What is the mechanism behind this neurosteroid fluctuation?",
            "options": [
                "Too much GABA causing sedation",
                "Fluctuating Allopregnanolone (ALLO) levels causing paradoxical GABA-A receptor responses",
                "High levels of Oxytocin causing aggression",
                "A total lack of Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, the erratic fluctuations of progesterone and its metabolite ALLO can cause the GABA-A receptor to become desensitized or respond paradoxically, leading to irritability and rage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the 'Advanced Case Synthesis' (Lesson 8), what is the 'Top-Down' priority when dealing with a client with mold, gut dysbiosis, and HPO axis shutdown?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing high-dose DHEA",
                "Immediate intensive exercise to boost metabolism",
                "Nervous system regulation and opening drainage pathways",
                "Aggressive fasting to kill gut bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex, multi-systemic cases, you must first ensure the body is in a 'safe' state (nervous system) and can effectively remove toxins (drainage) before attempting to manipulate hormones."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis cited in Lesson 2 found that women with Endometriosis are how many times more likely to have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis compared to the general population?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times",
                "6.5 times",
                "They are actually less likely",
                "10 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a significant correlation, with some studies showing women with Endometriosis have a 6.5 times higher risk of developing Hashimoto's."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "Which laboratory marker ratio is most helpful in differentiating between HA and PCOS in a lean client?",
            "options": [
                "The AST:ALT ratio",
                "The LH:FSH ratio (High in PCOS, Low/Normal in HA)",
                "The Sodium:Potassium ratio",
                "The Vitamin D:Calcium ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In PCOS, LH is often significantly higher than FSH (e.g., 3:1), whereas in Hypothalamic Amenorrhea, both LH and FSH are typically very low or 'flatlined.'"
