            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "When interpreting a serum thyroid panel, which range best represents the 'Functional' target for TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) in a non-pregnant woman, as opposed to the standard pathological range?",
            "options": [
                "0.45 – 4.5 mIU/L",
                "1.0 – 2.5 mIU/L",
                "3.0 – 5.5 mIU/L",
                "0.1 – 1.0 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While conventional labs use a broad pathological range (approx. 0.45-4.5), functional medicine targets a narrower window of 1.0-2.5 mIU/L for optimal metabolic and hormonal function."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "On a DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) report, a client shows high levels of 4-OH estrogen metabolites and low levels of 2-OH metabolites. What is the primary clinical concern?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient progesterone production",
                "Rapid clearance of estrogen leading to deficiency",
                "Increased risk of DNA damage and oxidative stress via quinone formation",
                "Excessive androgen conversion to DHT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 4-OH pathway is considered the 'genotoxic' pathway; high levels are associated with DNA adducts and increased risk of estrogen-sensitive tissues' cellular damage if methylation (COMT) is insufficient."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client's Salivary Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) shows a 10% increase from the waking sample to the 30-minute post-waking sample. How should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "A robust and healthy HPA-axis response",
                "A 'blunted' CAR, suggesting chronic HPA-axis dysfunction or 'burnout'",
                "An 'exaggerated' CAR, indicating acute high-stress levels",
                "A normal diurnal rhythm that requires no intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR should see a 50-75% rise in cortisol within the first 30 minutes of waking. A 10% rise is considered blunted, indicating poor HPA-axis resiliency."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In a GI-MAP analysis, an elevated level of Beta-glucuronidase (e.g., >2500 U/mL) specifically impacts the 'Estrobolome' by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the excretion of estrogen through the stool",
                "Deconjugating estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into systemic circulation",
                "Blocking the conversion of T4 to T3 in the gut",
                "Directly stimulating the ovaries to produce more testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme that 'un-couples' estrogen from its glucuronic acid carrier, leading to the reabsorption of estrogen into the bloodstream, contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score is typically used as the threshold for 'optimal' insulin sensitivity in functional hormone coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 1.5",
                "Between 2.5 and 3.0",
                "Greater than 5.0",
                "Exactly 4.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While clinical insulin resistance is often diagnosed at higher levels, a functional HOMA-IR (Glucose x Insulin / 405) of <1.5 indicates optimal insulin sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During Advanced Clinical Interviewing, a client reports 'cyclic' chin acne and hirsutism. Which pathway on a DUTCH test should the coach prioritize investigating?",
            "options": [
                "The 16-OH Estrogen pathway",
                "The 5-alpha reductase pathway (Androgen metabolism)",
                "The Melatonin (6-OHMS) pathway",
                "The Cortisone to Cortisol conversion ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-alpha reductase pathway converts testosterone into DHT (Dihydrotestosterone), which is 3-5x more potent and is the primary driver of androgenic symptoms like cystic acne and hirsutism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client presents with high Reverse T3 (rT3) while her Free T3 is at the low end of the functional range. This 'metabolic braking' is most commonly caused by:",
            "options": [
                "Iodine toxicity",
                "Excessive cardiovascular exercise and chronic caloric restriction",
                "High intake of cruciferous vegetables",
                "Vitamin D deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 acts as a 'brake' on metabolism. It is frequently elevated during periods of physiological stress, such as extreme dieting, overtraining, or chronic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the HARMONY Assessment Roadmap, why is 'Nutrient Screening' (Lesson L7) considered foundational before aggressive hormone replacement or herbal intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrients like Zinc and Magnesium are necessary co-factors for hormone synthesis and receptor sensitivity",
                "Nutrients are only used to mask symptoms of low estrogen",
                "Nutrient screening is only necessary if the client is vegan",
                "It is a legal requirement for all health coaches"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Without adequate co-factors (e.g., Zinc for testosterone/progesterone, Magnesium for COMT/methylation), hormonal pathways cannot function optimally regardless of other interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "When reviewing a serum panel, a Ferritin level of 20 ng/mL in a woman complaining of hair loss and fatigue is:",
            "options": [
                "Perfectly normal as it falls within the standard lab range (15-150 ng/mL)",
                "Pathologically high, indicating iron overload",
                "Functionally low, as hair follicles and thyroid function typically require levels >70 ng/mL",
                "Only relevant if the client is also pregnant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard lab ranges for Ferritin are very broad. Functionally, levels below 50-70 ng/mL are often associated with hair thinning and sub-optimal thyroid hormone utilization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "The 'Synthesis' phase of the HARMONY Roadmap (L8) suggests that if both Adrenal (A) and Ovarian (O) markers are dysregulated, the coach should generally:",
            "options": [
                "Address the Ovarian (O) markers first with bioidentical hormones",
                "Address the Adrenal (A) and Autonomic system first to stabilize the foundation",
                "Ignore the labs and focus only on Environmental Toxins (L7)",
                "Wait 6 months before taking any action"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HARMONY framework prioritizes the 'upstream' drivers. Stabilizing the HPA-axis (Adrenals) is often necessary before the HPO-axis (Ovaries) can achieve long-term balance."
