            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Clinical Reasoning' (L1), why is 'Green Allopathy' considered an inferior approach to professional hormone coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It uses synthetic hormones instead of natural supplements.",
                "It focuses on replacing a pharmaceutical with a supplement to suppress symptoms rather than addressing the underlying physiological dysfunction.",
                "It requires a medical degree to practice, whereas coaching does not.",
                "It relies too heavily on blood testing rather than subjective client feedback."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Green Allopathy is the practice of simply swapping a drug for a herb (e.g., using Vitex like a progesterone pill) without investigating why the hormone was low in the first place, failing to address the root cause."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "According to the HARMONY Method™ Sequencing (L2), which phase must typically be stabilized before addressing 'N' (Neuro-endocrine) or 'O' (Organ/Gut) interventions?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Y' phase (Yielding/Resilience)",
                "The 'M' phase (Metabolic Health)",
                "The 'A' phase (Autonomic/Adrenal Balance)",
                "The 'R' phase (Rhythm/Circadian)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'A' phase (Autonomic/Adrenal) is prioritized early because a chronic sympathetic state (stress response) inhibits digestion (O) and disrupts the HPA-Ovarian axis (N). Stabilizing the stress response is foundational."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 details nutritional programming for PCOS. What specific 'Metabolic Switch' strategy is recommended for clients with high fasting insulin (>12 μIU/mL)?",
            "options": [
                "A high-carb, low-fat vegan diet to improve insulin sensitivity.",
                "A 16:8 intermittent fasting window combined with a 40/30/30 (Carb/Protein/Fat) macro ratio.",
                "Increasing caloric intake by 25% to stimulate the thyroid.",
                "Eliminating all fats to prevent lipid-induced insulin resistance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For insulin-resistant PCOS, a 16:8 fasting window and a balanced macro ratio (40/30/30) help lower basal insulin levels and improve glucose disposal compared to high-carb approaches."

                "Only administered during the follicular phase."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies (e.g., Unfer et al., 2017) demonstrate that 2,000mg to 4,000mg (2-4g) of Myo-inositol per day is the effective range for improving oocyte quality and insulin sensitivity."

            "question": "Regarding Circadian Interventions (L5), a 2022 study showed that 30 minutes of bright morning sunlight (10,000 lux) had what effect on the evening hormonal profile?",
            "options": [
                "It decreased evening cortisol by 15%.",
                "It increased the onset of melatonin secretion by approximately 1.5 hours.",
                "It suppressed progesterone production in the luteal phase.",
                "It had no measurable effect on hormonal timing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Morning light exposure anchors the circadian clock, leading to an earlier and more robust melatonin release in the evening, which is critical for sleep quality and hormonal repair."

                "It prevents hypoglycemic 'emergency' cortisol spikes between meals.",
                "It allows the client to exercise for 3+ hours without any stress response.",
                "It permanently lowers DHEA levels to save energy.",
                "It eliminates the need for the adrenal glands to produce aldosterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility—the ability to switch between burning glucose and fats—prevents the blood sugar drops that force the adrenals to secrete cortisol (gluconeogenesis) to stabilize glucose."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "A client presents with a Metabolic Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) score of 85 and a waking body temperature of 96.4°F. According to Lesson 7, what is the first adjustment needed?",

                "Reducing caloric intake to 1,200 calories to jumpstart weight loss."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An MSQ >50 and low basal body temperature (<97.3°F) suggest systemic inflammation and low metabolic rate. The coach should focus on 'H' (Homeostasis) and thyroid-supportive nutrients before adding metabolic stress."

            "id": "q21_8",

            "options": [
                "To keep the client on supplements indefinitely.",
                "To achieve 'Hormetic Flexibility,' where the client can handle occasional stressors without a total hormonal collapse.",
                "To ensure the client never eats sugar or caffeine again.",
                "To transition the client into a medical-only treatment plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Y' phase is about building resilience (Anti-fragility). A successful protocol ends with a client who is robust enough to handle the 'stresses of life' without losing their hormonal balance."

            "question": "Case Study: 'Elena' (Age 29) has high androgens, cystic acne, and a 45-day cycle. You implement the HARMONY Method. After 90 days, her cycle is 31 days but acne persists. What does Lesson 7 suggest?",

                "The protocol failed; refer to a dermatologist immediately.",
                "Continue the current protocol for another 90 days, as skin turnover and sebum changes often lag behind cycle regulation.",
                "Double the dose of all supplements to force a change.",
                "Switch to the 'O' phase (Organ/Gut) to check for liver detoxification issues affecting androgen clearance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "If the cycle has regulated (N/R phases working) but skin issues (androgen clearance) persist, the coach should look at the 'O' phase—specifically liver and gut clearance of metabolites."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional protocol design focuses on the Minimum Effective Dose (MED) to minimize side effects, reduce client cost, and ensure better compliance (avoiding 'pill fatigue')."
