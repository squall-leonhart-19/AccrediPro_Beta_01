            "question": "In the hierarchy of evidence-based practice (EBP) discussed in Lesson 1, which type of study provides the highest level of clinical certainty for hormone health interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Expert consensus reports and clinical anecdotes",
                "Case-control studies and retrospective cohorts",
                "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)",
                "Animal-based mechanistic studies on endocrine disruptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses sit at the top of the evidence pyramid as they synthesize data from multiple high-quality RCTs, reducing bias and increasing statistical power."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis regarding the estrobolome (Lesson 3) highlighted the role of beta-glucuronidase. What is the clinical significance of elevated levels of this enzyme?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the excretion of estrogen through the urea cycle",
                "It deconjugates estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation",
                "It prevents the binding of xenoestrogens to the ER-alpha receptor",
                "It accelerates the Phase II methylation of 2-OH estrogens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, leading to the reabsorption of 'active' estrogen into the bloodstream, potentially contributing to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "When critically appraising research on the Menstrual Cycle (Lesson 2), why is 'p < 0.05' often considered insufficient on its own for clinical application?",
            "options": [
                "It only indicates statistical significance, not clinical relevance or effect size",
                "It suggests the study had a 50% margin of error",
                "It means the sample size was too small to be valid",
                "It indicates that the researchers used a qualitative rather than quantitative approach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A p-value measures the probability that results occurred by chance. It does not describe the magnitude of the effect (effect size) or whether the change is meaningful to the client's quality of life (clinical relevance)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitex contains diterpenes that bind to dopamine D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary, inhibiting the release of prolactin, which in turn supports the corpus luteum and progesterone production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges vary, a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score above 1.9 to 2.0 is frequently cited in clinical research as a marker for insulin resistance in women."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 explores Circadian Biology. What does the 'Cortisol Awakening Response' (CAR) specifically represent in clinical HPA axis research?",
            "options": [
                "The total amount of cortisol produced in a 24-hour period",
                "The sharp 50-160% increase in cortisol levels within 30-45 minutes of waking",

                "The ratio of cortisol to DHEA measured during the luteal phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR is a distinct part of the circadian rhythm where cortisol rises significantly upon waking, reflecting the HPA axis's reactivity and 'anticipatory' stress response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical evidence shows that diets high in omega-3s, antioxidants, and fiber (like the Mediterranean diet) can lower PGE2 and oxidative stress, which are key drivers of endometriosis-related pain."
