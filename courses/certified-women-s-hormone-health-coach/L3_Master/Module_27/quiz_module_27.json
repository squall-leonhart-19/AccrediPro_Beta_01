            "question": "According to the 'Triad of Autoimmunity' discussed in Lesson 1, which three factors must be present for an autoimmune condition to manifest and persist?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic predisposition, intestinal permeability, and an environmental trigger",
                "High estrogen, low progesterone, and chronic stress",
                "Viral load, heavy metal toxicity, and nutrient deficiency",
                "Hypothyroidism, adrenal fatigue, and insulin resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Based on Dr. Alessio Fasano's research, autoimmunity requires a genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger (antigen), and increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) to allow the trigger to interact with the immune system."

            "question": "In the context of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), what is the critical threshold of energy availability (EA) below which physiological functions like menstruation and bone health are significantly impaired?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "20 kcal/kg of total body weight per day",
                "15 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that an energy availability (EA) below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day is the threshold where the body begins to downregulate metabolic and reproductive processes to conserve energy."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "PMDD is characterized not by a deficiency in progesterone, but by a maladaptive response to which progesterone metabolite at the GABA-A receptor?",
            "options": [
                "Pregnenolone",
                "17-OH Progesterone",
                "Allopregnanolone",
                "Androstenedione"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) is driven by a neurobiological sensitivity to the fluctuations of allopregnanolone, which normally acts as a calming neurosteroid on GABA-A receptors but causes paradoxical agitation in PMDD patients."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "When managing 'Complex Perimenopause,' why is transdermal estradiol typically preferred over oral estradiol for women with a BMI over 30 or a history of smoking?",
            "options": [
                "Transdermal estradiol is more effective at stopping hot flashes",
                "Transdermal estradiol bypasses the first-pass hepatic metabolism, reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)",
                "Oral estradiol causes significant weight gain in the luteal phase",
                "Transdermal estradiol is the only form that supports bone mineral density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oral estrogen increases the production of clotting factors in the liver. Transdermal application bypasses the liver, making it a safer option for patients with higher cardiovascular or clot risks."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A client presents with hirsutism and irregular cycles, but her ultrasound shows normal ovaries and her insulin sensitivity is high. Which PCOS phenotype does she likely represent under the Rotterdam Criteria?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A (Full PCOS)",
                "Phenotype B (Non-Polycystic PCOS)",
                "Phenotype C (Ovulatory PCOS)",
                "Phenotype D (Non-Androgenic PCOS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phenotype B (Non-Polycystic) includes hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction but lacks the polycystic morphology on an ultrasound."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Which Phase II detoxification pathway is most critical for the clearance of Bisphenol A (BPA) and is often supported by calcium-d-glucarate?",
            "options": [
                "Sulfation",
                "Methylation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Acetylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BPA is primarily detoxified through glucuronidation. Calcium-d-glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that can 'un-couple' detoxified toxins in the gut, allowing them to be reabsorbed."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In IVF support protocols, why is Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) commonly supplemented at high doses (e.g., 600mg+) for women with Diminished Ovarian Reserve (DOR)?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the thickness of the endometrial lining",
                "To suppress FSH levels during the stimulation phase",
                "To improve mitochondrial ATP production in the oocyte and reduce meiotic errors",
                "To prevent the development of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oocytes have the highest concentration of mitochondria in the body. CoQ10 supports mitochondrial function, which is essential for the energy-intensive process of chromosomal alignment and division in the egg."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "A client recovering from ER+ Breast Cancer is prescribed an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI). What is a primary hormonal side effect that a coach must address regarding musculoskeletal health?",

                "Increased risk of blood clots",
                "Significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD) due to near-total estrogen suppression",
                "Excessive muscle hypertrophy",
                "High levels of circulating testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aromatase Inhibitors block the conversion of androgens to estrogens in all tissues, leading to extremely low estrogen levels which can rapidly accelerate bone loss and cause joint pain (arthralgia)."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "How can a practitioner clinically differentiate between Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA) and PCOS in a lean athlete with amenorrhea?",
            "options": [
                "FHA typically presents with high LH, while PCOS presents with low LH",
                "FHA typically presents with low LH and low leptin, while PCOS presents with high LH and often higher insulin",
                "FHA has no impact on bone density, whereas PCOS causes osteoporosis",
                "There is no clinical way to differentiate the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FHA is a state of energy conservation characterized by low Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and low leptin. PCOS usually presents with an elevated LH:FSH ratio and androgen excess."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis for HRT, when is the safest and most effective time to initiate hormone therapy to provide cardioprotective benefits?",

                "Only if the woman has never experienced hot flashes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis suggests that HRT has cardiovascular benefits when started before the progression of atherosclerosis, typically within 10 years of menopause or before age 60."
