            "question": "A client with diagnosed PMDD presents with sudden worsening of symptoms and mentions feeling 'hopeless' and 'trapped' by her cycle. What is the immediate triage priority for a Hormone Health Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Suggesting a higher dose of Vitex or Calcium",
                "Assessing for active suicidal ideation and implementing a safety plan/referral",
                "Recommending an immediate DUTCH test to check progesterone levels",
                "Encouraging a gluten-free diet to reduce neuro-inflammation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In severe PMDD cases, mental health safety is the primary triage priority. If a client expresses hopelessness, the coach must assess for self-harm risk and refer to a licensed mental health professional or emergency services immediately."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Treatment-Resistant PCOS,' what clinical finding would most likely classify a case as a 'Metabolic Crisis' requiring medical co-management?",
            "options": [
                "A fasting insulin level of 12 mIU/L",
                "Mild hirsutism on the chin and upper lip",
                "HbA1c levels exceeding 6.5% alongside persistent hypertension",
                "Irregular cycles occurring every 35 to 40 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is the diagnostic threshold for Type 2 Diabetes. When combined with hypertension, this constitutes a metabolic crisis that exceeds the scope of health coaching and requires medical intervention."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Research indicates a significant intersection between Endometriosis and Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. Which immunological mechanism is thought to drive this 'Autoimmune Intersection'?",
            "options": [
                "Low levels of cortisol stimulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies",
                "A Th1/Th2 imbalance where Th1 dominance triggers systemic inflammation and cross-reactivity",
                "Excessive progesterone causing the thyroid to slow down",
                "A lack of Vitamin D causing the endometrial lining to migrate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis and Hashimoto's both involve immune dysregulation. A shift in the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance leads to a pro-inflammatory state that can exacerbate both the autoimmune attack on the thyroid and the inflammatory proliferation of endometrial tissue."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "During Stage 3 HPA Axis Collapse (Adrenal Burnout), what is the characteristic 'Diurnal Cortisol' pattern observed in salivary testing?",

                "Extremely high morning cortisol with a sharp drop at noon",
                "A 'wired but tired' pattern with low morning and high night cortisol",
                "A 'flat-lined' pattern with low cortisol output throughout the entire 24-hour period",
                "Normal morning cortisol but elevated DHEA levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 3 HPA Axis Collapse is characterized by 'hypocortisolism,' where the body can no longer maintain a normal rhythm, resulting in a flat-lined pattern of low cortisol throughout the day."

            "question": "A client recovering from ER+ Breast Cancer is experiencing severe vaginal atrophy and hot flashes due to Aromatase Inhibitors. Which intervention is WITHIN the scope of a Hormone Coach?",

                "Advising the client to stop their medication due to side effects",
                "Prescribing DHEA supplements to boost libido"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches cannot prescribe or recommend hormones like Estriol or DHEA to cancer survivors. They can, however, suggest evidence-based herbal supports like Black Cohosh (if cleared by their oncologist) and lifestyle strategies for symptom management."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between PMDD and Premenstrual Exacerbation (PME) in a clinical triage setting?",
            "options": [
                "PMDD only involves physical symptoms, while PME is purely psychological",
                "PMDD symptoms disappear during the follicular phase, whereas PME is the worsening of an underlying disorder that persists all month",
                "PME is treated with progesterone, while PMDD is treated with estrogen",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'symptom-free' week (follicular phase) is the hallmark of PMDD. In PME, the client has an underlying condition (like MDD or GAD) that exists throughout the cycle but becomes significantly worse during the luteal phase."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In cases of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL), 'Progesterone Resistance' at the cellular level is often suspected. What does this mean for the coach's approach?",
            "options": [
                "The client needs to take 10x the normal dose of progesterone",
                "The coach should focus on reducing systemic inflammation and improving receptor sensitivity rather than just 'adding more' hormone",
                "The client should avoid all fats to prevent progesterone buildup",
                "Progesterone resistance is not a valid clinical concept"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone resistance occurs when receptors do not respond effectively to the hormone, often due to inflammation or oxidative stress. The coach's role is to support the biological terrain to improve receptor function."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Red Flag' symptom in a complex case that requires an immediate referral to a specialist (Neurologist or ER)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thunderclap headaches or vision loss are neurological red flags that could indicate serious conditions like a pituitary tumor or stroke, requiring immediate medical evaluation."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "When managing a 'Circle of Care' for a complex client, what is the most professional way to communicate with their physician?",
            "options": [
                "Sending a 10-page handwritten letter about the client's emotions",
                "Asking the client to tell the doctor what the coach said",

                "Calling the doctor's office and demanding they change the client's prescription"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional collaboration requires concise, objective, and data-driven communication. Providing a summary of symptoms and specific data points (like BBT charts or food logs) helps the physician make better clinical decisions."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A client presents with Hashimoto's, Endometriosis, and Stage 3 HPA Collapse. According to the module's hierarchy of intervention, what should be the first area of focus?",

                "Aggressive HIIT exercise to lose weight",
                "Strict iodine supplementation to 'fix' the thyroid",

                "Surgical removal of the uterus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex, multi-system cases, you must stabilize the foundations first. Addressing the HPA axis and reducing systemic inflammation provides the necessary environment for thyroid and reproductive health to eventually improve."
