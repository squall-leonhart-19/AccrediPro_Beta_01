            "question": "In the H.A.R.M.O.N.Y.™ Framework, what does the 'A' phase primarily focus on to ensure successful long-term outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Advanced supplementation protocols for immediate symptom relief",
                "Assessment of Ancestry, Epigenetic Triggers, and Allostatic Load",
                "Aerobic exercise prescription to balance the HPA axis",
                "Analysis of monthly menstrual cycle fluctuations only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' phase (Assessment/Ancestry) focuses on the root causes, including epigenetic triggers and the client's total allostatic load, rather than just surface symptoms or exercise."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When correlating lab markers with biofeedback, a client presents with 'High' serum cortisol but reports 'Extreme Fatigue' and low morning energy. According to Lesson 2, what is the most likely clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "The lab results are likely an error and should be discarded",
                "The client has high total cortisol but low free (bioavailable) cortisol or poor receptor sensitivity",
                "The client is in the 'Alarm' phase of the H.A.R.M.O.N.Y. framework and needs more caffeine",
                "The client is over-training and needs to increase carbohydrate intake immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master practitioners must distinguish between total hormone levels and bioavailable levels/receptor sensitivity. High total cortisol with low-energy biofeedback often indicates a mismatch in bioavailability or cellular resistance."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3 highlighted that what percentage of hormonal expression is estimated to be influenced by epigenetic factors (lifestyle/environment) rather than fixed genetic SNPs?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Between 70% and 90%",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson emphasizes that while SNPs provide a blueprint, 70-90% of hormonal expression is determined by epigenetic factors, which is why the 'A' phase of the framework is so impactful."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In the Metabolic-Hormonal Nexus (Phases M and N), how does chronic hyperinsulinemia specifically impact the 'N' (Nutrition) phase in perimenopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of estrogen to testosterone",
                "It upregulates SHBG, leading to more free estrogen",
                "It drives theca cell androgen production and downregulates SHBG, exacerbating estrogen dominance",
                "It has no impact on hormonal signaling, only on weight management"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia is a core metabolic disruptor that drives androgen production and lowers Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), which increases the ratio of free, active estrogens."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5 on Chronodisruption, exposure to blue light (460-480nm) for 2 hours before bed can delay melatonin onset by how many minutes on average?",

                "30 minutes",

                "Melatonin is not affected by blue light"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 cites research showing that significant blue light exposure can delay the Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) by approximately 90 minutes, disrupting the entire 'O' (Optimization) phase."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex multi-system cases, stabilizing the foundation (Circadian/Blood Sugar) is required before layering on specific detox or high-intensity protocols to avoid further HPA axis strain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches use functional testing for education and lifestyle customization. Diagnosing, prescribing, or altering medical prescriptions is outside the scope of a Hormone Health Coach."

            "question": "The 'Mastery Integration' protocol suggests that when lab data and biofeedback conflict, the practitioner should prioritize:",
            "options": [
                "The lab data, as it is objective and clinical",
                "The client's biofeedback and subjective experience",
                "Neither; they should order more expensive testing immediately",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A core tenet of the H.A.R.M.O.N.Y.™ framework is 'Treat the person, not the paper.' Biofeedback is the real-time expression of the client's physiology."
