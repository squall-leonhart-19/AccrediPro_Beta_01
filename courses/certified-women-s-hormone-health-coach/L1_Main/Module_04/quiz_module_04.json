            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score of 2.8. Based on Module 4 data, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal metabolic health; no intervention required.",
                "Early signs of insulin sensitivity; focus on increasing carbohydrate intake.",
                "Significant insulin resistance; the client is at increased risk for ovulatory dysfunction.",
                "Clinical Type 2 Diabetes; immediate referral to an endocrinologist is the only step."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An optimal HOMA-IR is typically <1.5. A score of 2.8 indicates significant insulin resistance, which can stimulate theca cells in the ovaries to overproduce androgens, leading to PCOS-like symptoms and ovulatory dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which enzyme, often inhibited by high levels of systemic inflammation and cortisol, is responsible for the conversion of T4 to the metabolically active T3?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "5'-deiodinase",
                "Aromatase",
                "Glutathione Peroxidase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5'-deiodinase enzyme facilitates the conversion of T4 to T3. Stress, inflammation, and nutrient deficiencies (like Selenium) can inhibit this enzyme, leading to 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' or high Reverse T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is discussed. A 'blunted' CAR (less than a 50% increase in cortisol 30 minutes after waking) is most indicative of:",
            "options": [
                "Acute stress response and high adrenal reserve.",
                "Chronic HPA axis dysfunction and potential burnout.",
                "Optimal mitochondrial energy production.",
                "Excessive Phase I liver detoxification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR shows a sharp rise in cortisol upon waking. A blunted response indicates that the HPA axis is no longer responding appropriately to the morning stress signal, often seen in chronic fatigue and long-term stress."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "During the Mid-Luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, how does female physiology typically respond to insulin compared to the Follicular phase?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin sensitivity increases due to high estrogen.",
                "Insulin sensitivity remains identical across all phases.",
                "Insulin sensitivity naturally decreases due to the effects of progesterone.",
                "The body stops producing insulin and relies entirely on glucagon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone, while essential for pregnancy, induces a state of mild insulin resistance in the luteal phase. This is why many women experience increased hunger and different carbohydrate requirements before menstruation."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which nutrient is specifically required for the 'Carnitine Shuttle' to transport long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for Beta-Oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Magnesium Bisglycinate",
                "Coenzyme Q10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L-Carnitine is the primary nutrient responsible for shuttling fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. Without it, the body cannot efficiently burn fat for fuel, compromising metabolic flexibility."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A client's Dutch Test shows high levels of 16-OH estrone but low 2-OH estrone. Which Phase II liver detoxification pathway should the coach prioritize to improve estrogen clearance?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylation",
                "Methylation (via COMT enzyme)",
                "Sulfation",
                "Hydrolysis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) is responsible for the methylation of estrogen metabolites. Supporting methylation helps convert potentially DNA-damaging metabolites into stable, excretable forms."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Metabolic-Hormone Connection,' leptin resistance in the hypothalamus directly suppresses the release of which hormone, leading to secondary amenorrhea?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin",
                "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)",

                "Cholecystokinin (CCK)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin acts as a metabolic gatekeeper. When the brain is leptin-resistant (or leptin is too low), it perceives an energy deficit and shuts down GnRH pulses, which in turn halts LH and FSH production, stopping the menstrual cycle."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "When building a Metabolic Optimization Protocol (Lesson 8), what is the 'Order of Operations' recommended for the best long-term outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "1. Intense Exercise, 2. Caloric Restriction, 3. Hormone Replacement.",
                "1. Blood Sugar Stability, 2. Gut Health/Liver Support, 3. HPA Axis Modulation.",
                "1. Thyroid Medication, 2. High Protein Diet, 3. Liver Detox.",
                "1. Supplementation, 2. Fasting, 3. Stress Management."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol emphasizes stabilizing blood sugar first to reduce systemic inflammation, followed by supporting the organs of elimination (Gut/Liver), and finally addressing the HPA axis to ensure sustainable energy."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Which specific statistic regarding subclinical hypothyroidism was highlighted in Module 4?",
            "options": [
                "It affects only 1% of the female population.",
                "Women are 5-8 times more likely than men to have thyroid issues.",
                "Thyroid issues are strictly genetic and cannot be influenced by diet.",
                "TSH levels of 4.5 mIU/L are considered optimal for conception."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epidemiological data shows women are significantly more prone to thyroid dysfunction (5-8x more than men), largely due to the complex interplay between estrogen and thyroid-binding globulin (TBG)."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (34) complains of 'brain fog,' cold hands, and weight gain despite a low-calorie diet. Her TSH is 3.2 and her fasting glucose is 98 mg/dL. What is the most likely metabolic bottleneck?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive metabolic flexibility.",
                "Subclinical hypothyroidism and poor T4 to T3 conversion.",
                "Acute hypercortisolemia.",
                "Phase III liver clearance overactivity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms (cold hands, weight gain, brain fog) are classic signs of low cellular T3. A TSH of 3.2 is often considered 'normal' by labs but is sub-optimal in functional medicine (optimal is usually 0.5–2.0), suggesting a thyroid-driven metabolic slowdown."
