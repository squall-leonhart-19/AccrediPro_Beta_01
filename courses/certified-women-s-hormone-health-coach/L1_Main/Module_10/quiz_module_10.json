            "question": "During the neurobiological transition of perimenopause, the decline in Allopregnanolone is clinically significant because it acts as a potent positive allosteric modulator of which receptor?",
            "options": [
                "NMDA receptors",
                "GABA-A receptors",
                "Serotonin 5-HT2A receptors",
                "Dopamine D2 receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a metabolite of progesterone that modulates GABA-A receptors. Its decline during perimenopause is a primary driver of increased anxiety, sleep disturbances, and reduced stress resilience."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the 'Estrogen Dominance vs. Progesterone Deficiency' framework of the early 40s, what is the primary physiological cause of the 'relative' estrogen dominance?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in total lifetime estrogen production",
                "A failure of the liver to conjugate estriol",
                "Anovulatory cycles resulting in the absence of a corpus luteum",
                "Upregulation of the aromatase enzyme in visceral fat only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As ovarian reserve declines, cycles often become anovulatory. Without ovulation, no corpus luteum is formed, leading to a precipitous drop in progesterone while estrogen levels may remain high or fluctuate wildly, creating a relative imbalance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "The 'Adrenal-Ovarian Shift' highlights the importance of the Zona Reticularis. Which steroid hormone does this specific adrenal layer produce to serve as a precursor for peripheral estrogen conversion post-menopause?",
            "options": [
                "Aldosterone",
                "Cortisol",
                "DHEA/DHEA-S",
                "Progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Zona Reticularis produces DHEA and DHEA-S. In post-menopausal women, these adrenal androgens are converted into estrone (E1) via aromatase in peripheral tissues, making adrenal health vital for hormonal stability after ovarian failure."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to the Module 10 data on metabolic resilience, the loss of estradiol post-45 specifically impairs which cellular process in skeletal muscle?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase production",
                "GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane",
                "Gluconeogenesis in the mitochondria",
                "Glycogen storage in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol plays a critical role in insulin sensitivity by facilitating the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane. Its loss leads to increased insulin resistance even in the absence of dietary changes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "How does the perimenopausal rise in Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), often triggered by fluctuating estrogen, impact thyroid function markers?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the bioavailability of Free T3",
                "It binds to TSH receptors, mimicking hyperthyroidism",
                "It can bind thyroid hormones, potentially lowering Free T3 and Free T4 levels",
                "It has no measurable effect on thyroid markers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High levels of estrogen (or oral ERT) can increase SHBG and Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). This increases the bound fraction of thyroid hormones, potentially leaving less 'Free' (active) hormone available for tissues, mimicking hypothyroid symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis for cardiovascular protection suggests that Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has the most favorable benefit-risk ratio when started:",
            "options": [
                "At least 20 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only after the age of 70",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "Strictly during the pre-menopause phase (age 35-40)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that starting HRT within the 'window' (within 10 years of menopause) supports vascular endothelium health, whereas starting it much later may pose risks if atherosclerosis is already established."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Research into cognitive longevity (Lesson 7) indicates that the menopausal brain undergoes a 'bioenergetic crisis.' What is the specific percentage drop in brain glucose metabolism often observed during this transition?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-25%",
                "40-50%",
                "The brain's glucose metabolism actually increases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Imaging studies (such as those by Mosconi et al.) show a 15-25% decline in brain glucose metabolism during the transition, which correlates with 'brain fog' and may trigger a shift toward ketone utilization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah' (47), who presents with 'wired but tired' energy and heavy periods, why is supporting the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (HPA axis) prioritized over direct estrogen suppression?",
            "options": [
                "Because estrogen is neuroprotective and should never be lowered",
                "Because high cortisol diverts precursors away from progesterone, worsening the imbalance",
                "Because Sarah's symptoms are caused by low cortisol, not high estrogen",
                "Because the HPA axis controls the release of FSH directly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress causes the HPA axis to prioritize cortisol production. This can lead to a relative progesterone deficiency (as they share the precursor pregnenolone), which exacerbates the symptoms of estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "What is the average rate of bone mineral density (BMD) loss during the first five years of the menopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% per year",
                "1-2% total over five years",
                "Up to 10-12% total (approx. 2% per year)",
                "Bone density remains stable until age 75"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Women can lose up to 10-12% of their bone mass in the first five years following menopause due to the rapid decline in estrogen, which normally inhibits osteoclast (bone-resorbing) activity."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which nutritional strategy is most effective for maintaining 'Metabolic Resilience' post-45 by targeting the age-related decline in muscle protein synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Intermittent fasting with a 20:4 window",
                "Increasing protein bolus intake to 30-40g per meal (Leucine threshold)",
                "A low-protein, high-carbohydrate vegan diet",
                "Reducing caloric intake to under 1,200 calories per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anabolic resistance increases with age and declining estrogen. To stimulate muscle protein synthesis, older women require a higher 'Leucine threshold' (roughly 2.5-3g of Leucine or 30-40g of total high-quality protein) per meal compared to younger women."
