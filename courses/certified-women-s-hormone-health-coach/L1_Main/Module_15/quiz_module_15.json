        {
            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Which molecule acts as the primary 'gatekeeper' of the reproductive axis by stimulating GnRH neurons in response to metabolic signals like leptin?",
            "options": [
                "Kisspeptin",
                "Ghrelin",
                "Somatostatin",
                "Prolactin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Kisspeptin, produced in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei, is the essential upstream regulator of GnRH. It integrates metabolic signals (like leptin) to ensure the body has sufficient energy stores for reproduction."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In 'Phenotype C' (Ovulatory PCOS), which of the following clinical presentations is most characteristic according to the Rotterdam Criteria?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperandrogenism and Polycystic Ovarian Morphology (PCOM) with regular ovulation",
                "Hyperandrogenism and Chronic Anovulation without PCOM",
                "Chronic Anovulation and PCOM without clinical hyperandrogenism",
                "Insulin resistance and obesity without androgen elevation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phenotype C, or 'Ovulatory PCOS,' involves hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) and PCOM, but the patient continues to ovulate, often making it harder to diagnose than classic phenotypes."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Endometriotic lesions are unique in their ability to produce their own estrogen. Which enzyme is pathologically overexpressed within these lesions?",
            "options": [
                "5-alpha reductase",
                "Aromatase",
                "17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2",
                "COMT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike normal endometrium, endometriotic tissue expresses high levels of aromatase, which converts androgens into estradiol locally, fueling the growth of the lesion regardless of systemic hormone levels."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which a dysbiotic estrobolome increases systemic estrogen levels?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'unclips' the glucuronic acid from conjugated estrogen, allowing the free estrogen to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream via enterohepatic circulation."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "In the Thyroid-Adrenal-Ovarian (TAO) axis cross-talk, how does chronic hypercortisolemia typically affect thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, increasing Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "It increases the sensitivity of TSH receptors in the thyroid gland",
                "It lowers the production of Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol inhibit the conversion of T4 to the active T3 and instead promote the production of Reverse T3, an inactive isomer that competes for receptor sites, leading to 'cellular hypothyroidism.'"

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which concept describes how environmental endocrine disruptors (EDCs) can affect the health of future generations without altering the DNA sequence itself?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs can cause epigenetic changes (like DNA methylation or histone modification) in germ cells that are passed down to offspring, potentially affecting the health of the F3 generation (great-grandchildren)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent neurosteroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors. Rapid fluctuations during perimenopause contribute to increased anxiety, insomnia, and mood instability."

            "id": "q15_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LPS from gut bacteria can enter systemic circulation and the pelvic cavity, where they bind to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), driving the inflammatory cascade that allows endometriotic lesions to adhere and proliferate."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In the HARMONY Method™, when addressing a client with both PCOS and severe HPA axis dysfunction, which system is typically prioritized for stabilization first?",
            "options": [
                "The Ovarian system (Direct androgen suppression)",
                "The Adrenal/Nervous system (Nervous system regulation)",
                "The Hepatic system (Aggressive detoxification)",
                "The Renal system (Fluid balance)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HARMONY Method™ prioritizes the 'foundation' systems. Since the HPA axis (Adrenal) influences insulin sensitivity and androgen production (via DHEAS), stabilizing the nervous system is essential before the ovarian hormones can balance."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which EDC is specifically classified as an 'obesogen' due to its ability to activate PPAR-gamma and increase the number of adipocytes (fat cells)?",

                "Phthalates",
                "Tributyltin (TBT)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tributyltin (TBT) is a well-studied obesogen that activates the PPAR-gamma receptor, effectively 'programming' stem cells to become fat cells rather than bone or muscle cells."
