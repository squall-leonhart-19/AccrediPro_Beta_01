            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Sustainability' (L1), what is the primary clinical difference between the Intervention Phase and the Maintenance Phase?",
            "options": [
                "Intervention focuses on symptom suppression, while maintenance focuses on root cause resolution.",
                "Intervention uses therapeutic dosages to shift physiology, while maintenance uses the minimum effective dose to preserve homeostasis.",
                "Intervention is always 12 weeks, while maintenance is indefinitely 6 months.",
                "Intervention requires 100% compliance, while maintenance allows for 50/50 flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Intervention Phase utilizes higher-intensity protocols and therapeutic dosages to correct imbalances, whereas Maintenance aims for the 'Minimum Effective Dose' (MED) to sustain those results with less metabolic and psychological effort."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to the concept of Allostatic Load (L2), which physiological state describes the 'wear and tear' on the body from chronic over-activation of the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "Allostatic Balance",
                "Homeostatic Drift",
                "Allostatic Overload",
                "Metabolic Adaptation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allostatic Overload occurs when the cumulative cost of adapting to chronic stress exceeds the body's ability to recover, leading to hormonal dysregulation and systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When applying 'Advanced Cycle Syncing' (L3) to a high-stress modern lifestyle, how should a client's caloric intake typically change during the mid-to-late luteal phase?",
            "options": [
                "Increase by 100-300 calories to account for a 2.5-10% increase in Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).",
                "Decrease by 200 calories to compensate for lower insulin sensitivity.",
                "Maintain strict caloric deficits to prevent progesterone-induced water retention.",
                "Fast for 16 hours daily to manage the rise in core body temperature."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that BMR increases by approximately 2.5% to 10% during the luteal phase due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone, requiring a slight increase in caloric intake to maintain hormonal stability."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, navigating the transition into perimenopause requires a shift in focus. Which hormonal trend is most characteristic of early perimenopause?",
            "options": [
                "Consistently low estrogen and high progesterone.",
                "Stable LH levels with a complete cessation of FSH production.",
                "Erratic estrogen spikes coupled with a progressive decline in progesterone.",
                "A linear decline in all sex hormones starting at age 35."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Early perimenopause is defined by 'hormonal chaos,' characterized by fluctuating, often high, estrogen levels (estrogen dominance) and a shortening of the luteal phase, leading to lower progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A client's biofeedback (L5) shows a consistent 15% drop in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and a 0.5°F rise in Basal Body Temperature (BBT) during her follicular phase. What does this likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Successful ovulation has occurred early.",
                "The client is entering a state of high allostatic load or impending illness.",
                "The client is in the 'Fat Burning Zone' of her cycle.",
                "A normal response to increased estrogen levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV combined with a rise in BBT during the follicular phase (when temp should be low) is a primary biofeedback red flag for systemic stress, overtraining, or the onset of an immune response."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "The '80/20 Rule' (L6) is used to prevent which psychological condition often associated with strict hormonal dieting?",

                "Bulimia Nervosa"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule promotes 'Food Freedom' and social integration to prevent Orthorexia—an unhealthy obsession with eating only 'pure' or 'correct' foods that can ironically increase stress and disrupt hormones."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "During seasonal adjustments (L7), why is 'Morning Sunlight Exposure' critical for hormonal sustainability in the winter months?",
            "options": [
                "It directly increases progesterone production in the skin.",
                "It anchors the circadian rhythm, regulating the cortisol-melatonin switch for better sleep quality.",
                "It prevents the 'Winter Stall' by increasing thyroid T3 conversion by 40%.",
                "It is the only way to maintain Vitamin D levels above 50 ng/mL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Morning light exposure (photobiomodulation) suppresses melatonin and triggers the timely release of cortisol, which ensures the circadian clock remains synchronized, vital for overall endocrine health."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "The 'Graduation Protocol' (L8) defines 'Client Autonomy' as the ability to:",

                "Follow a provided meal plan for the rest of their life without changes.",

                "Interpret complex blood chemistry without the need for a physician.",
                "Achieve a state where hormones never fluctuate regardless of lifestyle stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True autonomy means the client has the education and self-awareness to recognize early warning signs (red flags) and knows which specific interventions to re-apply to maintain their results."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (44) is in perimenopause. She experiences increased anxiety and sleep disturbances. Based on Lesson 4, which intervention is most sustainable for her maintenance plan?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing HIIT sessions to 5 times per week to burn off cortisol.",
                "A strict ketogenic diet to suppress estrogen fluctuations.",
                "Prioritizing heavy strength training and increasing magnesium/L-theanine intake.",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates to prevent insulin resistance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For perimenopausal clients, maintaining muscle mass through strength training and supporting the nervous system with targeted minerals/amino acids is more sustainable and effective than high-intensity cardio or restrictive dieting."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding maintenance found that clients who utilized 'Biofeedback Monitoring' (L5) had what percentage higher success rate in long-term weight and hormone maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "25%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As noted in the data-table sections, meta-analyses (n=8,234) show that biofeedback-informed maintenance leads to a 42% higher success rate compared to those who follow static, non-monitored plans."
