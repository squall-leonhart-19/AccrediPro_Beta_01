            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which hormone, released from the hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner, serves as the primary 'pacemaker' for the HPO axis?",
            "options": [
                "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Kisspeptin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GnRH is the master signaling hormone released by the hypothalamus; its pulse frequency determines whether the pituitary releases FSH (slow pulses) or LH (fast pulses)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In the context of the Estrogen-Progesterone synergy, how does Progesterone primarily modulate the effects of Estrogen on uterine tissue?",
            "options": [
                "By upregulating Estrogen receptors to increase sensitivity",
                "By inhibiting the production of Estrogen in the ovaries",
                "By downregulating Estrogen receptors and activating 17β-HSD to convert estradiol to estrone",
                "By increasing the binding affinity of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone acts as a natural antagonist to estrogen's proliferative effects by downregulating estrogen receptors and promoting the conversion of potent estradiol into the weaker estrone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis (stress response) can lead to 'Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea' primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol directly destroying the ovarian follicles",
                "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) inhibiting the GnRH pulse generator",
                "Excessive adrenaline increasing the rate of estrogen clearance",
                "Cortisol increasing the conversion of progesterone into testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of CRH and cortisol exert an inhibitory effect on the GnRH pulse generator in the hypothalamus, which halts the signaling required for ovulation."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a 24-day cycle and consistent spotting starting on day 21. Based on Lesson 4, what is the most likely clinical suspicion?",
            "options": [
                "Follicular phase arrest",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Premenstrual spotting and a short cycle (less than 10-12 days of luteal flow) are classic indicators of Luteal Phase Deficiency and insufficient progesterone production by the corpus luteum."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to the statistics provided in Lesson 6, what percentage of women with PCOS exhibit some degree of insulin resistance, regardless of their Body Mass Index (BMI)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Only those with a BMI over 30"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 70-80% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance, highlighting that it is a primary driver of the condition even in 'lean' PCOS phenotypes."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a collection of enteric bacteria capable of producing which enzyme that can lead to the reabsorption of estrogen into circulation?",

                "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-couples' conjugated estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream instead of being excreted."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "During the Follicular Phase, which nutrient is specifically emphasized for supporting the 'FSH-to-Estrogen' transition and healthy follicle development?",
            "options": [
                "Vitex Agnus-Castus",
                "Zinc and Vitamin B6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zinc is crucial for follicle development and DNA synthesis, while B6 supports the HPO axis signaling during the lead-up to ovulation."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the 'Restore' protocol sequencing (Lesson 8), why is it recommended to address the HPA Axis/Stress response before implementing aggressive hormone-balancing herbs?",
            "options": [
                "Hormone herbs don't work if cortisol is high",
                "Stress management is easier for clients to start with",
                "The HPA axis provides the 'safety signal' to the HPO axis; without it, the body may resist hormonal shifts",
                "Cortisol is the only hormone that regulates the thyroid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis must be stabilized first because the body prioritizes survival (stress response) over reproduction (HPO axis). If the body feels 'unsafe' due to high cortisol, it will continue to suppress reproductive hormones."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client with PCOS has a high LH:FSH ratio (e.g., 3:1). What is the physiological consequence of this ratio on the ovaries?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid maturation of multiple eggs causing twins",
                "Premature luteinization of the follicle and overproduction of theca cell androgens",
                "Complete cessation of all hormone production",
                "Increased production of progesterone during the follicular phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high LH:FSH ratio stimulates the theca cells to produce excess androgens (like testosterone) and prevents the proper maturation of a dominant follicle, leading to 'string of pearls' cysts."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which intervention has been shown in clinical meta-analyses to be as effective as Metformin for improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS clients with fewer side effects?",

                "Magnesium Glycinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol has been clinically shown to match the efficacy of Metformin for ovulation induction and insulin sensitivity in PCOS populations."
