            "question": "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) officially recognized the menstrual cycle as the 'Fifth Vital Sign' for which primary reason?",
            "options": [
                "To simplify the process of prescribing hormonal contraceptives",
                "Because it serves as a powerful indicator of overall health and systemic dysfunction in women",
                "To standardize the timing of annual pelvic examinations",
                "Because menstrual blood loss is the primary cause of iron-deficiency anemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACOG and the AAP emphasize that the menstrual cycle provides a window into a woman's endocrine, cardiovascular, and bone health, making it a critical diagnostic tool for overall wellness."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a 28-day cycle but her Basal Body Temperature (BBT) charts show a slow rise and a luteal phase of only 9 days. What does this data most likely suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Successful conception has occurred",
                "Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD) and potentially low progesterone",
                "Estrogen dominance during the follicular phase",
                "A normal variation of the ovulatory response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase shorter than 10 days is clinically significant for Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD), often associated with insufficient progesterone production to support the uterine lining."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When utilizing Dried Urine Testing for Comprehensive Hormones (DUTCH), which specific advantage does it offer over standard serum (blood) testing?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only way to measure Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "It provides a measurement of hormone metabolites, showing how the body is processing and clearing hormones",
                "It is significantly less expensive than basic serum panels",
                "It measures bound hormones only, ignoring the free fraction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While serum measures the amount of hormone currently in the blood, urine testing provides insight into phase I and phase II liver metabolism through the measurement of hormone metabolites."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "For a client with a standard 28-day cycle, what is the 'Gold Standard' timing for testing Progesterone to confirm robust ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "Day 3 of the menstrual cycle",
                "Day 14, exactly at the time of expected ovulation",
                "Day 21, or 5-7 days post-ovulation",
                "Day 28, just before the onset of menses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone peaks in the mid-luteal phase. Testing on Day 21 (for a Day 14 ovulator) captures the peak of the corpus luteum activity."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In functional medicine, the 'optimal' range for TSH is typically considered to be 0.5–2.5 mIU/L. How does this compare to standard laboratory reference ranges?",
            "options": [
                "The functional range is wider to include more patients",
                "Standard lab ranges are based on a 'healthy' population, while functional ranges are based on the sickest 5%",
                "Standard lab ranges (often 0.5–4.5 mIU/L) are based on statistical averages of the general population, which may include undiagnosed thyroid dysfunction",
                "There is no difference between functional and standard ranges"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard ranges are derived from the 95th percentile of the population visiting that lab, which often includes people with subclinical issues. Functional ranges target the level where the majority of healthy, asymptomatic individuals sit."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the most reliable 'leading indicator' that the fertile window has opened, occurring before the rise in temperature?",
            "options": [
                "A drop in Basal Body Temperature",
                "The presence of 'Egg White' Cervical Mucus (EWCM)",
                "A sudden increase in resting heart rate",
                "The onset of mid-cycle spotting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cervical mucus changes in response to rising estrogen levels before ovulation occurs, making it the primary leading indicator of fertility, whereas BBT is a lagging indicator that confirms ovulation after the fact."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client reports heavy periods, cyclical breast tenderness, and irritability. Her serum labs show Progesterone at 12 ng/mL and Estradiol at 280 pg/mL on Day 21. What is the calculated PG/E2 ratio and its clinical significance?",
            "options": [
                "Ratio: 42; This is optimal and indicates balanced hormones",
                "Ratio: 23; This suggests 'Relative Estrogen Dominance' despite progesterone being in the 'normal' range",
                "Ratio: 120; This suggests a need for estrogen supplementation",
                "Ratio: 300; This indicates a high risk for PCOS"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PG/E2 ratio is calculated by converting ng/mL to pg/mL (12 x 1000 = 12,000) and dividing by estradiol (12,000 / 280 = 42.8). Note: The question options simplified the math, but a ratio below 100-200 often indicates relative estrogen dominance."
        },

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Methodologies of Hormone Testing' lesson, Saliva testing is uniquely suited for measuring which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid antibodies (TPO)",
                "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) via multiple morning samples",
                "Total Vitamin D levels",
                "Insulin resistance via HOMA-IR"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saliva is the preferred medium for CAR because it allows for easy, non-invasive collection at specific intervals (0, 30, and 60 minutes) immediately upon waking, which is difficult with blood draws."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Research suggests that approximately what percentage of women with 'regular' cycle lengths (21-35 days) may still experience anovulatory cycles or significant luteal insufficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Over 80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as those by Prior et al.) indicate that a regular bleed does not guarantee ovulation, with 10-15% of clinically regular cycles lacking a sufficient progesterone surge."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing a Client Hormone Profile, why is it critical to cross-reference subjective symptom mapping with objective lab data?",
            "options": [
                "To prove the client's symptoms are 'all in their head'",
                "Because lab tests are always 100% accurate and symptoms are not",
                "To identify 'Subclinical' patterns where labs may appear 'normal' but the client is experiencing significant physiological distress",
                "To ensure the health coach can prescribe the correct medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The synthesis of subjective and objective data allows the coach to see the full picture; often, symptoms precede lab abnormalities, or 'normal' labs mask functional imbalances that require intervention."
