            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "In advanced estrogen metabolism, which metabolite is known to form unstable 'depurinating adducts' that react with DNA, potentially increasing the risk of breast cell mutations?",
            "options": ["2-Hydroxyestrone (2-OH)", "4-Hydroxyestrone (4-OH)", "16-alpha-Hydroxyestrone (16-OH)", "2-Methoxyestrone (2-MeO)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4-OH pathway is considered the most 'reactive' because it can be oxidized into estrogen-3,4-quinones, which bind to DNA and create depurinating adducts, a known initiator of cancer-related mutations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' theory is largely considered an oversimplification. According to recent endocrinology research, what is the actual primary mechanism by which chronic stress lowers progesterone?",
            "options": ["Cortisol physically consumes the pregnenolone precursor in the mitochondria.", "The liver prioritizes cortisol clearance over progesterone synthesis.", "HPA axis activation suppresses the GnRH pulse generator, reducing LH signaling to the corpus luteum.", "Adrenal glands convert progesterone into DHEA-S to buffer stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the 'steal' implies a substrate shortage, the primary mechanism is the HPA axis's inhibitory effect on the HPG axis, where CRH and cortisol suppress GnRH pulsatility and LH secretion, leading to lower progesterone production."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Under the H.A.R.M.O.N.Y. approach for PCOS, a client with a BMI of 21, normal fasting insulin, but significantly elevated DHEA-S and high perceived stress would be classified as which phenotype?",
            "options": ["Insulin Resistant PCOS", "Post-Pill PCOS", "Adrenal PCOS", "Inflammatory PCOS"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adrenal PCOS accounts for roughly 10% of cases and is characterized by elevated adrenal androgens (DHEA-S) rather than ovarian androgens (testosterone) or insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which immune-hormone connection is most characteristic of Endometriosis pathophysiology?",
            "options": ["Decreased Th17 cell activity in the pelvic cavity.", "High levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in peritoneal fluid promoting aromatase expression in lesions.", "Suppression of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) leading to tissue atrophy.", "Increased progesterone receptor sensitivity leading to hyper-responsiveness."],
            "original_options": ["Decreased Th17 cell activity in the pelvic cavity.", "High levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in peritoneal fluid promoting aromatase expression in lesions.", "Suppression of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) leading to tissue atrophy.", "Increased progesterone receptor sensitivity leading to hyper-responsiveness."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis involves a 'vicious cycle' where inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) stimulate the enzyme aromatase within the lesions themselves, creating a local high-estrogen environment that further fuels growth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. What is the specific role of the enzyme Beta-glucuronidase in this process?",
            "options": ["It conjugates estrogen with glucuronic acid for excretion.", "It converts Estrone (E1) into the more potent Estradiol (E2).", "It deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed from the gut into the bloodstream.", "It breaks down the 16-OH pathway into 2-OH metabolites."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-glues' conjugated estrogen in the gut. When levels are too high (dysbiosis), estrogen that was meant for excretion is reabsorbed, contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Research into Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) suggests that the condition is not caused by a hormone deficiency, but rather an abnormal sensitivity to which neurosteroid?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Allopregnanolone (ALLO)", "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)", "Androstenedione"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMDD is linked to a maladaptive response of the GABA-A receptor to Allopregnanolone (a metabolite of progesterone). In PMDD sufferers, the normal 'calming' effect of ALLO is paradoxically altered."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In Postpartum Depletion, why is the 'Thyroid-Adrenal Reset' critical between months 3 and 6 postpartum?",
            "options": ["Estrogen levels reach their lifetime peak during this window.", "Progesterone levels drop to zero, causing immediate adrenal failure.", "The 'rebound' of the immune system can trigger postpartum thyroiditis and HPA dysregulation.", "This is the only time the body can absorb Selenium and Iodine."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postpartum is a high-risk time for autoimmune 'rebound' (Postpartum Thyroiditis) and HPA axis recalibration as the body moves from the high-steroid state of pregnancy to the low-steroid state of lactation/recovery."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "How do Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (EDCs) typically exert 'epigenetic transgenerational inheritance'?",
            "options": ["By changing the base-pair sequence of the DNA (mutagenesis).", "By altering DNA methylation patterns in germ cells that are passed to future generations.", "By increasing the rate of mitochondrial fission in liver cells.", "By permanently blocking all estrogen receptors in the F1 generation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs can cause epigenetic modifications (like DNA methylation) in the germline (sperm/eggs). Studies show these marks can persist through the F3 generation (grandchildren) even without further exposure."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 2-OH:16-OH ratio of 0.6 (Optimal > 2.0) and symptoms of heavy bleeding and fibroids. Which nutritional intervention specifically targets the induction of the CYP1A1 enzyme to improve this ratio?",
            "options": ["Vitex Agnus-Castus", "Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) from cruciferous vegetables", "Magnesium Glycinate", "Vitamine B12 (Methylcobalamin)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Indole-3-Carbinol (and its metabolite DIM) specifically induces the CYP1A1 enzyme, which favors the production of the 'protective' 2-OH pathway over the 16-OH pathway."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which specific statistic regarding PCOS and insulin resistance was highlighted in the module's phenotyping lesson?",
            "options": ["Only 10% of PCOS patients have insulin resistance.", "Insulin resistance is present in approximately 75% of lean and 95% of overweight PCOS patients.", "Insulin resistance only occurs in the 'Adrenal' phenotype.", "Insulin resistance is exclusively caused by high sugar intake in PCOS."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes that insulin resistance is a core driver for the vast majority of PCOS cases, affecting roughly 75% of lean women and up to 95% of those with a higher BMI."
