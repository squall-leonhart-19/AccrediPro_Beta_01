            "question": "According to the Hormone-First Nutrition Architecture, why is a high-protein breakfast (30g+) prioritized for clients with HPA-axis dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize thermogenesis for rapid weight loss",
                "To suppress glucagon production throughout the day",
                "To stabilize blood glucose and prevent the compensatory cortisol spikes associated with hypoglycemia",
                "To increase the production of SHBG to lower free testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high-protein breakfast provides the amino acids necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis and stabilizes blood glucose, preventing 'hypoglycemic stress' which triggers the adrenals to release cortisol to mobilize glucose."

            "question": "Which micronutrient synergy is most critical for the enzymatic conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone while simultaneously protecting the thyroid from oxidative damage?",

                "Zinc and Copper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a cofactor for deiodinase enzymes (T4 to T3 conversion), and research shows that when paired with Myo-Inositol, it significantly reduces TSH and thyroid antibodies in patients with Hashimoto’s."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "In the 'Estrobolome' (gut-hormone axis), what is the primary consequence of elevated beta-glucuronidase activity?",
            "options": [
                "Increased excretion of estrogen in the feces",
                "The deconjugation of estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into systemic circulation",

                "Enhanced synthesis of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-couples' estrogen from its glucuronic acid carrier, leading to the reabsorption of estrogen and contributing to estrogen dominance."

            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 4 indicates that achieving a specific Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio is associated with reduced dysmenorrhea. What is the target therapeutic ratio?",

                "1:10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet often reaches 15:1 or 20:1, a therapeutic ratio of 2:1 to 4:1 is required to shift the prostaglandin balance from pro-inflammatory (PGE2) to anti-inflammatory (PGE3) series."

            "options": [
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) decreases, requiring a 10% reduction in calories",
                "BMR increases by 5-10%, and the body shifts toward increased fat oxidation and a need for complex carbohydrates",
                "Insulin sensitivity increases, making high-glycemic sugars more tolerable",
                "Protein requirements drop as the body enters an anabolic state for potential pregnancy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone raises core body temperature and BMR in the luteal phase. This increase in energy expenditure (roughly 100-300 calories) requires more fuel, specifically complex carbs to support serotonin production and prevent PMDD symptoms."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "When addressing PCOS with therapeutic supplementation, what is the clinically validated ratio of Myo-Inositol to D-Chiro-Inositol required to improve insulin sensitivity and egg quality?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio mimics the physiological plasma ratio found in healthy women and is the most effective concentration for restoring ovulation and reducing androgen levels in PCOS patients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme requires methyl donors (like SAMe, B12, and Folate) to methylate estrogen metabolites, rendering them water-soluble for excretion."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (32) presents with heavy periods, breast tenderness, and high levels of fecal beta-glucuronidase. Which food-based intervention provides the specific glucaric acid needed to inhibit this enzyme?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucaric acid (found in apples, broccoli, and grapefruit) and its supplement form (Calcium D-Glucarate) directly inhibit beta-glucuronidase, preventing the reabsorption of estrogen."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Recovery Protocols,' why is 'Seed Syncing' utilized as a foundational tool despite limited large-scale clinical trials?",
            "options": [
                "It provides specific lignans and fatty acids that gently support estrogen metabolism in the first half and progesterone in the second half of the cycle",
                "It is the only way to get enough Omega-3s for hormone health",
                "It completely replaces the need for Phase II liver support",
                "The seeds contain actual human estrogen and progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Seed syncing uses flax/pumpkin (follicular) to provide lignans that bind excess estrogen, and sesame/sunflower (luteal) to provide zinc and selenium for progesterone support, acting as a gentle, food-based rhythm regulator."
