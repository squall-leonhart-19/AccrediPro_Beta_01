            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), or the 'Master Clock,' primarily coordinates peripheral clocks in the liver, gut, and ovaries by responding to which external cue?",
            "options": [
                "Ambient temperature changes",
                "Food intake and macronutrient ratios",
                "Blue light photons (460-480nm) via melanopsin receptors",
                "Physical activity and muscle contraction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SCN is primarily regulated by light-dark cycles. Specifically, melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are most sensitive to blue light in the 460-480nm range, which signals the SCN to suppress melatonin and promote wakefulness."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "During the Luteal phase, why is high-intensity interval training (HIIT) often less effective and potentially more stressful for the body?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen levels are at their lowest, reducing muscle glycogen storage",
                "Progesterone increases core body temperature and promotes a catabolic state",
                "Testosterone peaks during this phase, leading to overtraining syndrome",
                "The body enters a state of insulin hypersensitivity, causing hypoglycemia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the luteal phase, elevated progesterone increases the basal body temperature by approximately 0.5-1.0°F and can increase heart rate and respiratory rate. This reduces the threshold for heat stress and makes high-intensity exercise feel more taxing, potentially increasing allostatic load."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Which metabolite of progesterone is responsible for its sedative effect by binding to GABA-A receptors in the brain, thus supporting sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "Pregnenolone",
                "Androstenedione",
                "Allopregnanolone",
                "Dihydrotestosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent neurosteroid and metabolite of progesterone that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, facilitating the transition into Deep Sleep (N3) and maintaining sleep continuity."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to the concept of 'Allostatic Load,' what occurs when the HPA axis is chronically activated without sufficient recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Hormesis, which leads to increased mitochondrial density",
                "The 'wear and tear' on the body that results in dysregulation of the endocrine and immune systems",
                "An immediate and permanent increase in DHEA production",
                "A decrease in the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the cumulative biological cost of chronic exposure to fluctuating or elevated neural or neuroendocrine responses resulting from repeated or chronic stress."

            "question": "A client presents with 'Estrogen Dominance' symptoms. You discover she uses plastic containers (BPA) and scented candles (Phthalates). What is the primary mechanism of these Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the liver's ability to methylate estrogen",
                "They act as xenoestrogens, binding to estrogen receptors and mimicking or blocking natural hormones",
                "They destroy the ovaries' ability to produce progesterone",
                "They stimulate the thyroid to overproduce T4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs like BPA and phthalates are xenoestrogens. They possess a molecular structure similar enough to 17β-estradiol to bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), often triggering an amplified or inappropriate hormonal response."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In the HARMONY™ Lifestyle Protocol, 'Light Hygiene' suggests that exposure to bright light within the first 30 minutes of waking achieves what physiological goal?",
            "options": [

                "Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure (10,000+ lux) triggers the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). This pulse of cortisol not only promotes alertness but also sets an internal timer for melatonin production to begin approximately 14-16 hours later."

            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis mentioned in the course found that Mind-Body Interventions (MBIs) like Yoga and Mindfulness could reduce salivary cortisol levels by what average percentage in stressed women?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent Mind-Body Interventions have been shown in clinical data to reduce basal cortisol levels by roughly 15-25%, improving the HPA axis feedback loop and hormonal resilience."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. A higher HRV generally indicates a robust parasympathetic response and better 'Vagal Tone,' signifying greater resilience to stress."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Movement as Medicine: During the Ovulatory phase, which type of exercise is most appropriate given the peak in estrogen and testosterone?",

                "Complete bed rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During the ovulatory window, energy levels are typically at their highest due to estrogen and testosterone peaks. This is an ideal time for personal records in strength training, though coaches must advise caution as high estrogen can increase ligament laxity (ACL risk)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obesogens are a subset of EDCs that disrupt metabolic signaling. They can increase the number of fat cells (adipogenesis), alter metabolic rate, and interfere with hunger/satiety hormones like leptin and insulin."
