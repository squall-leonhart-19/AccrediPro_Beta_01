            "question": "Which statement best describes the 'Root Cause Philosophy' in hormone health coaching compared to the conventional medical model?",
            "options": [
                "The conventional model focuses on suppressing symptoms with exogenous hormones, while the root cause approach seeks to identify the physiological 'upstream' drivers of imbalance.",
                "The root cause approach ignores symptoms entirely to focus on genetic testing.",
                "The conventional model is only useful for acute care, while the root cause approach is only for chronic conditions.",
                "Root cause philosophy focuses on increasing dosage until symptoms resolve."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The root cause philosophy differentiates itself by looking 'upstream' at systems like the gut, HPA axis, and blood sugar, whereas conventional medicine often uses 'downstream' symptom suppression like the birth control pill."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the context of HPA Axis Dysregulation, what is the physiological consequence of the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (Progesterone Gallop)?",
            "options": [
                "Pregnenolone is converted into excess estrogen, leading to estrogen dominance.",
                "The body prioritizes the production of cortisol over sex hormones like progesterone to ensure survival during perceived stress.",
                "Cortisol levels drop to zero, causing immediate adrenal failure.",
                "The body converts all available progesterone into DHEA to boost energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes cortisol production (the survival hormone) using the precursor pregnenolone, which often leads to a relative deficiency in progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a specific subset of the gut microbiome. What is the primary role of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase in estrogen metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It synthesizes new estrogen from cholesterol in the colon.",
                "It binds estrogen to fiber for excretion in the stool.",
                "It uncouples conjugated estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream instead of being excreted.",
                "It converts estradiol (E2) into the weaker estriol (E3)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-zips' the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the estrogen to re-enter circulation, potentially contributing to estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Why are Xenoestrogens, a type of Endocrine Disrupting Chemical (EDC), particularly disruptive to the female hormonal system?",
            "options": [
                "They are only found in industrial waste and rarely encountered by the average client.",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors with higher affinity or different durations than endogenous estrogen, sending 'scrambled' signals to the endocrine system.",
                "They cause the body to stop producing estrogen entirely.",
                "They are water-soluble and easily flushed out of the system within hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens mimic natural estrogen but often bind more aggressively or stay bound to receptors longer, disrupting the delicate feedback loops of the HPO axis."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Chronic inflammation acts as a 'silent hormone saboteur' primarily by doing what to hormone receptors?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the number of receptors on the cell surface.",
                "Converting all receptors into insulin receptors.",
                "Downregulating receptor sensitivity, meaning higher levels of a hormone are required to achieve the same physiological effect.",
                "Inflammation has no direct effect on hormone receptors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines can interfere with hormone signaling pathways, causing 'hormone resistance' where the body has enough hormone, but the cells cannot 'hear' the signal."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A 2022 study highlighted that hyperinsulinemia (high insulin) directly impacts Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). What is the result of this interaction?",
            "options": [
                "High insulin increases SHBG, leading to low free testosterone.",
                "High insulin suppresses SHBG production in the liver, leading to higher levels of 'free' (active) testosterone and estrogen.",
                "Insulin and SHBG have no correlation.",
                "High insulin converts SHBG into cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin inhibits the liver's production of SHBG. When SHBG is low, more testosterone and estrogen circulate in their 'free' or unbound state, which can exacerbate symptoms like acne, hair loss, or heavy periods."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is essential for over 300 enzymatic reactions, including the detoxification of estrogen in the liver and the relaxation of the nervous system to support the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Iron",
                "Magnesium",
                "Calcium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is a critical 'spark plug' for hormone health, supporting liver detoxification (COMT pathway), insulin sensitivity, and the regulation of the stress response."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "How does blue light exposure after sunset specifically disrupt the hormonal architecture of the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to suppress melatonin, which in turn can disrupt the pulsatile release of GnRH and LH.",
                "It directly increases progesterone levels, causing early ovulation.",
                "It causes the thyroid to overproduce T4.",
                "It has no effect on hormones, only on eye strain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The SCN regulates our internal clock; blue light signals 'daytime,' suppressing melatonin. Melatonin has a protective relationship with the ovaries, and its suppression can disrupt the timing of the entire HPO axis."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (32) presents with PCOS, mid-section weight gain, and 'hangry' episodes. Her bloodwork shows normal total testosterone but low SHBG. Which root cause should be prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "Circadian Disruption",
                "Blood Sugar Instability and Hyperinsulinemia",

                "Heavy Metal Toxicity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms (mid-section weight, 'hangry') and her low SHBG are classic clinical markers of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which is a primary driver of PCOS symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "According to the Module 2 lessons, what percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, further illustrating the Gut-Brain-Hormone connection?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vast majority of serotonin (90-95%) is produced in the gut. This highlights why gut dysbiosis often manifests as mood disorders, which then impacts the HPA axis and hormone balance."
