            "question": "Which enzyme is primarily responsible for the Phase II methylation of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH) into the protective 2-methoxyestrone metabolite?",
            "options": [
                "CYP1A1",
                "COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase)",

                "CYP3A4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "COMT is the enzyme responsible for adding a methyl group to hydroxyestrogens (Phase II metabolism), rendering them water-soluble and less reactive."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the HPO-HPT-HPA Triad, how does chronic activation of the HPA axis (elevated cortisol) specifically impact thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of TSH from the pituitary.",
                "It inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3 and increases rT3.",
                "It stimulates thyroid peroxidase (TPO) activity.",
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid hormone receptors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation suppresses the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which converts T4 to T3, leading to lower active T3 levels and higher levels of the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."

                "A 100% incidence of Type 2 Diabetes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Classic PCOS is often driven by insulin resistance and obesity, Lean PCOS often involves a significant HPA-axis component and adrenal androgen excess."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is characterized by wide fluctuations in estrogen (spikes) while progesterone levels steadily decline due to more frequent anovulatory cycles."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the clinical significance of elevated beta-glucuronidase levels produced by the estrobolome?",
            "options": [
                "It improves the excretion of estrogen through the bile.",
                "It deconjugates estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation.",
                "It blocks the binding of estrogen to the Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ).",
                "It speeds up Phase I metabolism in the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-couples' estrogen that the liver has already processed for excretion, leading to higher systemic estrogen levels (re-circulation)."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "The 'Cortisol-Progesterone Nexus' explains that under chronic stress, progesterone levels drop primarily because:",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone is physically converted into cortisol via the 'Pregnenolone Steal'.",
                "Stress-induced HPA activation inhibits GnRH pulsatility, leading to poor corpus luteum function.",
                "Cortisol destroys the progesterone receptors in the uterus.",
                "The ovaries stop producing cholesterol, the precursor to all hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the 'steal' is a common myth, the actual mechanism is neuroendocrine: stress suppresses the signals (GnRH/LH) required for ovulation and robust progesterone production."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which class of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) is known to bioaccumulate in adipose tissue and mimic estrogen by binding to ERα receptors?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A ratio of 2.0 or higher is generally considered protective, as it indicates a preference for the 2-OH pathway over the more proliferative 16-OH pathway."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As the ovarian reserve declines and Inhibin B drops, the pituitary increases FSH production to try and stimulate the follicles, making elevated FSH a hallmark of early perimenopause."
