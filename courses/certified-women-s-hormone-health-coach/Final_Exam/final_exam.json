                "Rapid conversion of T4 to T3 in the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that deconjugates estrogen (breaks it apart from its 'package' for excretion), allowing it to be reabsorbed, which contributes to estrogen dominance."
