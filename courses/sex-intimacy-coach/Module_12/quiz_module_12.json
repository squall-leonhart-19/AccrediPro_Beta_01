            "question": "In the context of 'Subconscious Sexual Blueprints,' what is the primary function of identifying a client's 'Core Erotic Theme'?",
            "options": [
                "To categorize the client into a rigid psychological diagnostic box",
                "To uncover the underlying narrative that drives arousal and emotional connection",
                "To determine if a client has a clinical sexual dysfunction",
                "To replace their existing desires with more socially acceptable ones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Core Erotic Themes are the subconscious narratives or 'scripts' that dictate what a person finds arousing; identifying them allows for deeper self-awareness and intentional integration into their sex life."

            "question": "When navigating 'Taboo and Kink' (L2), what is the fundamental difference between the SSC and RACK frameworks?",
            "options": [
                "SSC is only for beginners, while RACK is for advanced practitioners",
                "SSC focuses on 'Safe, Sane, and Consensual,' while RACK acknowledges that no activity is 100% 'safe' and focuses on 'Risk-Aware Consensual Kink'",
                "RACK is a legal framework, while SSC is a psychological framework",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms for the same protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink) is often preferred in the community as it acknowledges inherent risks (physical or emotional) and emphasizes informed consent over the subjective term 'safe.'"

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the Neurobiology of Trust (L3), which branch of the nervous system must be dominant for 'Social Engagement' and deep intimacy to occur?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (Fight or Flight)",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (Freeze/Shutdown)",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (Safety and Connection)",
                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on Polyvagal Theory, the Ventral Vagal Complex is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System,' which allows for the vulnerability and safety required for true intimacy."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Sustaining the Spark.' According to Self-Expansion Theory, why do long-term relationships often experience a decline in desire?",
            "options": [
                "Because of a natural biological decline in oxytocin after 2 years",
                "Because the rate of 'self-expansion' slows down as partners become overly familiar and predictable",
                "Because partners stop engaging in physical exercise together",
                "Because of the accumulation of 'micro-traumas' that cannot be healed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-Expansion Theory suggests that we are attracted to the growth and new perspectives a partner brings; when a relationship becomes static and predictable, the 'expansion' stops, often leading to decreased desire."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In 'Somatic Integration' (L5), a 2021 study highlighted that individuals with higher 'Interoceptive Awareness' reported what outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Lower levels of physical arousal",
                "Higher levels of sexual satisfaction and easier access to orgasm",
                "Increased anxiety during sexual encounters",
                "A preference for kink over vanilla sex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive awareness—the ability to sense internal bodily signals—is strongly correlated with higher sexual satisfaction as it allows individuals to stay present with pleasurable sensations."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "When coaching a couple with 'Mismatched Desires' (L6), the 'Dual Control Model' suggests that a low-desire partner often has:",
            "options": [
                "A broken 'accelerator' (excitation system)",
                "A highly sensitive 'brake' (inhibition system) that responds to stress or lack of safety",
                "A lack of testosterone, regardless of gender",
                "A subconscious desire to end the relationship"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model (Nagoski et al.) posits that sexual response is a balance of excitation and inhibition; often, 'low desire' is actually the result of a highly active inhibition system (the 'brakes')."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a key trauma-informed somatic technique that ensures the client stays within their 'Window of Tolerance' by processing trauma in small, incremental steps."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Regarding 'Pleasure Expansion' (L8), how does chronic elevation of the HPA axis (stress response) specifically impact sexual wellness?",
            "options": [
                "It increases libido by boosting adrenaline",
                "It has no impact on sexual function",
                "It leads to 'cortisol steal,' where the body prioritizes stress hormones over sex hormones like testosterone and progesterone",
                "It improves erectile function by increasing blood flow to the core"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress causes the HPA axis to prioritize cortisol production, which can 'steal' precursors needed for sex hormones, leading to hormonal imbalances and decreased libido."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client describes feeling 'numb' or 'disconnected' from their body during intimacy. Which intervention from Module 12 is MOST appropriate to start with?",
            "options": [
                "Advanced Biohacking with testosterone supplements",
                "Somatic Integration techniques like the 'Body Scan' to build interoceptive pathways",
                "Introducing high-intensity Kink to 'shock' the system into feeling",
                "Analyzing their childhood blueprints to find the source of the numbness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numbness or dissociation is a somatic issue; building the 'mind-body' bridge through interoceptive exercises like a body scan is the foundational step for re-establishing sensation."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "According to research on 'Responsive Desire' (L6), what percentage of women in long-term relationships primarily experience desire *after* physical stimulation has begun?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5-10%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Between 60-80%",
                "Nearly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a significant majority (60-80%) of women in long-term partnerships rely on 'responsive desire,' meaning they don't feel 'hungry' for sex until the 'meal' has actually started."
