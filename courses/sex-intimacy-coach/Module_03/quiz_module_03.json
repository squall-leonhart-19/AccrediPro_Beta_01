            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which state must the nervous system be in to facilitate the 'Safe Container' necessary for deep sexual intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Activation state",
                "The Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement) state",
                "The Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown) state",
                "The Hyper-arousal state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' branch of the nervous system. It allows for the prefrontal cortex to remain active, enabling connection, trust, and the ability to interpret a partner's touch as pleasurable rather than threatening."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client with an Anxious-Preoccupied attachment style often uses 'protest behaviors' when they feel trust is wavering. Which of the following is a hallmark of this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Withdrawing and seeking physical distance",
                "Excessive calling, texting, or seeking constant reassurance to re-establish connection",
                "Complete emotional indifference to the partner's actions",
                "A preference for casual sex over intimate connection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anxious-Preoccupied individuals often respond to perceived threats to trust by 'moving toward' the partner aggressively or frantically to ensure the bond is still intact, often referred to as protest behavior."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the 'Three Pillars of Relational Trust' model, which pillar is being compromised when a partner is highly skilled and caring but consistently fails to follow through on scheduled commitments?",
            "options": [
                "The Pillar of Competence",
                "The Pillar of Benevolence (Care)",
                "The Pillar of Integrity (Consistency)",
                "The Pillar of Vulnerability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Pillar of Integrity/Consistency refers to the predictability of a partner's behavior. Even if they are kind (Benevolence) and capable (Competence), a lack of reliability erodes the foundational sense of safety."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Daniel Coyle’s 'Vulnerability Loop' suggests that trust is not a prerequisite for vulnerability, but rather a result of it. What is the essential second step of this loop?",
            "options": [
                "Person A hides their weakness to appear strong",
                "Person B ignores the signal to avoid awkwardness",
                "Person B acknowledges the signal and responds with their own vulnerability",
                "Person A immediately asks for a commitment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The loop is completed when the recipient of a vulnerability signal acknowledges it and reciprocates. This mutual exchange signals to the brain that it is safe to cooperate and connect."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "In the Gottman 'Atone, Attune, Attach' model for rebuilding trust after betrayal, what is required during the 'Atone' phase?",
            "options": [
                "The betrayed partner must immediately forgive and move on",
                "The betraying partner must show remorse and provide full transparency without defensiveness",
                "The couple should avoid talking about the betrayal to prevent further pain",
                "The couple should focus solely on improving their sexual frequency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Atonement requires the betraying partner to take full responsibility, express genuine remorse, and allow the betrayed partner to ask questions with total transparency. Without this, the 'Attune' phase cannot begin."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "The 'FRIES' model of consent is a critical tool for sexual boundaries. What does the 'I' in FRIES stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate (consent must be given right now)",
                "Informed (knowing exactly what is being agreed to)",
                "Internal (feeling it on the inside)",
                "Intense (showing high levels of arousal)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent means that all parties understand the specifics of the activity, including risks, boundaries, and the use of protection/contraception."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Neurobiologically, why does high chronic stress (Elevated Cortisol) make it difficult for partners to build intimacy?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol increases the production of oxytocin",
                "Cortisol promotes the 'tend-and-befriend' response",
                "High cortisol levels inhibit oxytocin receptors, making the 'cuddle hormone' less effective",
                "Cortisol has no impact on relational trust"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol keep the body in a state of high alert (Sympathetic nervous system), which biologically blunts the effects of oxytocin, the hormone responsible for bonding and trust."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "During a 'Trust Audit' assessment, a coach notices a couple has many 'Sliding Door Moments' (Gottman). What does this term refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Physical boundaries in the household",
                "Small, seemingly insignificant moments where one partner reaches out for connection and the other either turns toward or away",
                "The moment a partner decides to leave a relationship",
                "The transition from the bedroom to other areas of the house"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sliding Door Moments are the building blocks of trust. Choosing to 'turn toward' a partner's bid for emotional connection builds the 'emotional bank account' that sustains the relationship during conflict."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Disorganized' (Fearful-Avoidant) attachment. What is the most likely challenge they face in a sexual container?",
            "options": [
                "They are too trusting and lack any boundaries",
                "They find sex boring and prefer to avoid it entirely",
                "They experience a 'fright without solution,' simultaneously craving intimacy but feeling terrified when it occurs",
                "They only feel safe when their partner is completely submissive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment stems from caregivers being a source of both fear and comfort. In adulthood, this manifests as an intense desire for closeness coupled with a nervous system that perceives that same closeness as a threat."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a practical exercise for 'Proactive Consent' in a long-term relationship?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Yes/No/Maybe' list for sexual activities",
                "Waiting for the partner to initiate every time to avoid rejection",
                "Assuming consent is implied because they are married",
                "Only discussing boundaries after an uncomfortable event has occurred"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A 'Yes/No/Maybe' list is a proactive tool that allows partners to explore boundaries and desires in a non-aroused state, ensuring that when intimacy occurs, both partners are already 'Informed' and 'Specific' about their consent."
