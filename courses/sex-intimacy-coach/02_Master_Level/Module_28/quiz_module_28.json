            "options": [
                "To conduct a deep-dive into the childhood origins of the behavior",

                "To provide an immediate diagnosis of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder",
                "To facilitate a formal disclosure session between partners"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In crisis management, the first priority is always safety and stabilization. This involves assessing for immediate risks (suicidality, self-harm, or intimate partner violence) before moving into deeper psychological work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on betrayal trauma, such as those by Dr. Kevin Skinner, suggest that 30% to 70% of betrayed partners experience significant PTSD symptoms, including flashbacks, hypervigilance, and emotional numbing."

            "question": "According to the ICD-11 criteria for Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD), how long must the pattern of failure to control intense sexual impulses persist before a diagnosis can be made?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The World Health Organization's ICD-11 specifies that the pattern of repetitive sexual activities must be evident over a period of at least 6 months to meet the diagnostic threshold for CSBD."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance (coined by Dan Siegel) is the optimal zone of nervous system arousal. If a client is hyper-aroused (fight/flight) or hypo-aroused (freeze), they cannot effectively process somatic or emotional work."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Poly-bomb' occurs when one partner suddenly demands an open structure, often as a way to legitimize an existing affair or as a desperate attempt to fix a failing relationship without prior mutual exploration."

            "explanation": "Contempt—the expression of superiority that targets the partner's sense of self—is the most toxic of the four behaviors and is the strongest predictor of divorce in longitudinal studies."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "A coach discovers a client is experiencing 'Hypersexuality' accompanied by a decreased need for sleep and pressured speech. What is the most ethical course of action?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize when a 'sexual' issue is actually a symptom of a clinical mental health condition like Bipolar Disorder. Pressured speech and decreased need for sleep are red flags for mania requiring medical referral."

            "options": [
                "It prevents the betrayed partner from ever feeling happy again",
                "It bypasses the necessary processing of trauma, often leading to delayed PTSD or resentment",
                "It is a violation of the coach's ethical code of conduct",
                "It makes the unfaithful partner feel too much guilt"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rug-sweeping prevents the couple from addressing the underlying issues and the trauma of the betrayal, which often results in 'volcanic' emotional outbursts later or chronic emotional disconnection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
