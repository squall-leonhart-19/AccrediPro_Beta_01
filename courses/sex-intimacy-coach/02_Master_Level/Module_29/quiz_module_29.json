                "It is followed as a rigid, linear 8-step protocol to ensure clinical safety.",
                "It transitions from a linear checklist to a non-linear, holistic 'field' where the practitioner dances between phases based on real-time somatic resonance.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the 'I' (Inquiry) and 'N' (Neurology) phases, omitting the spiritual components.",
                "It is replaced entirely by the practitioner's intuition without a structured framework."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves the 'Unified Field' application, where the practitioner has internalized the framework so deeply that they can move fluidly and non-linearly between phases based on the client's emergent needs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Erotic Flow requires the Ventral Vagal system to remain online, providing a container of safety that allows the Sympathetic nervous system to mobilize energy (arousal) without triggering a fight-or-flight defense."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shame transformation involves moving from 'Shadow' to 'Integration,' where repressed desires are understood and their underlying energy is harnessed for more authentic and powerful erotic expression."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Limbic resonance is a physiological state where partners' nervous systems align, leading to synchronized heart rate variability (HRV) and respiration, which facilitates deep trust and intimacy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the Master Practitioner knows that 'titration' and 'resourcing' are key; you must build the capacity of the nervous system (the container) before processing the 'heat' of the trauma or dysfunction."
