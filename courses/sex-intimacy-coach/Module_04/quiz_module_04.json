            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen), sexual arousal is a balance between which two neurological systems?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic systems",
                "The Sexual Excitation System (SES) and Sexual Inhibition System (SIS)",
                "The Dopaminergic pathway and the Serotonergic pathway",
                "The Limbic system and the Prefrontal Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model posits that sexual response is governed by the SES (the 'accelerator') and the SIS (the 'brakes'). Effective coaching often involves 'lifting the brakes' rather than just 'hitting the gas'."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Research on desire frameworks suggests that 'Responsive Desire' is the primary experience for what percentage of women in long-term committed relationships?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 60-80%",
                "Nearly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by Basson (2000) and later clinical observations, indicate that 60-80% of women in long-term relationships rely on responsive desire (arousal preceding desire) rather than spontaneous desire."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, we discussed 'Interoception.' How is this defined in the context of sensory awakening?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to perceive external stimuli like touch and sound",
                "The cognitive process of imagining erotic scenarios",
                "The perception of internal bodily states, such as heartbeat or muscle tension",
                "The psychological projection of desire onto a partner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Improving interoceptive awareness helps clients move from 'head-based' anxiety into 'body-based' arousal."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "The 'Coolidge Effect' describes a biological phenomenon where the introduction of a new receptive partner leads to:",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in refractory period and a spike in dopamine",
                "An increase in oxytocin and a decrease in testosterone",
                "A permanent shift from responsive to spontaneous desire",
                "The habituation of the Sexual Excitation System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Coolidge Effect is a phenomenon seen in mammals where males (and to a lesser extent females) exhibit renewed sexual interest and a shortened refractory period when introduced to new partners, driven by the dopaminergic reward system."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In the 'Domesticity Paradox' (Lesson 7), Esther Perel argues that eroticism requires a tension between which two conflicting human needs?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perel's work highlights that while intimacy grows on comfort and security, eroticism requires distance, mystery, and a sense of the 'other' to thrive."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "What neurological state is associated with the 'Flow State' during sex, characterized by a loss of self-consciousness and time distortion?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperfrontality of the Prefrontal Cortex",

                "Thalamic Suppression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transient Hypofrontality is the temporary 'downregulation' of the prefrontal cortex (the analytical part of the brain), allowing the individual to be fully immersed in the sensory experience without self-judgment."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "During Erotic Mapping (Lesson 5), a client identifies that 'feeling seen and admired' is their primary igniter. This is categorized as which type of igniter?",

                "Sensory Igniter",
                "Contextual Igniter",
                "Psychological/Emotional Igniter",
                "Bio-chemical Igniter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feeling admired or validated is a psychological/emotional igniter, as it relates to the mental and relational state rather than physical touch or environmental factors."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Mark' reports he loves his partner but feels 'bored' after 10 years. According to the 'Ignite Protocol,' what is the most effective dopamine-focused intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Scheduling sex at the same time every week for consistency",
                "Introducing 'Novelty and Risk' through new environments or activities",
                "Increasing the duration of foreplay using known techniques",
                "Focusing exclusively on oxytocin-building activities like cuddling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To combat habituation and trigger dopamine, the Ignite Protocol suggests introducing novelty, variety, or 'controlled risk' to re-engage the brain's reward centers."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that mindfulness-based interventions for sexual desire resulted in an average effect size of:",
            "options": [
                "d = 0.15 (Small)",
                "d = 0.30 (Moderate)",

                "d = 0.90 (Very Large)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) consistently show moderate to large effect sizes (around 0.50-0.60) in improving sexual desire and decreasing sexual distress, particularly in women."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "If a client has a highly sensitive Sexual Inhibition System (SIS), what is the likely result of adding 'spices' or 'novelty' to the bedroom without addressing their stressors?",
            "options": [
                "The novelty will override the inhibition immediately",
                "The client will likely experience increased anxiety or further shutdown",
                "Desire will shift from responsive to spontaneous",
                "The SES will automatically recalibrate to a higher baseline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For a client with a sensitive SIS, adding 'accelerators' (novelty) without removing 'brakes' (stress/anxiety) often backfires, as the new stimuli are perceived as additional pressure or threats."
