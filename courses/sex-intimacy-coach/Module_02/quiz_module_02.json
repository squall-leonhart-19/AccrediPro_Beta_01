            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, what is the primary psychological distinction between 'sexual shame' and 'sexual guilt'?",
            "options": [
                "Shame is a focus on a specific behavior, while guilt is a focus on the self.",
                "Shame is an ontological evaluation ('I am bad'), while guilt is a behavioral evaluation ('I did something bad').",
                "Guilt is always pathological, whereas shame is a healthy social regulator.",
                "Shame is externally imposed by society, while guilt is purely biological."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shame is an internalised sense of being flawed as a person, whereas guilt refers to the feeling of regret over a specific action. In sex coaching, de-stigmatization involves moving a client from global self-shame to objective behavioral observation."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) and subsequent data discussed in Lesson 2, what is the 'statistical reality' regarding sexual frequency for most adult couples?",
            "options": [
                "The vast majority of healthy couples have intercourse 5+ times per week.",
                "There is no statistical average; sexual frequency is entirely random.",
                "The most common frequency for married couples is approximately once a week, with significant 'normal' variance ranging from several times a week to once a month.",
                "Couples who have sex less than once a week are statistically likely to divorce within 2 years."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normalization involves showing clients that 'once a week' is a common average, but that a wide bell curve exists. Understanding this helps remove the pressure of the 'performance myth' and the 'sex-starved' stigma."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 introduces Rosemary Basson’s Circular Model of Sexual Response. How does this model help normalize 'Responsive Desire'?",
            "options": [
                "It proves that spontaneous desire is the only healthy form of libido.",
                "It illustrates that desire can follow physical arousal and emotional intimacy, rather than always preceding it.",
                "It suggests that desire is a fixed trait that cannot be changed through intervention.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the resolution phase of the sexual response cycle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Basson's model is crucial for normalizing the experience of many individuals (particularly in long-term relationships) who do not experience 'spontaneous' hunger for sex but find that desire emerges once they begin a sensual or intimate encounter."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "What is 'Arousal Non-Concordance,' as discussed in Lesson 4, and why is it critical for a coach to normalize it?",
            "options": [
                "It is the inability to achieve orgasm despite high levels of desire.",
                "It is a mismatch between physical genital response (lubrication/erection) and the subjective experience of pleasure or desire.",
                "It is the psychological state of wanting sex but being physically unable to perform.",
                "It refers to a couple having different 'love languages'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Arousal non-concordance (e.g., a physical response without subjective desire, or vice versa) is a normal physiological occurrence. Normalizing this prevents clients from feeling 'broken' or confused by their body's involuntary responses."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A 2014 study by Richters et al. found that approximately what percentage of the general population reported finding at least one BDSM activity 'appealing' or 'somewhat appealing'?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Nearly 50%",
                "Exactly 85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Richters et al. (2014) study (n=4,331) found that nearly half of the population expressed interest in Kink/BDSM, supporting the 'Normalization' pillar by showing that these interests are common, rather than fringe or pathological."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Gagnon and Simon’s 'Sexual Scripts Theory' (Lesson 6) suggests that sexual behavior is guided by which three levels of scripting?",
            "options": [
                "Biological, Psychological, and Spiritual",
                "Cultural Scenarios, Interpersonal Scripting, and Intrapsychic Scripting",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sexual Scripts Theory posits that our sexuality is shaped by the broad culture (Cultural Scenarios), our interactions with others (Interpersonal), and our private fantasies and desires (Intrapsychic)."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "When working with older adults (Lesson 7), a coach should normalize which of the following physiological changes?",
            "options": [
                "The complete cessation of sexual desire after age 65.",
                "A longer 'refractory period' for men and the need for more direct stimulation for women due to hormonal shifts.",
                "The idea that sex is no longer safe for individuals with heart conditions.",
                "The necessity of HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) for all post-menopausal women."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normalizing the aging process involves explaining that while the 'speed' or 'intensity' of response might change (longer refractory periods, slower lubrication), sexual satisfaction can remain high throughout the lifespan."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the 'Normalization Toolkit' (Lesson 8), the technique of 'Universalizing' involves which of the following phrases?",
            "options": [
                "'You should really try to change that.'",
                "'Many of my clients experience exactly what you are describing.'",
                "'That is a very rare condition; you should see a doctor.'",
                "'Why do you think you feel that way?'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universalizing is a powerful reframing tool that reduces the client's sense of isolation by placing their experience within the context of the broader human experience."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah and Mark struggle with desire discrepancy. Sarah only feels desire after 20 minutes of cuddling, while Mark feels it spontaneously. Using the 'N' in the methodology, what is the coach's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose Sarah with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD).",
                "To tell Mark he is being too demanding.",
                "To explain that both spontaneous and responsive desire are 'normal' variations of the human sexual response.",
                "To suggest they try a specific kink to bridge the gap."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Normalize' phase requires the coach to validate both experiences as healthy variations. This reduces the 'blame' dynamic and allows the couple to move toward the 'O: Optimize' phase without shame."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Reframing' skill in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "To ignore the client's problems and focus only on the positive.",
                "To change the linguistic 'frame' of a situation from one of pathology or 'brokenness' to one of growth or variation.",
                "To convince the client that their partner is wrong.",
                "To provide a medical diagnosis for sexual dysfunction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing takes a client's 'problem' (e.g., 'I am a failure because I can't get an erection') and shifts it to a functional observation (e.g., 'Your body is communicating that it needs more relaxation or different stimulation'), which is the essence of normalization."
