            "question": "According to Dr. Daniel Siegel’s definition of attunement, what is the primary subjective experience of the client when a practitioner is successfully attuned?",
            "options": [
                "The experience of 'feeling felt' through the alignment of internal states.",
                "The intellectual understanding of the practitioner's advice.",
                "The physical sensation of relaxation in the parasympathetic nervous system.",
                "The ability to mirror the practitioner's body language exactly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Daniel Siegel defines attunement as the process by which we focus our attention on others and take their internal state into our own, creating the subjective experience of 'feeling felt.'"

            "question": "In Lesson 2, 'Interoception' is identified as a critical component of self-attunement. What does a 2018 study suggest about individuals with higher interoceptive awareness?",
            "options": [
                "They are more likely to experience emotional contagion and burnout.",
                "They demonstrate higher levels of sexual satisfaction and better emotional regulation.",
                "They have a lower threshold for physical pain during intimate encounters.",
                "They rely more heavily on external validation from partners."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high interoceptive awareness (the ability to sense internal bodily signals) correlates with better emotional regulation and increased sexual satisfaction due to better boundary sensing."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client, 'Mark,' reports that during intimacy, he often feels 'numb' or 'checked out,' which corresponds to a Dorsal Vagal state in Polyvagal Theory. What is the most appropriate somatic attunement intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Encouraging him to push through the numbness to reach orgasm.",
                "Using high-intensity sensory input to 'shock' the system back to life.",
                "Gently slowing the pace and using grounding techniques to return to the Window of Tolerance.",
                "Immediate cessation of all touch for at least 30 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client enters a Dorsal Vagal (shutdown) state, the goal is to gently invite them back into the Ventral Vagal (social engagement) zone using grounding and pacing, rather than force or over-stimulation."

            "question": "What is the fundamental difference between 'Emotional Resonance' and 'Emotional Contagion' in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "Resonance is accidental, while contagion is a deliberate coaching technique.",
                "Resonance involves feeling 'with' the client while maintaining boundaries; contagion is taking on the client's stress as your own.",
                "Contagion is necessary for empathy, while resonance is considered too clinical.",
                "There is no difference; both terms describe the same neurological process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional resonance allows a coach to mirror and understand a client's emotion without losing their own center, whereas contagion leads to vicarious trauma or burnout."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Validation Loop is only closed when the coach checks for accuracy, ensuring the client's subjective experience has been correctly interpreted."

                "A lack of physical attraction to the partner.",
                "Low testosterone or hormonal imbalances only.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen) posits that sexual response is a balance of excitation and inhibition. Often, 'low desire' is actually high 'inhibition' (the brakes) triggered by stress or lack of safety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Naming the rupture ('I feel like we just lost our connection, let's pause') is the first step in the repair cycle, which often strengthens the therapeutic alliance more than never having a rupture at all."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic attunement involves noticing non-verbal cues (micro-expressions) and offering them back to the client with curiosity and without judgment to explore underlying 'brakes' or shame."
