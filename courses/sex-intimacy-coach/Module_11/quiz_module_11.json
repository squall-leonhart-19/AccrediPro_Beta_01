            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the INTIMATE Method™ identifies specific neurobiological states. Which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for the 'Bonding and Buffered Stress' response during the 'Attune' phase?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Oxytocin", "Cortisol", "Vasopressin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin is the primary neurotransmitter associated with bonding, trust, and the reduction of cortisol (stress) during somatic attunement and intimate connection."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "When conducting an 'Advanced Investigation' using a Sexual Genogram (Lesson 2), what is the primary objective of mapping three generations of sexual history?",
            "options": ["To identify genetic predispositions to sexual dysfunction", "To uncover intergenerational scripts and 'ghosts in the bedroom'", "To determine the exact frequency of sexual activity in the family tree", "To diagnose clinical sexual disorders in ancestors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The sexual genogram is used to decode intergenerational scripts, traumas, and 'ghosts'—the unspoken rules or patterns passed down through families that influence current sexual behavior."
        },

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the RACK framework in BDSM and Kink dynamics. What does the acronym RACK stand for?",
            "options": ["Reliable, Authentic, Consensual Kink", "Risk-Aware Consensual Kink", "Radical Acceptance and Conscious Kink", "Responsible Agreement and Consensual Kink"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RACK (Risk-Aware Consensual Kink) acknowledges that all sexual activities involve some level of risk and focuses on informed consent and risk management rather than the 'perfect safety' implied by the older SSC (Safe, Sane, Consensual) model."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to the Anatomy of Betrayal Recovery (Lesson 4), what must occur during the 'Atonement' phase before moving to 'Attunement'?",
            "options": ["The betrayed partner must offer immediate forgiveness", "The betraying partner must show total transparency and take full responsibility without defensiveness", "The couple must resume sexual intimacy to prove commitment", "The betraying partner must explain 'why' the betrayal happened in exhaustive detail"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Atonement requires the betraying partner to demonstrate total transparency, consistency, and a willingness to take full responsibility for the hurt caused, creating the safety necessary for the next phase."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In the Dual Control Model (Lesson 5), a client who is easily 'turned off' by a messy room or the sound of children in the next room is demonstrating:",
            "options": ["A high Sexual Excitation System (SES)", "A low Sexual Inhibition System (SIS)", "A high Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) / Sensitive Brakes", "Sexual Aversion Disorder"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High SIS (Sexual Inhibition System) sensitivity means the 'brakes' are easily activated by external stressors, distractions, or perceived threats, which overrides the excitation system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes 'Somatic Attunement.' A 2022 study on 'Limbic Resonance' suggests that partners who practice synchronized breathing for 5 minutes daily show:",
            "options": ["A 15% increase in sexual frequency", "A 30% reduction in physiological arousal during conflict", "A 50% increase in testosterone levels", "No measurable change in relationship satisfaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic attunement practices like synchronized breathing foster co-regulation, which significantly reduces physiological 'flooding' and arousal during subsequent conflicts."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In Transformative Shadow Work (Lesson 7), the 'Golden Shadow' in a sexual context represents:",
            "options": ["The most traumatic sexual experiences a client has faced", "The repressed, positive aspects of a client's sexuality that they feel unworthy of claiming", "The 'perfect' sexual persona a client presents to the world", "A state of total sexual enlightenment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Shadow' contains the positive traits, desires, and capacities (like power, playfulness, or vulnerability) that a client has repressed because they feel too 'big' or 'dangerous' to embody."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "The 'Expansion: Intimacy Sustainability Roadmap' (Lesson 8) addresses 'Habituation.' What is the primary psychological mechanism used to counter the 'Coolidge Effect' in long-term relationships?",
            "options": ["Increasing the frequency of routine sex", "Introducing controlled novelty and 'erotic friction'", "Focusing solely on emotional intimacy and ignoring physical desire", "Taking a 'sexual hiatus' for three months"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved by introducing novelty and 'erotic friction'—elements of surprise, play, and new experiences that stimulate the dopamine system and counter habituation."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Sarah' (34) has a high SES but feels 'broken' because she cannot reach orgasm when stressed. According to Lesson 5, what is the most effective coaching intervention?",
            "options": ["Focus on increasing her SES through more stimulation", "Focus on 'removing the brakes' (lowering SIS) by addressing environmental stressors", "Prescribe more intensive pelvic floor exercises", "Suggest she use more aggressive toys during sex"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Dual Control Model, if the 'brakes' (SIS) are pushed down by stress, no amount of 'gas' (SES stimulation) will result in arousal or orgasm. The intervention must focus on lowering inhibition."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which phase of the INTIMATE Method™ specifically focuses on the 'Inquire' step to bridge the gap between somatic sensation and cognitive understanding?",
            "options": ["Phase 2: Notice", "Phase 4: Inquire", "Phase 7: Transform", "Phase 8: Expand"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Inquire' phase (Phase 4) is where the coach helps the client move from 'Noticing' a sensation to understanding the narrative or meaning behind that sensation, facilitating deep insight."
