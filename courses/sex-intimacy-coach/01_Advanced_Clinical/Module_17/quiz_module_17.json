            "question": "A client with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) reports that they often feel 'disconnected' or 'numb' during sexual intimacy despite being attracted to their partner. Which neurobiological factor is most likely contributing to this experience?",
            "options": [
                "Hypersensitivity to tactile input causing a shutdown of the sensory system.",
                "A lack of emotional empathy common in ASD profiles.",
                "Chronic low levels of oxytocin production.",
                "The 'hyper-systemizing' brain type which prioritizes logic over physical sensation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Individuals with ASD often experience sensory processing differences; hypersensitivity can lead to sensory overload, causing the brain to 'shut down' or mute tactile input as a protective mechanism (sensory gating), leading to a feeling of numbness or disconnection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spoon Theory is a disability metaphor used to explain the reduced amount of energy available for activities of daily living and productive tasks that may result from chronic illness or disability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Successful reconstruction requires acknowledging that the 'old' marriage is over. Marriage 2.0 focuses on building a new, more resilient relationship structure rather than trying to fix a broken version of the previous one."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD brains are characterized by a 'reward deficiency' or lower dopamine stimulation; novelty provides a significant dopamine spike, making routine intimacy feel under-stimulating or 'boring' for the ADHD partner."
