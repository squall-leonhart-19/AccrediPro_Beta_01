            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen), which physiological state is most predictive of a sexual dysfunction diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "Low Sexual Excitation (SES) scores only",
                "High Sexual Inhibition (SIS) scores, particularly SIS1 (threat of performance failure)",
                "A perfect balance between SES and SIS scores",
                "High Sexual Excitation (SES) combined with low dopamine levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high Sexual Inhibition (SIS) is a stronger predictor of sexual dysfunction than low excitation. Specifically, SIS1 (fear of performance failure) and SIS2 (fear of consequences) act as the 'brake' system that overrides arousal."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the context of Attachment Theory, how does 'Anxious Attachment' typically manifest in sexual behavior according to the research by Mikulincer & Shaver?",
            "options": [
                "A preference for casual sex to avoid emotional closeness",
                "Using sex as a tool for proximity-seeking and reassurance of a partner's love",
                "Total avoidance of sexual activity due to fear of vulnerability",
                "Higher levels of sexual self-efficacy and exploration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with anxious attachment often use sexual intimacy as a way to achieve emotional closeness and reduce fears of abandonment, frequently seeking reassurance through physical connection."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Polyvagal Theory suggests that for intimacy to occur, the nervous system must be in which state?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Activation (Fight or Flight)",
                "Dorsal Vagal Shutdown (Freeze/Faint)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the foundation of the Social Engagement System. It allows for feelings of safety and connection, which are neurobiological prerequisites for healthy sexual intimacy."

                "Spontaneous desire only",
                "Sexual distress and concordance between physical arousal and subjective desire",

                "Total testosterone levels in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MBST research highlights that mindfulness improves the 'arousal gap' or concordance, helping individuals better perceive their body's physical responses and reducing the psychological distress associated with low desire."

            "id": "q19_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A total FSFI score of 26.55 or lower is the widely accepted clinical threshold for identifying women at risk for sexual dysfunction across multiple domains."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis comparing Pharmacological (Flibanserin) vs. Behavioral (CBT) interventions for low desire found what regarding efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "Pharmacology was 5x more effective than behavioral therapy",
                "CBT showed larger effect sizes for long-term satisfaction and lower side-effect profiles",
                "Flibanserin resulted in an average of 5 additional satisfying sexual events per month",
                "Neither intervention outperformed a placebo in any clinical trial"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Flibanserin is FDA-approved, meta-analyses show it typically yields only 0.5 to 1 additional satisfying sexual event per month, whereas CBT and MBST often show broader improvements in relationship satisfaction and desire without medical side effects."

                "Increasing the intensity of sexual stimuli as quickly as possible",
                "Measuring the exact volume of hormonal secretions during arousal",
                "Experiencing small, manageable amounts of 'felt sense' to process trauma without flooding the nervous system",
                "The chemical process of mixing essential oils for sensory play"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration is a core trauma-informed principle (often associated with Somatic Experiencing) that involves slowing down the process so the client can integrate small amounts of sensation without triggering a full sympathetic 'flood' or shutdown."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Which neurochemical is primarily responsible for the 'Excitation' (SES) side of the Dual Control Model, acting as the gas pedal for desire?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin",
                "Dopamine",
                "Prolactin",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter of the reward and motivation system, driving the 'seeking' behavior and sexual excitation (SES). Serotonin and Prolactin generally act as inhibitors."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Dismissive-Avoidant' attachment style. According to clinical evidence, how are they likely to view sexual intimacy within a long-term relationship?",
            "options": [
                "As a way to merge completely with their partner",
                "As a threat to their autonomy, leading to 'deactivating strategies' like withdrawing after sex",
                "With high levels of anxiety and a need for constant verbal praise during the act",
                "Avoidant individuals generally do not engage in sex at all"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Avoidant individuals often use 'deactivating strategies' to maintain emotional distance and autonomy, which can manifest as pulling away or becoming critical of a partner following periods of high intimacy."

            "options": [
                "Physical genital response always matches subjective feelings of 'turned on'",
                "The brain and genitals can respond independently; physical arousal does not always mean the person is 'horny' or consenting",
                "Non-concordance is a sign of a neurological disorder",
                "Only men experience concordance; women never do"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Arousal non-concordance is a normal physiological phenomenon, especially in women, where genital blood flow can occur in response to stimuli without the person subjectively feeling sexual desire or pleasure."
