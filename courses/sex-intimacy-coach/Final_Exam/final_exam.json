            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the I.N.T.I.M.A.T.E. Connection Method™, the 'Investigate' phase is primarily designed to achieve which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnose clinical sexual dysfunctions as defined by the DSM-5.",
                "Explore sexual history, beliefs, and patterns to identify the 'sexual blueprint' without judgment.",
                "Immediately implement behavioral interventions to increase sexual frequency.",
                "Confront the partner on their lack of emotional responsiveness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Investigate phase focuses on uncovering the client's unique sexual history, beliefs, and systemic patterns to understand the root of their current experience, rather than jumping to diagnosis or immediate behavioral fixes."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to the Dual Control Model (Bancroft & Janssen), which is central to the 'Ignite' phase, sexual response is a balance between:",
            "options": [
                "Emotional safety and physical attraction.",
                "The Sexual Excitation System (SES) and the Sexual Inhibition System (SIS).",
                "Hormonal balance and psychological readiness.",
                "Spontaneous desire and responsive desire."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model posits that sexual response involves a balance between 'the gas' (SES) and 'the brakes' (SIS). Coaching in the Ignite phase often focuses on lowering the 'brakes' (inhibitions) rather than just increasing the 'gas' (stimuli)."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'Normalize' phase, a coach references that approximately what percentage of women experience some form of sexual dysfunction or concern globally?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",

                "Over 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Large-scale studies, including Laumann et al., suggest that approximately 40-45% of women and 31% of men report some form of sexual concern, making normalization a critical step in reducing shame."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "In the 'Trust' phase of the methodology, which attachment style is most likely to experience 'sexual deactivation' as a defense mechanism against intimacy?",

                "Disorganized Attachment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with a Dismissive-Avoidant attachment style often use sexual deactivation—withdrawing interest or distancing themselves—to maintain a sense of independence and avoid the vulnerability of deep intimacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "The 'Mindful Presence' phase utilizes interoception. Which statement best describes the role of interoception in sexual coaching?",

                "A cognitive technique used to distract the mind from performance anxiety."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. In the Mindful Presence phase, cultivating interoception helps clients move from 'spectatoring' (observing themselves) to 'embodiment' (feeling themselves)."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "In the 'Attune' phase, a coach works with a couple on 'Emotional Responsiveness.' According to Dr. Sue Johnson’s research, what are the three key components of A.R.E.?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A.R.E. stands for Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Engagement. These are the building blocks of secure attachment and are vital for the Attune phase of the methodology."

            "options": [
                "They are experiencing a high level of emotional catharsis and crying.",
                "They are able to process information and emotions without becoming hyper-aroused (panic) or hypo-aroused (numb).",
                "They are following all coaching instructions without questioning the coach.",
                "They have completely forgotten the details of the traumatic event."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance is the zone where a client can effectively process trauma. If they are hyper-aroused or hypo-aroused (dissociated), the 'Transform' phase cannot proceed safely."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "The 'Expand' phase focuses on 'The Orgasm Gap.' Recent research suggests that while 95% of heterosexual men usually or always orgasm during intercourse, only what percentage of heterosexual women do?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Frederick et al., 2018) consistently show an orgasm gap in heterosexual relationships, with women reporting orgasms approximately 65% of the time, often requiring clitoral stimulation not provided by intercourse alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder' (PGAD). According to the 'Specialty Applications' (M27) and scope of practice, what is the coach’s first responsibility?",
            "options": [
                "Provide mindfulness exercises to manage the sensations.",
                "Refer the client to a medical professional (Urologist or Neurologist) to rule out underlying physiological or neurological causes.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PGAD can have complex neurological, vascular, or pharmacological causes. A coach must ensure medical clearance before proceeding with psychological or behavioral coaching."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Basson's model acknowledges that for many (especially those in long-term relationships), desire doesn't always come first; it often emerges after physical or emotional stimulation (responsive desire)."

                "Any form of physical touch.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensate Focus Level 1 is designed to take the pressure off performance by prohibiting touch of 'nongenital' areas (including breasts) and removing the goal of arousal or orgasm."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transference and countertransference must be managed through supervision. To protect the client and professional integrity, a referral may be necessary if the attraction interferes with the coaching process."

            "options": [
                "Coaches work with healthy populations on goals/performance, while therapists treat diagnosed mental health disorders and deep trauma.",
                "Coaches can prescribe medication, while therapists cannot.",
                "Therapists only work with individuals, while coaches only work with couples.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The scope of practice is the key differentiator. Coaches focus on the present and future, goal-setting, and optimization for generally high-functioning clients, whereas therapists are licensed to treat clinical pathologies."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vaginismus involves the involuntary contraction of the pubococcygeus (PC) muscle group, making penetration painful or impossible. Coaching often involves 'Transforming' the fear response associated with this contraction."

                "It allows the coach to work fewer hours for the same pay.",
                "It provides 'Social Normalization,' reducing the client's sense of isolation and shame.",
                "It is easier to manage than one-on-one sessions.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group coaching leverages the power of 'Normalization' (the 'N' in the methodology), as clients realize they are not alone in their struggles, which significantly accelerates the healing process."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Schnarch's theory posits that intimacy requires 'differentiation'—the ability to be close to a partner while maintaining a clear sense of self. Without it, couples may 'fusion' and lose sexual tension."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration is about sustainability. A relapse prevention plan acknowledges that life stressors will occur and gives the client the autonomy and tools (from the I.N.T.I.M.A.T.E. method) to handle them independently."
