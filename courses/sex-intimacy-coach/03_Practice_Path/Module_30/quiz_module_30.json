            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-niche authority (e.g., coaching specifically for 'Intimacy after Prostate Cancer') positions the coach as a specialist, which reduces market competition and justifies a higher fee structure due to the specific, high-value transformation offered."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust legal infrastructure requires a clear distinction between coaching and therapy to mitigate the risk of practicing a regulated profession (like psychology or medicine) without a license."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket intimacy programs succeed by selling a specific result or transformation. Clients pay for the solution to their problem, not for the coach's time, which allows for better scaling and higher margins."
