            "question": "In the I.N.T.I.M.A.T.E. Method™ applied to group dynamics, what is the primary purpose of the 'N' (Normalization) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To establish strict rules and regulations for conduct",
                "To reduce individual shame through the process of 'Universalization'—realizing others share similar struggles",
                "To ensure all participants are at the same level of sexual experience",
                "To create a marketing hook for the program's sales page"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normalization in a group setting utilizes 'Universalization,' a core therapeutic factor where participants realize they are not alone in their experiences, which significantly lowers cortisol and shame-based resistance."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "According to the framework of Psychological Safety (Edmondson, 1999) discussed in Lesson 2, what is the most critical indicator of a 'Safe Container' in an intimacy workshop?",
            "options": [
                "Total silence during the facilitator's presentation",
                "Participants agreeing with everything the facilitator says",
                "The belief that one will not be humiliated or rejected for speaking up about vulnerable desires or boundaries",
                "The presence of physical security at the workshop venue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological safety is the shared belief that the group is safe for interpersonal risk-taking, which is essential for the deep vulnerability required in sex and intimacy coaching."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "When managing group energy in Lesson 3, the 'Bridge and Pivot' technique is specifically designed to handle which participant dynamic?",
            "options": [
                "The Silent Participant who refuses to speak",
                "The Scapegoat who is being blamed by the group",

                "The Facilitator's Pet who seeks constant validation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Bridge and Pivot' allows the facilitator to validate the Monopolizer's contribution ('The Bridge') and then redirect the focus back to the group or the curriculum ('The Pivot') without shaming the individual."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In the 'Arc of Transformation' for high-impact retreats (Lesson 4), what percentage of the program should ideally be dedicated to 'Integration' and 'Re-entry' preparation?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "20-25%",
                "Integration should only happen after the retreat ends"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into 'peak experiences' suggests that without 20-25% of time dedicated to integration, participants often experience a 'crash' or 'vulnerability hangover' upon returning to their daily lives."

            "id": "q34_5",

                "The fact that online programs are cheaper but less effective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The paradox is that people often share more deeply online (disinhibition) but the facilitator has fewer non-verbal cues (somatic data) to help the participant regulate that vulnerability."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "A 2023 study on enrollment mastery (Lesson 6) found that 'High-Ticket' intimacy programs ($2,000+) convert best when using which marketing strategy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For high-investment intimacy work, the 'Transformation-First' model (Discovery Calls) builds the necessary trust and 'pre-safety' required for a client to commit to a group experience."

                "The rapid growth of a program's membership"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social contagion in intimacy groups can lead to 'boundary drift,' where one participant's oversharing or rule-breaking encourages others to do the same, requiring firm facilitator intervention."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, a 'Net Promoter Score' (NPS) of +70 in an intimacy program is considered:",
            "options": [
                "Poor; the program needs immediate restructuring",
                "Average for the coaching industry",
                "World-class; indicating high levels of participant satisfaction and referral potential",
                "Impossible to achieve in the sex coaching niche"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the NPS metric (-100 to +100), any score above 70 is considered 'World Class,' reflecting exceptional program optimization and outcome delivery."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "During a retreat, a participant enters a state of 'Hyper-arousal' (flooding). Following the 'Window of Tolerance' model from Lesson 4, what is the facilitator's first step?",
            "options": [
                "Ask them to explain the childhood trauma causing the reaction",
                "Immediately use somatic grounding techniques to bring them back into their window of tolerance",
                "Ask the group to give them a hug to show support",
                "Ignore the behavior so as not to disrupt the group flow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a participant is flooded (hyper-aroused), cognitive processing stops. The facilitator must first use somatic grounding to stabilize the nervous system before any further coaching can occur."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "Lesson 3 describes 'Storming' as a natural phase of group development. What is the facilitator's role during this phase?",
            "options": [
                "To suppress all conflict to maintain a 'positive' environment",
                "To exit the group and let them figure it out themselves",
                "To hold the container steady, model healthy conflict resolution, and validate the underlying needs being expressed",
                "To identify the 'leader' of the rebellion and remove them from the program"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Storming is a necessary stage for authentic intimacy. The facilitator's role is to 'hold the heat' and guide the group through the conflict into the 'Norming' phase."
