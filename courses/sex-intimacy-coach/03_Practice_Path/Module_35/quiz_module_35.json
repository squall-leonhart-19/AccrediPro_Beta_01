                "Managing every administrative task to ensure quality control"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CEO mindset requires moving away from the linear exchange of time for money and focusing on 'high-leverage' activities that scale the business's impact and revenue independently of the coach's presence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket clients pay for results (transformation), not the amount of content (information). Overwhelming clients with too much data can actually decrease completion rates and perceived value."

            "explanation": "A Tripwire is a low-cost offer (typically $7-$47) designed to change the relationship from 'subscriber' to 'customer,' making them statistically more likely to purchase higher-ticket items later."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 is widely considered the 'sweet spot' for scaling. It indicates that for every dollar spent on marketing, the business generates three dollars in revenue over the client's lifetime."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increasing prices is the fastest way to create 'margin' (both financial and temporal). This allows the coach to work with fewer people for the same or more revenue, freeing up time to build the systems required for the next stage of scaling."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Originally coined by Hiroshi Mikitani (Rakuten), the Rule of 3 and 10 suggests that everything in a company—communication, payroll, scheduling, culture—changes fundamentally when you reach 3 and 10 people (and 30, 100, etc.)."
