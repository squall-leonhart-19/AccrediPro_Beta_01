            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neutralization (N) is the critical phase where stagnant energy or 'debris' is cleared from the field to ensure that the subsequent Calibration (C) phase is stable and effective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that chronic conditions respond best to a consistent, bi-weekly frequency over an 8-12 week period to allow for biofield restructuring and neuroplasticity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term mapping allows practitioners to identify cyclical or seasonal triggers in a client's biofield, leading to more proactive rather than reactive treatment planning."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "What is the ethical requirement regarding 'Discharge Planning' as outlined in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "Discharge should only be discussed when the client runs out of money",
                "Discharge planning should begin at the intake/initial treatment planning phase",
                "Practitioners should never discharge clients to ensure ongoing revenue",
                "Discharge is only necessary if a conflict of interest arises"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics dictate that discharge planning starts at the beginning of the relationship, establishing clear goals and criteria for when the professional intervention is no longer required."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acute imbalances require immediate stabilization and containment of the biofield to prevent further depletion, rather than deep investigative or transformative work."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "It guarantees a 100% cure rate for all diseases",
                "It provides a logical, replicable framework that prevents 'session drifting'",
                "It allows the practitioner to diagnose medical conditions",
