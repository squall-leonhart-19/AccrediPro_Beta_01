            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their own unresolved emotions or needs onto the client. Extending sessions for free due to protective urges indicates a breach of professional boundaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To stay within the legal scope of practice, practitioners must clearly state that energy healing is a complementary modality and not a replacement for professional medical or psychological care."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The power differential exists because clients often seek help in a state of vulnerability, while the practitioner is viewed as an authority figure with specialized knowledge."

            "id": "q22_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scientific integrity involves making nuanced, evidence-based claims that acknowledge the limitations of current research and avoid absolute 'cure' language."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
