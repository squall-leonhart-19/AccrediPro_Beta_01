            "question": "In Advanced Biofield Mapping (L1), what is the primary benefit of 'Multi-Layered Synthesis' over traditional linear mapping?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses exclusively on the physical body's symptoms.",
                "It identifies how disturbances in the mental body create 'shadow echoes' in the etheric layer simultaneously.",
                "It requires less time to perform than standard scanning.",
                "It eliminates the need for practitioner intuition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multi-Layered Synthesis allows the practitioner to see the interconnectedness of different layers, such as how a mental belief (mental body) manifests as a specific energetic depletion in the etheric layer."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When applying the 'Fluid Flow' non-linear protocol (L2), what is the most critical factor for determining the next intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Following the pre-set 7-step sequence regardless of client response.",
                "The chronological order of the client's trauma history.",
                "Real-time feedback from the client's autonomic nervous system and energetic resonance.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-linear protocols prioritize the 'Fluid Flow,' which relies on real-time feedback and resonance rather than a rigid, pre-determined sequence."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "A 'Recursive Blockage' in Synergistic Clearing (L3) is best described as:",

                "A simple depletion of energy in the root chakra.",
                "A self-reinforcing loop where emotional distress triggers a physical contraction, which then sustains the emotional state.",

                "An external attachment that is easily cleared in one session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recursive blockages are complex because they form a feedback loop across multiple layers (e.g., physical and emotional), making them more resistant to standard clearing techniques."

            "id": "q18_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies in bio-electromagnetics show that when a practitioner maintains a state of coherence, the client's heart rhythms often entrain to the practitioner's HRV pattern."

            "id": "q18_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The middle phase of a long-term strategy is focused on stabilization, ensuring that the energetic shifts become permanent fixtures in the client's life."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "When performing 'Cross-Modal Synthesis' (L6), why is it important to avoid 'Additive Layering'?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the session too expensive for the client.",
                "It can cause 'energetic noise' or sensory overload, diluting the primary healing intent.",
                "It is illegal in most jurisdictions.",
                "It requires the practitioner to have multiple degrees."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Additive layering (just adding more tools) can create interference. Cross-modal synthesis seeks a 'harmonic integration' where every tool supports a single, unified resonance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration requires mapping the release to the physical body and nervous system to prevent 'energetic bounce' or lack of grounding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most biologically active frequencies in the biofield, especially during healing and meditation, occur in the ELF range (0.5 to 30 Hz), which corresponds with EEG (brainwave) frequencies."
