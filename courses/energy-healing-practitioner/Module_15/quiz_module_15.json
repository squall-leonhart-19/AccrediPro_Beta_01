            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV serves as a primary marker for the Biofield-Nervous System Nexus because it reflects the bidirectional communication between the heart's electromagnetic field and the autonomic nervous system."

            "question": "The 'Advanced Lifeforce Activation (L)' technique (L2) aims to modulate immune resilience. According to the 2021 meta-analysis cited in the lesson, biofield therapies showed a statistically significant increase in which immune marker?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'L' phase focuses on immune resilience; studies (e.g., Fan et al., 2021) have shown that biofield interventions can increase sIgA levels, enhancing the first line of mucosal defense."

            "question": "When 'Neutralizing Deep-Seated Energetic Blocks (N)' (L3), what is the primary objective of identifying the 'Resonant Frequency' of a trauma block?",
            "options": [
                "To amplify the block so the client feels the pain more intensely",
                "To create a state of 'Destructive Interference' to dissolve the pattern",
                "To match the practitioner's vibration to the client's trauma",
                "To bypass the nervous system entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neutralization uses the physics principle of destructive interference, where an opposing wave frequency is introduced to cancel out the energetic signature of the block."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4 (The Physics of Resonance), the 'C' in the LANCEA protocol stands for Clearing. What physical phenomenon explains how a practitioner's coherent field can organize a client's chaotic field?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where two oscillating systems, such as the practitioner's and client's fields, synchronize to the more powerful or coherent frequency."

            "id": "q15_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hebb's Law is fundamental to the 'Empowering' phase, as it explains how repeated energetic states become physically wired into the client's neural architecture."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, during which window of the Circadian Rhythm is the 'Energetic Alignment (A)' most effective for clients suffering from chronic fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately before sleep (11 PM - 1 AM)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aligning energetic work with the natural morning cortisol peak (6-9 AM) leverages the body's highest state of physiological readiness and 'A' phase integration."

            "question": "In Lesson 7, the 'Field Sieve' technique is recommended for Practitioner Resilience. What is the primary purpose of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "To absorb the client's negative energy into the practitioner's body",
                "To filter out dissonant frequencies while remaining empathetic and present",
                "To block all energetic exchange between practitioner and client",
                "To increase the practitioner's ego-strength"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Field Sieve allows for 'compassionate detachment,' where the practitioner remains empathetic but does not 'take on' or store the client's energetic debris."

                "The practitioner felt the client was being stubborn.",
                "Observed a 15% increase in HRV via wearable device during the 'C' phase.",
                "The practitioner's intuition suggests the client has 'mother issues.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Objective findings must be measurable or observable. A 15% increase in HRV is a quantifiable data point, whereas feelings and intuitions are Subjective or Assessment-based."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Marcus' presents with chronic lower back pain and a history of repressed anger. During the 'N' phase, the practitioner identifies a localized field density. Which intervention is most appropriate based on Module 15 protocols?",

                "Immediate high-intensity activation of the 'L' phase",
                "Neutralizing the block using a harmonic resonance of the identified density",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' (Neutralizing) phase requires identifying the specific density and applying a harmonic resonance to dissolve the deep-seated block before further activation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In professional practice, documentation is the legal record of care. 'If it isn't written down, it didn't happen' is the standard for clinical and professional liability."
