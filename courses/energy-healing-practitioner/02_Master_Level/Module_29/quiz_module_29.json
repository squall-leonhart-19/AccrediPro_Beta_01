            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course (n=4,120) demonstrated that biofield therapies addressing ancestral blocks (Lesson 5) resulted in what percentage reduction in self-reported 'inherited anxiety' patterns?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual Sovereignty is the realization and practical application of the client's innate authority over their own energy field, moving them from a 'patient' role to a 'master' role."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Frequency Phase Shift often manifests as physiological changes (temperature drops, REM, or muscle twitches) as the physical body integrates high-frequency transmissions."
