            "question": "According to the criteria established by Grof & Grof (1989), which feature most accurately distinguishes a 'Spiritual Emergency' from a standard clinical psychosis?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of auditory hallucinations and disorganized speech patterns.",
                "A high level of reflexivity where the individual can observe their own process and maintain a 'witness' perspective.",
                "The complete absence of any physiological symptoms or autonomic nervous system arousal.",
                "The immediate resolution of symptoms through pharmacological intervention within 24 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual emergencies are characterized by the individual's ability to maintain some level of 'dual awareness' or reflexivity, acknowledging the extraordinary nature of the experience, whereas clinical psychosis often involves a total loss of insight."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the 'Titration' method is recommended for acute trauma stabilization. What is the primary energetic goal of this technique?",
            "options": [
                "To release the entire traumatic charge in a single, cathartic session.",
                "To bypass the emotional body and work exclusively on the causal layer of the aura.",
                "To process small increments of traumatic energy to prevent overwhelming the nervous system and re-traumatization.",
                "To induce a deep meditative state that suppresses the client's sympathetic nervous system response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves working with 'small bites' of traumatic material, ensuring the client stays within their Window of Tolerance to prevent the nervous system from flooding (hyper-arousal)."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "When managing complex multi-morbidity (Lesson 3), a practitioner observes a client's 'Allostatic Load' is critically high. What does this indicate about the client's energetic state?",
            "options": [
                "The client has achieved a state of permanent energetic homeostasis.",
                "The cumulative 'wear and tear' on the body-mind from chronic stress has depleted the adaptive reserves of the biofield.",
                "The client is experiencing a temporary 'healing crisis' that will resolve without intervention.",
                "The client's chakras are spinning too rapidly, causing physical inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the cumulative physiological and energetic cost of chronic exposure to fluctuating or heightened neural or neuroendocrine responses resulting from chronic stress."

                "To abruptly sever all connections to the physical world to speed up the process.",
                "To transfer the client's remaining life force to their primary caregivers.",
                "To gently facilitate the withdrawal of consciousness from the physical periphery toward the core, supporting a peaceful transition.",
                "To protect the practitioner from the 'death energy' present in the room."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energetic cord thinning is a supportive technique used in palliative care to help the soul/consciousness gently disengage from the physical vessel without the trauma of an abrupt break."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 5 indicates that practitioners working with trauma cases face a significant risk of Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). Which symptom is a hallmark of 'Vicarious Trauma' specifically?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Trauma is distinguished from burnout by its cognitive impact; it alters the practitioner's inner experience and world-view regarding safety, trust, and control."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client has been 'stuck' for 12 sessions with no symptomatic improvement despite various interventions. Lesson 6 suggests investigating 'Secondary Gain.' What does this term describe?",
            "options": [
                "The financial profit the practitioner makes from long-term clients.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the unconscious benefits (social, emotional, or practical) that a client derives from their symptoms, which can create a subconscious resistance to full recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical and professional standards dictate that safety is the absolute priority. In cases of active suicidal ideation with a plan, immediate professional mental health intervention is required, superseding energetic work."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) involves positive psychological change experienced as a result of struggling with highly challenging life circumstances, specifically manifesting as a greater appreciation for life and new possibilities."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex multi-morbidity cases involving PTSD, releasing the physical 'armoring' (as described by Reich and adapted to energetics) in the diaphragm is often the key to restoring systemic flow."

            "question": "When a practitioner uses 'Shielding' (Lesson 5), why is 'Filtering' often considered superior to 'Total Occlusion'?",
            "options": [
                "Total occlusion requires no energy to maintain, whereas filtering is difficult.",
                "Filtering allows the practitioner to remain empathically connected and receive intuitive data while blocking harmful frequencies.",
                "Total occlusion is only possible for practitioners with over 20 years of experience.",
                "Filtering is a physical technique, while occlusion is purely mental."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total occlusion (blocking everything) can lead to practitioner isolation and a loss of the 'empathic resonance' necessary for effective healing. Filtering allows for professional connection while maintaining energetic boundaries."
