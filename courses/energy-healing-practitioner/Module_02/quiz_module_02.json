            "question": "According to the 'Science of Vortices' (L1), what is the primary structural characteristic of a healthy chakra's toroidal field?",
            "options": [
                "A static, two-dimensional disk of light",
                "A double-vortex funnel that meets at the Shushumna Nadi",

                "A chaotic cloud of electromagnetic radiation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chakras function as toroidal fields, where energy flows in a double-vortex pattern, meeting at the central channel (Shushumna Nadi) to process and distribute prana."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, the Root Chakra (Muladhara) is linked to the adrenal glands. A 2022 study cited in the course showed that Root alignment protocols resulted in what statistically significant physiological change?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in bone density",
                "A 22% reduction in salivary cortisol levels",
                "A 40% increase in visual acuity",
                "A 10% decrease in heart rate variability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proper Root Chakra alignment is scientifically correlated with the stabilization of the HPA axis, resulting in an average 22% reduction in cortisol (the stress hormone)."

                "Solar Plexus and Throat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Root (security/physical structure) and Sacral (emotions/creativity) form the Lower Gate. Lower back pain and creative blocks are classic indicators of misalignment in these specific centers."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "The 'Heart Bridge' discussed in Lesson 3 is unique because it acts as the integration point between which two types of energy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Heart Chakra (Anahata) serves as the 'Bridge,' balancing the three lower physical chakras with the three upper spiritual chakras."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "During a diagnostic assessment using a pendulum (L5), a 'Counter-Clockwise' rotation typically signifies which energetic state?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal balance and flow",
                "A complete energetic blockage",
                "Energy being drawn out or 'leaking' from the center",
                "The chakra is in a state of 'Activation' but not 'Alignment'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While interpretations vary, the standard protocol taught in Lesson 5 identifies counter-clockwise rotation as a 'receptive' or 'releasing' state, often indicating energy depletion or leakage."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the 'Standard Ascension Protocol' for manual alignment (L6), why do practitioners always begin at the Root?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client is grounded before moving energy to higher centers",
                "Because the Root is the largest chakra in the body",
                "To prevent the client from falling asleep during the session",
                "Because the Crown cannot be touched until the end of the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grounding is the prerequisite for safe energy work. Starting at the Root ensures the biofield is stabilized to handle the higher frequencies of the upper triad."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which Solfeggio frequency is specifically utilized in Lesson 7 for resonating with the Third Eye (Ajna) to enhance intuition?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses the 'Piezoelectric Effect' in crystals. How is this scientific property applied in chakra alignment?",
            "options": [
                "Crystals melt when placed on the body",
                "Crystals convert mechanical pressure (from the biofield) into electrical frequency",
                "Crystals change color based on the client's mood",
                "Crystals eliminate the need for hand-sequencing protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The piezoelectric effect allows crystals to convert subtle mechanical/energetic pressure into a stable electrical frequency, which helps 'entrain' a misaligned chakra back to its correct resonance."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah' (L4), who suffered from chronic thyroid issues and a 'fear of speaking her truth,' which Upper Triad alignment was most effective?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah’s symptoms (thyroid and communication) are hallmark Throat Chakra issues. The protocol involved blue lace agate (resonance) and the 741 Hz frequency (cleansing/expression)."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the primary difference between 'Chakra Alignment' and 'Chakra Activation'?",
            "options": [
                "Alignment is for beginners; Activation is for masters",
                "Alignment focuses on structural balance; Activation focuses on increasing amplitude and power",
                "Alignment requires crystals; Activation requires sound",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alignment is the corrective process of bringing a chakra back to its proper spin and frequency. Activation is the subsequent step of increasing the volume or 'amplitude' of that energy once balance is achieved."
