            "question": "The 'Timing Hypothesis' resulting from the re-analysis of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data suggests that HRT is safest and most effective when initiated:",
            "options": [
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before the age of 60",
                "Only after a woman has been post-menopausal for at least 5 years",
                "At the very first sign of perimenopausal cycle irregularity, regardless of age",
                "Only after age 65 to prevent cognitive decline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Modern data indicates a 'window of opportunity' where the cardiovascular benefits outweigh risks when HRT is started within 10 years of menopause or before age 60."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Which delivery method of estrogen is preferred for women with a higher risk of blood clots (VTE) because it bypasses the 'first-pass metabolism' in the liver?",
            "options": [
                "Oral tablets",
                "Transdermal patches or gels",
                "Synthetic conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)",
                "Sublingual drops"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transdermal estrogen (patches, gels, sprays) does not increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the same way oral estrogen does because it avoids the initial processing by the liver."
        },

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client is confused about 'Bioidentical' hormones. As a coach, how should you clarify the difference between FDA-approved bioidenticals and custom-compounded bioidenticals?",
            "options": [
                "Custom-compounded hormones are safer because they are tailored to the individual's saliva tests.",
                "FDA-approved bioidenticals are chemically identical to human hormones and undergo rigorous safety testing, while compounded versions lack regulation and consistency.",
                "There is no difference; both are regulated by the same federal agencies.",
                "Only synthetic hormones are FDA-approved; all bioidenticals must be compounded."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FDA-approved bioidenticals (like micronized progesterone and 17β-estradiol) provide the same molecular structure as human hormones but with the safety, purity, and dosing consistency of regulated pharmaceuticals."

                "Age 52 with occasional migraines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A history of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer is a primary contraindication for systemic HRT. Other options like controlled hypertension are precautions but not necessarily absolute contraindications."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Fezolinetant (Veozah) is a newer non-hormonal pharmaceutical option. What is its primary mechanism of action for treating hot flashes?",
            "options": [
                "It increases systemic estrogen levels slightly.",
                "It acts as a sedative to help the client sleep through flashes.",
                "It is an NK3 receptor antagonist that blocks the neurokinin B signaling in the hypothalamus.",
                "It is an SSRI that increases serotonin availability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fezolinetant is a non-hormonal NK3 receptor antagonist that targets the KNDy neurons in the hypothalamus to regulate the body's temperature control center."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In the context of interpreting lab results, which Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level is typically indicative of menopause when measured on two separate occasions?",
            "options": [
                "FSH < 5 IU/L",
                "FSH between 10-20 IU/L",
                "FSH > 30 IU/L",
                "FSH is not used to determine menopause status"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While labs are a 'snapshot in time,' an FSH level consistently above 30 IU/L, combined with 12 months of amenorrhea, is the standard clinical marker for menopause."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Why is it clinically mandatory for a woman with an intact uterus to take a progestogen (progesterone) if she is using systemic estrogen therapy?",
            "options": [
                "To improve hair and nail growth",
                "To protect the endometrial lining from hyperplasia and the risk of uterine cancer",
                "To increase the effectiveness of the estrogen on hot flashes",
                "To prevent the 'first-pass' effect in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unopposed estrogen can cause the uterine lining to thicken excessively (hyperplasia), which significantly increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Progesterone counteracts this effect."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When helping a client prepare for a medical consultation regarding HRT, which strategy is most aligned with the AccrediPro coaching scope?",
            "options": [
                "Telling the client exactly which dosage of estradiol to demand from their doctor.",
                "Reviewing the client's symptom log and helping them prioritize their top three concerns to discuss with the physician.",

            "question": "A 2017 long-term follow-up of the WHI participants (n=27,347) found what regarding 'all-cause mortality' for women who had used HRT?",
            "options": [
                "HRT users had a 50% higher mortality rate.",
                "There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the HRT and placebo groups over 18 years.",
                "Only women who used synthetic progestins had higher mortality.",
                "HRT use led to a significant increase in Alzheimer's-related deaths."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 18-year follow-up data published in JAMA (2017) showed that HRT use was not associated with increased all-cause, cardiovascular, or cancer mortality."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes 'Micronized Progesterone' (e.g., Prometrium)?",

                "A synthetic progestin often associated with higher breast cancer risks in the WHI study.",
                "A form of progesterone that is identical to the hormone produced by the human ovaries and is suspended in oil for better absorption.",
                "An estrogen-only cream used for vaginal atrophy.",
                "A testosterone-derived compound used to treat libido issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micronized progesterone is the bioidentical form of progesterone. It is often preferred in modern HRT protocols because it has a better safety profile regarding breast health and mood compared to synthetic progestins."
