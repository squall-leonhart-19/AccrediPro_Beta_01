            "question": "The 'estrobolome' refers to a specific collection of enteric bacteria capable of doing which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Synthesizing progesterone from dietary fiber",
                "Metabolizing and recirculating estrogens via the production of beta-glucuronidase",
                "Increasing the absorption of calcium in the small intestine",
                "Producing cortisol in response to low estrogen levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is the aggregate of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing and recirculating estrogens. These bacteria produce beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."

            "question": "During the first five years of menopause, what is the average annual rate of bone density loss observed in women not receiving intervention?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% per year",
                "1% to 2% per year",
                "5% to 7% per year",
                "10% per year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that women lose approximately 1% to 2% of their bone mineral density (BMD) annually during the first five years following the final menstrual period due to the rapid decline in estrogen."

            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis in cardiovascular health suggests that Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has the most protective effect when started:",
            "options": [
                "At least 20 years after the onset of menopause",
                "Only after a cardiovascular event has occurred",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "Regardless of age, as long as the patient is symptomatic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis posits that HRT is cardioprotective when initiated close to the onset of menopause (within 10 years or before age 60) before significant atherosclerosis has developed."

            "question": "In Lesson 4, we discussed neuro-inflammation. Which mechanism explains why lower estrogen levels contribute to 'brain fog'?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen decline leads to over-activation of microglia and a 30% reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism",
                "Estrogen decline causes an immediate increase in serotonin production",
                "The brain switches from using glucose to using ketones exclusively",
                "Estrogen loss causes the blood-brain barrier to thicken significantly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is neuroprotective; its decline leads to the activation of microglia (the brain's immune cells) which promotes inflammation. Simultaneously, there is a documented reduction (up to 30%) in the brain's ability to metabolize glucose for energy."

            "question": "How does estrogen influence insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle?",
            "options": [
                "It inhibits the uptake of glucose to preserve it for the brain",
                "It promotes the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane",
                "It increases insulin resistance to help store fat for the winter",
                "It has no measurable effect on skeletal muscle metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen enhances insulin sensitivity by promoting the translocation of GLUT4 (glucose transporter type 4) to the cell membrane in skeletal muscle, allowing for efficient glucose uptake."

            "question": "Why might a woman in perimenopause experience hypothyroid symptoms despite having 'normal' TSH levels?",
            "options": [
                "High estrogen levels can increase Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), which binds to thyroid hormones and reduces the 'Free' available T4/T3",
                "Thyroid hormones are only active when estrogen is completely absent",
                "The thyroid gland stops producing TSH during menopause",
                "Perimenopause causes the body to become immune to thyroid medication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Fluctuating or high estrogen levels can stimulate the liver to produce more Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) and Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG). This increases the bound (inactive) portion of thyroid hormones, potentially leaving less 'Free' T3/T4 available for the cells."

            "options": [
                "A localized skin infection",
                "A narrowing of the temperature range in which the hypothalamus perceives the body is 'comfortable'",
                "The body's attempt to burn more calories through heat",
                "A result of drinking too much cold water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hot flashes are triggered by a narrowing of the thermoneutral zone in the hypothalamus. Small fluctuations in core body temperature that previously wouldn't trigger a response now cross the threshold for sweating or shivering."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The loss of estrogen leads to a decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics (energy production) and an increase in the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), contributing to cellular aging and metabolic dysfunction."
