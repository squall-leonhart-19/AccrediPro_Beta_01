            "question": "When critically appraising the 2002 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings, what was the reported absolute risk increase of breast cancer for women in the Estrogen + Progestin group?",
            "options": [
                "8 additional cases per 10,000 person-years",
                "26 additional cases per 1,000 person-years",
                "1.2 additional cases per 100 person-years",
                "15 additional cases per 10,000 person-years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While the relative risk was reported as a 26% increase, the absolute risk was actually quite low, amounting to only 8 additional cases per 10,000 women per year of use."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "The 'Timing Hypothesis,' supported by the ELITE and KEEPS trials, suggests that HRT provides cardiovascular benefits under which condition?",
            "options": [
                "When initiated at least 20 years after the onset of menopause",
                "When initiated within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "Only when using synthetic progestins rather than micronized progesterone",
                "Only when administered via high-dose oral tablets"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Timing Hypothesis posits that the effects of HRT on the cardiovascular system depend on the health of the endothelium at the time of initiation; starting early (within 10 years of menopause) is generally cardioprotective."

            "id": "q19_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the decline in estradiol leads to a shift in lipoprotein lipase activity, favoring fat storage in the abdominal (visceral) region rather than the hips and thighs."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the course examined the Mediterranean diet's impact on menopausal inflammation. Which specific biomarker showed the most significant reduction?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical trials consistently show that adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet reduces C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a key marker of systemic low-grade inflammation common in menopause."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Only about 30-50% of the Western population possesses the gut microbiota (such as S. isoflavonitrophus) necessary to produce Equol, the most potent metabolite of soy isoflavones."

            "id": "q19_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brain imaging studies show that the menopausal transition is associated with a significant drop (20-25%) in glucose metabolism, which can trigger symptoms like brain fog and hot flashes."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "When a study reports a 'Hazard Ratio' (HR) of 0.75 for a specific intervention, what does this indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The intervention increased the risk by 75%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Hazard Ratio less than 1.0 indicates a reduction in risk. An HR of 0.75 represents a 25% reduction in the risk of the event occurring compared to the control group."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen has natural anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; its decline during menopause leads to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha."
