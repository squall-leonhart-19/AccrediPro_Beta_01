            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "When performing a differential diagnosis between perimenopause and thyroid dysfunction, which symptom is most uniquely indicative of hypothyroidism rather than standard perimenopause?",
            "options": [
                "Brain fog and difficulty concentrating",
                "Thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows (Hertoghe's sign)",
                "Irregular menstrual cycles",
                "Sleep disturbances and night sweats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While brain fog and cycle changes occur in both, the thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows is a specific clinical sign of hypothyroidism (Hertoghe's sign) not typically associated with estrogen depletion alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the case of surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy), what is the typical percentage drop in circulating testosterone levels within the first 24 hours post-surgery?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike natural menopause where the ovarian stroma continues to produce androgens, surgical menopause causes an immediate and abrupt 50% drop in circulating testosterone, leading to significant libido and energy issues."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Metabolic Resistance' despite a 500-calorie deficit and daily cardio. Based on Module 16, L3, what is the most likely physiological cause?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive protein intake causing gluconeogenesis",
                "Adaptive thermogenesis and anabolic resistance due to estrogen loss",
                "A lack of steady-state aerobic exercise",
                "Consuming too many cruciferous vegetables affecting the thyroid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen loss reduces insulin sensitivity and muscle protein synthesis. Coupled with 'adaptive thermogenesis' from chronic calorie restriction, the body becomes resistant to traditional weight loss methods."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's study of the 'High-Stress Executive,' how does chronic cortisol elevation specifically exacerbate progesterone deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol blocks progesterone receptors in the uterus",
                "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' diverts precursors toward cortisol instead of progesterone",
                "High cortisol increases the rate of progesterone excretion in urine",
                "Cortisol stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen, masking progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes survival (cortisol) over reproduction (progesterone), using the common precursor pregnenolone to synthesize cortisol, often termed the 'Pregnenolone Steal'."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to the management guidelines for Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), how long should HRT ideally be maintained?",
            "options": [
                "For 2-3 years until symptoms stabilize",
                "Until the average age of natural menopause (approx. 51-52)",
                "Only until the client reaches age 40",
                "HRT is contraindicated in POI due to long-term stroke risk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "International guidelines recommend that women with POI continue HRT until at least the average age of natural menopause to protect bone density and cardiovascular health."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses the 'Inflammation Connection.' Why do autoimmune conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis often flare during the perimenopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen is purely pro-inflammatory and its fluctuation triggers the immune system",
                "The drop in estrogen leads to a shift in T-helper cell balance (Th1/Th2) and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines",
                "Progesterone is the primary cause of joint destruction",
                "Menopause causes a total shutdown of the immune system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen has immunomodulatory effects. Its decline triggers an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), which can exacerbate underlying autoimmune conditions."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "When addressing cognitive decline fears (Lesson 7), what does the research suggest regarding 'Menopausal Brain Fog' vs. early-onset Alzheimer’s?",
            "options": [
                "Brain fog is permanent and leads directly to dementia in 80% of cases",
                "Brain fog is characterized by a temporary decrease in glucose metabolism in the brain that often stabilizes post-menopause",
                "There is no physiological difference between the two",
                "Brain fog is purely psychological and not related to estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroimaging shows that the menopausal transition involves a 'remodeling' of the brain with temporary metabolic shifts; for most women, cognitive function stabilizes once the brain adapts to the low-estrogen environment."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the Mastery Case Study (L8), which component of the THRIVE method addresses the 'Intake' requirement for a client with significant sarcopenia?",
            "options": [
                "Reducing total daily calories to 1,200",
                "Increasing protein to 1.2–1.5g per kg of body weight and timing intake around resistance training",
                "Implementing a 20-hour daily fast",
                "Eliminating all dietary fats to improve insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To combat anabolic resistance and sarcopenia in post-menopause, the THRIVE method emphasizes higher protein thresholds (1.2–1.5g/kg) and strategic nutrient timing."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Which lab marker is most critical to monitor in a POI client to ensure bone protection, as discussed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Estradiol levels (aiming for a specific therapeutic range)",
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Fasting Glucose",
                "Liver Enzymes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In POI, monitoring serum estradiol is vital to ensure the HRT dose is high enough to achieve physiological levels necessary for bone resorption inhibition, unlike standard menopause where 'lowest effective dose' is the rule."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A high-stress executive client is experiencing 'wired but tired' nights and weight gain around the midsection. Which intervention should be prioritized first in the THRIVE method?",
            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) to burn fat",
                "Strict ketogenic dieting",
                "Restoring the HPA axis through 'Rest' (sleep hygiene and nervous system regulation)",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to combat daytime fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For the burnt-out executive, adding HIIT or restrictive dieting can further spike cortisol and worsen metabolic resistance. Restoring the HPA axis (Rest) is the foundational priority to lower systemic inflammation."
