            "question": "In the THRIVE Matrix, which 'pillar' serves as the primary regulator for the 'Cross-Pillar Synergy' between metabolic rate and systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "The Hormonal/Endocrine Pillar",
                "The Nutritional/Micronutrient Pillar",
                "The Circadian/Sleep Pillar",
                "The Cognitive/Mindset Pillar"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Circadian Pillar acts as the primary regulator because sleep deprivation and circadian misalignment are the fastest drivers of both insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-6 and TNF-alpha)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated a 22% greater reduction in visceral fat when synergistic interventions (movement + nutrition) were applied, highlighting the importance of the Cross-Pillar approach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV indicates autonomic nervous system strain, which frequently precedes an increase in the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The loop is driven by the decline in GABAergic signaling due to low progesterone, combined with the HPA-axis dysregulation (high cortisol) that characterizes the menopausal transition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Before fat loss can occur efficiently, the coach must stabilize the internal environment by normalizing blood sugar and reducing the inflammatory load that causes metabolic resistance."

                "Lack of cardiovascular variety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis, compounded by an overactive HPA-axis (stress response), can cause the body to 'defend' its current weight, requiring a shift to 'Maintenance' or 'Recovery' weeks."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Upstream mapping involves looking at a symptom (e.g., fatigue) and tracing it back through the THRIVE Matrix to identify the root driver (e.g., iron deficiency, poor sleep hygiene, or thyroid dysfunction)."
