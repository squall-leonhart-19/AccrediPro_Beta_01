            "question": "According to the Integrative Assessment Framework (L1), which physiological pillar must be stabilized first before addressing advanced fat loss or hormonal optimization?",
            "options": [
                "Micronutrient density and supplementation",
                "Advanced lipid and cardiovascular markers",
                "Circadian rhythm and HPA-axis regulation",
                "Bone mineral density and collagen synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The framework prioritizes the 'Foundation' phase, which focuses on stabilizing the HPA-axis and circadian rhythms. Without addressing sleep and stress (cortisol), metabolic and hormonal interventions often fail due to systemic inflammation."

            "question": "In the THRIVE Roadmap sequencing (L2), why is 'Metabolic Priming' scheduled as Phase 2, prior to 'Advanced Hormonal Support'?",
            "options": [
                "To lower the financial cost of the overall program",
                "To ensure insulin sensitivity is optimized for better hormone receptor responsiveness",
                "To allow the client time to find a qualified OBGYN",
                "To focus exclusively on caloric restriction before adding supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Priming ensures that insulin and blood glucose are stabilized. High insulin levels can interfere with hormone receptor sensitivity, making HRT or herbal support less effective if the metabolic environment is suboptimal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Menopausal women require higher protein (1.2-1.6g/kg) than the standard RDA to overcome anabolic resistance caused by declining estrogen levels."

                "Moderate intensity swimming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIRT provides the necessary mechanical loading and osteogenic stimulus required to maintain or improve BMD during the rapid bone loss phase of menopause."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity work helps clients move away from the loss of fertility toward the 'Wise Woman' or 'Sage' archetype, emphasizing wisdom, autonomy, and a new phase of personal power."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "When monitoring data (L6), a coach notices a consistent 15% drop in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and a 5bpm increase in Resting Heart Rate (RHR) over 14 days. This likely indicates:",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A drop in HRV combined with an increase in RHR is a classic indicator of autonomic nervous system stress, suggesting the client is not recovering from the current protocol intensity."

            "options": [
                "It becomes much wider, lasting up to 24 hours",
                "It becomes narrower, requiring protein intake closer to the exercise bout (30-90 mins)",
                "It disappears entirely due to estrogen loss",
                "It only applies if the woman is taking HRT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, menopausal women benefit from more precise nutrient timing, specifically consuming high-quality protein (leucine-rich) within 30-90 minutes post-exercise."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MED strategies help clients maintain consistency during high-stress periods, preventing the 'all-or-nothing' collapse and building long-term resilience."
