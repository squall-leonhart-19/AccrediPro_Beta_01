            "question": "When utilizing the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) to track clinical symptoms, which total score threshold typically indicates 'severe' impairment requiring intensive intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A total score of 10 or higher",
                "A total score of 17 or higher",
                "A total score of 22 or higher",
                "A total score of 35 or higher"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), a validated tool used globally, a total score of 0-4 is considered little to no symptoms, 5-8 is mild, 9-16 is moderate, and 17 or higher indicates severe symptoms."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In metabolic risk stratification for postmenopausal women, which lipid marker is currently considered a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular events than LDL-C alone?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)",
                "VLDL-C",
                "Non-HDL Cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles. Research indicates that in the estrogen-deficient state of menopause, LDL-C can be misleading, whereas ApoB provides a more precise assessment of cardiovascular risk."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client's hormone panel shows an FSH of 35 IU/L and an LH of 40 IU/L, but she is still experiencing irregular cycles. How should a coach interpret this according to advanced hormone interpretation guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "She is definitively postmenopausal.",
                "She is in the late menopausal transition (perimenopause).",
                "She has Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).",
                "The test is invalid due to the LH being higher than FSH."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, FSH levels often fluctuate and can exceed 25-30 IU/L even while cycles continue. Menopause is only clinically confirmed after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, regardless of a single FSH reading."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is the primary marker for systemic inflammation. Levels between 1.0 and 3.0 mg/L indicate moderate risk, while levels above 3.0 mg/L indicate high systemic inflammation, often seen as estrogen declines."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "According to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) used in Lesson 5, what global score is the 'cutoff' point to distinguish 'good' sleepers from 'poor' sleepers?",
            "options": [
                "A score of >3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PSQI uses a global score of >5 to yield a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% in distinguishing good and poor sleepers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A MoCA score of 26-30 is considered normal. A score between 18-25 is generally categorized as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is a critical window for intervention in menopausal women."

            "question": "A client presents with a Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) of 0.58. Based on the cardiovascular risk stratification lesson, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Low risk; no intervention needed.",
                "Healthy for her age group.",
                "Increased cardiometabolic risk; intervention recommended.",
                "Extremely high risk; immediate medical emergency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A WHtR of >0.5 is a significant predictor of visceral fat accumulation and increased cardiometabolic risk, even if the client's BMI is within the 'normal' range."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which gut health biomarker, if elevated, suggests that estrogen is being 'recycled' back into the bloodstream rather than excreted, potentially worsening estrogen dominance symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Calprotectin",
                "Secretory IgA",

                "Zonulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by the estrobolome (gut bacteria) that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed. High levels lead to excess estrogen recirculating in the body."
