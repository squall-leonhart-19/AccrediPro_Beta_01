            "question": "A Menopause Support Coach is working with a client who asks for a specific dosage recommendation for Micronized Progesterone. Which action best adheres to the professional Scope of Practice?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest the standard starting dose of 100mg based on clinical guidelines.",
                "Provide a list of common dosages used in clinical trials while stating you cannot prescribe.",
                "Explain that dosage is a clinical decision and provide a 'Doctor Discussion Guide' to help the client ask their physician.",
                "Recommend a high-quality over-the-counter progesterone cream as a safer alternative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never recommend specific dosages or prescribe. Facilitating the client-provider relationship through a discussion guide maintains the coaching boundary while providing high-level support."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "When discussing Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) with a client, what is the primary ethical obligation of the coach regarding 'Informed Choice'?",
            "options": [
                "To convince the client that HRT is the gold standard for symptom management.",
                "To present evidence-based benefits and risks impartially, ensuring the client has the tools to make their own decision.",
                "To discourage HRT use if the client has any family history of breast cancer.",
                "To provide the client with a list of pharmacies where they can purchase HRT without a prescription."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical coaching involves neutrality and evidence-based education. Coaches empower clients to make informed choices by presenting data from sources like the WHI 13-year follow-up, rather than pushing a personal agenda."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "According to data privacy standards (GDPR/HIPAA) discussed in Lesson 3, what is a requirement for coaches using digital symptom-tracking apps with clients?",
            "options": [
                "Coaches must own the data generated by the client.",
                "Data must be stored in a public cloud for easy access.",
                "Clients must provide explicit, 'granular' consent for how their health data is collected, stored, and shared.",
                "Confidentiality is not required if the coach is not a licensed medical doctor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even non-clinical coaches must adhere to high privacy standards. Granular consent ensures the client knows exactly what happens to their sensitive health data (e.g., menstrual cycle or vasomotor symptom logs)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A 2023 analysis of social media menopause content found that a significant percentage of 'viral' advice was scientifically inaccurate. How should a coach ethically handle a client bringing in a 'hormone balancing' supplement seen on TikTok?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client that all social media advice is dangerous and should be ignored.",
                "Use the 'Hierarchy of Evidence' to help the client evaluate the claims against peer-reviewed meta-analyses.",
                "Recommend the supplement if it has many positive five-star reviews on Amazon.",
                "Ignore the topic to avoid a confrontation with the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice involves teaching clients critical thinking. Comparing social media claims against high-level evidence (like Cochrane Reviews or NAMS position statements) protects the client from misinformation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Research (such as the SWAN study) indicates that Black women often experience menopause earlier and with more severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) than white women. What is an ethical requirement for coaches working with diverse populations?",
            "options": [
                "Applying the same 'standard' protocol to all clients regardless of ethnicity.",
                "Practicing cultural humility and acknowledging the 'weathering' effect of systemic stressors on biological aging.",
                "Focusing exclusively on biological factors while ignoring socio-economic determinants of health.",
                "Assuming that all ethnic groups experience the same duration of the menopausal transition (average 7.4 years)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural humility requires coaches to understand that menopause is not a monolithic experience. Acknowledging disparities in symptom severity and the impact of systemic stressors is vital for ethical, personalized care."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A coach receives a 15% commission for every client they refer to a specific private hormone testing lab. What is the most ethical way to manage this conflict of interest?",
            "options": [
                "Only refer clients who specifically ask for testing.",
                "Do not mention the commission, as it is a standard business practice.",
                "Disclose the affiliate relationship clearly and provide at least two other non-affiliated testing options.",
                "Stop using the lab entirely, as all commissions are inherently unethical."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transparency is the hallmark of professional integrity. Disclosing the conflict of interest and providing alternatives (choice) preserves the client's trust and autonomy."

        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "A 55-year-old client who has been post-menopausal for two years reports a small amount of 'spotting' or light vaginal bleeding. What is the ethically mandated response?",

                "Reassure her that light spotting is common due to vaginal atrophy.",
                "Suggest she increase her intake of phytoestrogens to stabilize the uterine lining.",
                "Advise her that post-menopausal bleeding is a 'Red Flag' requiring urgent medical evaluation to rule out malignancy.",
                "Wait two weeks to see if the bleeding recurs before taking any action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal bleeding (PMB) is a critical clinical red flag. Statistically, while often benign, it carries a ~10% risk of endometrial cancer and must be referred to a physician immediately."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical risk of 'The Ethics of Empowerment' when a coach encourages a client to be their own health advocate?",
            "options": [
                "The client might become too knowledgeable for their doctor.",
                "The coach might inadvertently encourage the client to ignore professional medical advice in favor of 'intuition'.",
                "The client might stop paying for coaching services.",
                "The doctor might refuse to see the client if they ask too many questions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While empowerment is a goal, it must be balanced with professional standards. Coaches must ensure that 'self-advocacy' does not cross into 'medical non-compliance' or the rejection of evidence-based clinical care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Informed Consent,' which of the following must be discussed before beginning a coaching relationship?",

                "The names of other clients the coach is currently seeing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent in coaching requires the client to understand the 'nature and limitations' of the service, specifically that coaching is supportive/educational and not a substitute for medical diagnosis or treatment."

            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "A coach notices a client is showing signs of clinical depression, including suicidal ideation, which the client attributes to 'menopausal mood swings.' What is the coach's ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust the client's lifestyle plan to include more exercise and Vitamin D.",
                "Explain that mood swings are a normal part of the perimenopausal transition.",
                "Immediately activate an emergency referral pathway to a mental health professional or crisis line.",
                "Research the best SSRIs for menopause to discuss at the next session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation is an immediate red flag that falls outside the coaching scope of practice. The ethical and legal priority is client safety through immediate referral to emergency or specialized mental health services."
