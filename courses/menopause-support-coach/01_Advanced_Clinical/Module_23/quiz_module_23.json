            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "In precision biometrics, what does a significant and consistent drop in nocturnal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) often precede in perimenopausal clients?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in progesterone levels",
                "A vasomotor symptom (hot flash) flare or systemic inflammatory stress",
                "The onset of the follicular phase",
                "A state of optimal parasympathetic recovery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced biometric tracking shows that a drop in HRV often indicates autonomic nervous system strain, which frequently precedes the onset of hot flashes or indicates poor recovery from hormonal fluctuations."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "What is the primary role of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase within the estrobolome?",
            "options": [
                "Deconjugating estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream",
                "Binding estrogen to fiber for permanent excretion",
                "Converting testosterone into estradiol via aromatization",
                "Producing Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) to lower gut pH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid; when this occurs, 'active' estrogen is reabsorbed rather than excreted, potentially leading to estrogen dominance or recycling."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in menopausal women, what is the recommended protein distribution per meal to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams per meal",
                "20 grams per meal, regardless of weight",
                "0.4 - 0.55g/kg per meal (typically 30-40g)",
                "Protein should only be consumed once per day in the evening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance caused by declining estrogen, menopausal women require a higher leucine threshold (found in 30-40g of high-quality protein) to trigger the mTOR pathway for muscle repair."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "In chronobiology, the 'Anchoring' technique for resetting the circadian rhythm involves which of the following?",

                "Taking 10mg of melatonin at the same time every night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anchoring the wake-up time is the most effective way to stabilize the master clock (Suprachiasmatic Nucleus) and regulate the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)."

            "id": "q23_6",

            "options": [
                "Sleep Hygiene Education",
                "Stimulus Control Therapy",
                "Caffeine Elimination",
                "White Noise Generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control involves leaving the bed if not asleep within 20 minutes, ensuring the brain associates the bed only with sleep and intimacy, not anxiety or wakefulness."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "According to research on osteogenic loading, what is the 'Minimum Essential Strain' (MES) required to trigger new bone mineral density growth in the femoral neck?",

                "8.5x body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "Why is St. John’s Wort often contraindicated for women on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or oral contraceptives?",
            "options": [
                "It causes excessive drowsiness",
                "It is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme, which accelerates the clearance of hormones",
                "It increases the absorption of estrogen to toxic levels",
                "It blocks the uptake of Vitamin D in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort induces the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which metabolizes estrogen and progesterone more quickly, potentially rendering HRT or contraceptives ineffective."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A client using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) notices significant glucose spikes followed by 'crashes' (hypoglycemia) at night. What menopausal symptom is most likely to be triggered by these nocturnal crashes?",
            "options": [
                "Joint pain",
                "Night sweats and sleep fragmentation",
                "Vaginal dryness",
                "Increased hair shedding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nocturnal hypoglycemia triggers a counter-regulatory surge of cortisol and adrenaline to raise blood sugar, which simultaneously activates the sweat glands and wakes the client."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "When applying Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to menopause coaching, what is the primary goal of 'Cognitive Defusion'?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate all negative thoughts about aging",
                "To change the content of thoughts from negative to positive",
                "To create space between the person and their thoughts, seeing them as 'just words' rather than facts",
                "To distract the client from physical pain using visualization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion helps clients observe their thoughts (e.g., 'I am falling apart') without being 'fused' or controlled by them, reducing the emotional impact of the thought."
