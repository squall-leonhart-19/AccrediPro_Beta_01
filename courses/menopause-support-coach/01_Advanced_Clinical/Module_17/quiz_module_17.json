            "question": "In the context of autoimmune conditions, how does the Th1/Th2 immune balance typically shift during the low-estrogen state of menopause?",
            "options": [
                "There is a shift toward Th2 dominance, often improving cellular immunity",
                "There is a shift toward Th1 dominance, which may exacerbate conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis",
                "Estrogen loss leads to a total suppression of both Th1 and Th2 pathways",
                "The immune system remains static; only inflammatory markers like CRP change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen typically has an immunomodulatory effect. Its decline often leads to a shift toward Th1 (pro-inflammatory) dominance, which is why many women experience flares in Th1-mediated conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis during perimenopause."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to diagnostic criteria for Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), which of the following is required for a formal diagnosis in a woman under 40?",
            "options": [
                "One FSH reading above 25 IU/L and absence of menses for 3 months",
                "Two FSH readings >40 IU/L taken at least 4-6 weeks apart and 4 months of amenorrhea",
                "A single AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) test showing 'undetectable' levels",
                "Presence of hot flashes and a surgical history of unilateral oophorectomy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "POI is characterized by oligo/amenorrhea for at least 4 months and elevated FSH levels (typically >40 IU/L) demonstrated on two occasions at least 4-6 weeks apart in women under age 40."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Which physiological change is unique to surgical menopause compared to natural menopause?",
            "options": [
                "A gradual 5-year decline in progesterone levels",
                "An immediate 50% reduction in circulating testosterone and 90% drop in estradiol",
                "The preservation of the 'androgen cushion' provided by the ovaries",
                "A lower risk of bone density loss due to the absence of a transition period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Surgical menopause (oophorectomy) causes an abrupt hormonal 'crash,' including the loss of the ovarian contribution to testosterone (approx. 50%) and a near-total loss of estradiol overnight, leading to more severe symptoms."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Why do women with ADHD often report a significant worsening of executive function during the perimenopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone increases dopamine clearance in the prefrontal cortex",
                "Estrogen acts as a modulator of dopamine; declining levels reduce dopamine receptor sensitivity",
                "ADHD medication becomes toxic when combined with estrogen replacement therapy",
                "Neurodivergent individuals are simply more sensitive to the 'brain fog' of hot flashes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen promotes dopamine synthesis and decreases its degradation. As estrogen drops, dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex weakens, significantly exacerbating ADHD symptoms like emotional dysregulation and lack of focus."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In clients with Histamine Intolerance or MCAS, what is the specific relationship between estrogen and mast cells?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen stabilizes mast cells and prevents the release of histamine",
                "Estrogen stimulates mast cells to release histamine, and histamine stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen",
                "Progesterone is the primary trigger for histamine release, while estrogen is neutral",
                "Histamine degrades estrogen, leading to a premature state of menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "There is a 'vicious cycle' where estrogen triggers mast cell degranulation (releasing histamine), and histamine then stimulates the LH-mediated production of more estrogen in the ovaries."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client presents with 'treatment-resistant weight gain' and signs of metabolic inflexibility. What does the 'Crossover Point' refer to in her metabolic testing?",
            "options": [
                "The age at which a woman's BMR drops by 20% (usually age 52)",
                "The point where the body shifts from using primarily fats to primarily carbohydrates for fuel as intensity increases",
                "The moment HRT begins to reverse insulin resistance",
                "The transition from subcutaneous fat storage to visceral fat storage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic inflexibility often manifests as an early 'Crossover Point,' where the individual cannot efficiently oxidize fats at low intensities and relies prematurely on glucose, making weight loss difficult despite calorie restriction."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Which complex sleep disorder is frequently misdiagnosed as 'menopause insomnia' but is actually caused by the loss of progesterone’s respiratory drive?",
            "options": [
                "Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)",
                "Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)",
                "Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder",
                "Psychophysiological Insomnia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is a potent respiratory stimulant. Its decline in menopause reduces the tone of the upper airway muscles, leading to a 3x increase in the risk of sleep-disordered breathing like UARS or OSA."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In high-performance executive burnout scenarios, why is 'standard' HRT sometimes insufficient without addressing the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "High cortisol levels can downregulate estrogen receptors, making the HRT less effective",
                "Executive women have a genetic resistance to exogenous hormones",
                "HRT is contraindicated for anyone with a high-stress job",
                "Cortisol converts all supplemental estrogen into testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels can lead to 'hormone resistance' by downregulating the expression and sensitivity of estrogen receptors, meaning symptoms may persist even with therapeutic hormone levels."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 34-year-old client with POI is hesitant about HRT. Based on clinical data, what is the primary long-term risk of untreated POI that the coach should discuss?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% increase in the risk of skin hyperpigmentation",
                "Significantly increased risk of early-onset dementia and a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality",
                "There are no long-term risks; POI is simply an early natural transition",
                "Increased risk of twins if she later chooses IVF"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Untreated POI is associated with severe long-term health consequences due to prolonged estrogen deficiency, including significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline compared to women who reach menopause at the average age."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When working with a client experiencing both Histamine Intolerance and Menopause, which dietary strategy is often most effective during the 'Luteal Phase' (or its equivalent in perimenopause)?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing fermented foods like sauerkraut to improve gut health",
                "A high-protein, high-spinach ketogenic diet",
                "A low-histamine approach combined with supporting DAO enzyme production",
                "Intermittent fasting for 20 hours a day to suppress mast cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-histamine approach is crucial because the hormonal fluctuations (especially estrogen peaks) can overwhelm the body's ability to clear histamine via the DAO enzyme, leading to 'histamine flares' that mimic or worsen menopause symptoms."
