            "question": "Which neurotransmitter system is most significantly impacted by the decline of estradiol, leading to the 'window of vulnerability' for depression in perimenopause?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin (5-HT) synthesis and receptor sensitivity",
                "GABAergic inhibition of the prefrontal cortex",
                "Glutamate toxicity in the hippocampus",
                "Melatonin production in the pineal gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estradiol acts as a potent modulator of the serotonergic system; its decline reduces serotonin synthesis and receptor binding, which is a primary driver of perimenopausal mood disorders."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A client with previously well-managed ADHD reports that her stimulant medication is no longer effective and her executive dysfunction has peaked. What is the biological explanation?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone increases the clearance rate of ADHD medications",
                "Declining estrogen reduces dopamine receptor sensitivity and availability",
                "Cortisol spikes during hot flashes neutralize dopamine",
                "Age-related cognitive decline is mimicking ADHD symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is essential for dopamine signaling. As estrogen levels drop during perimenopause, dopamine levels and receptor sensitivity also decline, often exacerbating ADHD symptoms and making previously effective medication doses feel insufficient."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to the SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) data, how much more likely are women to experience significant depressive symptoms during the perimenopausal transition compared to premenopause?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SWAN study and other longitudinal research indicate that women are 2 to 4 times more likely to experience a major depressive episode or significant depressive symptoms during the perimenopausal transition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stimulus Control Therapy involves strict rules, such as leaving the bed if not asleep within 20 minutes, to re-establish the bed as a cue for sleep rather than a place for rumination and anxiety."
