            "question": "According to the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis discussed in Lesson 1, initiating Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) at what stage provides the maximum cardiovascular protection?",
            "options": [
                "Only after age 65 to ensure the heart is stable",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "At least 15 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only if the client has existing atherosclerotic plaques"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that HRT has a cardioprotective effect when started within the 'window' of 10 years from menopause onset. Initiating it much later, when atherosclerosis is already established, may increase risks."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During the first 5 to 7 years of menopause, women can lose up to what percentage of their total bone mineral density (BMD)?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "20%",
                "40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 highlights that the rapid decline in estrogen leads to an accelerated phase of bone loss, where women can lose up to 20% of their BMD in the first 5-7 years post-menopause."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Which specific enzyme, produced by the gut estrobolome, is responsible for deconjugating estrogens so they can be reabsorbed into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Lipoprotein lipase",
                "Aromatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the key enzyme in the estrobolome that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the 'active' estrogen to re-enter circulation via the enterohepatic circulation."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), the vaginal pH typically shifts in which direction due to the loss of Lactobacilli?",
            "options": [
                "From acidic (3.8-4.5) to alkaline (>5.0)",
                "From alkaline (>7.0) to acidic (3.0-4.0)",
                "It remains neutral (7.0) regardless of estrogen levels",
                "It becomes highly acidic (<2.0) causing chemical irritation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen loss leads to decreased glycogen, which reduces the population of Lactobacilli. This causes the vaginal pH to rise from an acidic range to a more alkaline range (above 5.0), increasing infection risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Neuroimaging studies discussed in Lesson 5 show that the menopausal 'brain fog' is often linked to a 20-25% reduction in what metabolic process in the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Protein synthesis",
                "Glucose metabolism",
                "Cerebrospinal fluid production",
                "Synaptic pruning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The menopausal transition is associated with a significant drop in cerebral glucose metabolism, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which manifests as cognitive difficulties."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Why is transdermal estradiol (patches/gels) generally considered safer than oral estradiol regarding Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) risk?",
            "options": [
                "It is less potent than oral medication",
                "It bypasses the first-pass hepatic metabolism, avoiding the stimulation of clotting factors",
                "It is absorbed more slowly over 24 hours",
                "It contains synthetic progestins that stabilize the blood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oral estrogen passes through the liver first, where it stimulates the production of coagulation factors. Transdermal delivery avoids this 'first-pass' effect, resulting in a negligible increase in blood clot risk."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in postmenopausal women (Lesson 7), what is the recommended minimum amount of high-quality protein per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams",
                "15-20 grams",
                "30-40 grams (containing ~2.5-3g Leucine)",
                "70-80 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postmenopausal women require a higher 'leucine threshold' (approx. 2.5-3g) to trigger MPS compared to younger women. This typically requires a bolus of 30-40g of protein per meal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which biomarker shift is most characteristic of the metabolic changes seen in the 'Menopausal Transition' (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "Increase in HDL and decrease in LDL",
                "Decrease in visceral fat and increase in subcutaneous fat",
                "Increase in LDL, triglycerides, and visceral adiposity",
                "Decrease in fasting insulin and blood glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The loss of estrogen triggers a shift toward android (visceral) fat distribution and an atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by higher LDL and triglycerides."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 52, is experiencing severe vaginal dryness and recurrent UTIs but has no hot flashes. According to Lesson 4, what is the most appropriate first-line clinical intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Systemic high-dose oral HRT",
                "Low-dose local (vaginal) estrogen therapy",
                "Daily cranberry juice and probiotics only",
                "Broad-spectrum antibiotics for 6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For isolated GSM symptoms (dryness/UTIs) without systemic vasomotor symptoms, low-dose local estrogen is the gold standard as it treats the tissue directly with minimal systemic absorption."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In the context of skeletal integrity, what is the 'Mechanostat' principle mentioned in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "Bone only grows when estrogen levels are at their peak",
                "Bone adapts its structure to the mechanical loads placed upon it",
                "The brain regulates bone density via the pituitary gland",
                "Calcium absorption is only possible during weight-bearing exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mechanostat model describes how bone senses mechanical strain (from resistance training) and signals osteoblasts to form new bone, which is crucial for preventing osteoporosis."
