            "question": "According to the 'Window of Vulnerability' model discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary neurobiological reason for increased depressive symptoms during perimenopause?",
            "options": [
                "The absolute lack of estrogen in the brain",
                "The sensitivity of the brain to the fluctuation and withdrawal of estrogen",

                "The sudden increase in testosterone levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests it is the rate of change and the brain's sensitivity to estrogen withdrawal—rather than the absolute level of estrogen—that triggers mood disorders in vulnerable women."

            "question": "In Lesson 3, we discussed the role of Progesterone in emotional regulation. Which neurotransmitter system does Progesterone primarily influence to provide a 'calming' effect?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone metabolites, specifically allopregnanolone, act as potent positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors, which has a significant anxiolytic and calming effect on the nervous system."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-compassion, particularly the work of Dr. Kristin Neff, has been shown to reduce body dissatisfaction and surveillance by shifting focus from 'objectification' to 'functionality' and kindness."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a flexible and resilient autonomic nervous system with strong vagal tone, meaning the client can recover more quickly from stress."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sandwich Generation' describes midlife individuals who are 'sandwiched' between the needs of aging parents and their own children, leading to unique 'caregiver strain' and high cortisol levels."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Brain Fog' and is worried she has early-onset dementia. According to Lesson 5, how should a coach refit this using evidence-based data?",

                "Agree that it is likely dementia and suggest immediate retirement",
                "Explain that 'Brain Fog' is often a temporary cognitive reorganization during the transition, not a permanent decline",
                "Suggest that brain fog is entirely psychological and has no physiological basis",
                "Advise her to stop all cognitive tasks until the fog clears"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing involves educating the client that menopausal brain fog is often related to fluctuating estrogen affecting the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and for most, it is a transient phase."
