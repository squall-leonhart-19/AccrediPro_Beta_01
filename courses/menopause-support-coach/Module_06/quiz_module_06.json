            "question": "Research indicates that during the menopausal transition, cerebral glucose metabolism can decline by up to 20-25%. Which mechanism primarily drives this 'brain fog'?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in cerebral blood flow due to progesterone spikes",
                "The loss of estrogen's role in promoting glucose transporter (GLUT1) expression and mitochondrial efficiency",
                "An overproduction of cortisol leading to permanent hippocampus shrinkage",
                "A natural age-related decline that is entirely unrelated to hormonal shifts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a key regulator of brain energy metabolism; its decline reduces the brain's ability to utilize glucose effectively, leading to the cognitive 'energy gap' known as brain fog."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis regarding neuroprotection, when is HRT most effective at reducing the long-term risk of Alzheimer's Disease?",
            "options": [
                "Only if started at least 15 years after the final menstrual period",
                "When initiated during the perimenopausal transition or early post-menopause (within 10 years of FMP)",
                "Only in women who have already been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment",
                "HRT has been proven to have no effect on neuroprotection regardless of timing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' suggests that estrogen therapy is neuroprotective when initiated near the onset of menopause, whereas starting it much later may not provide the same cognitive benefits."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'U-bend' refers to the statistical trend where life satisfaction dips in midlife but rises significantly as women move into the post-menopausal stage and find renewed purpose."

                "Excessive intake of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hair thinning in menopause is usually caused by a 'relative androgen dominance'—as estrogen drops, the remaining androgens have a more pronounced effect on hair follicles."

            "options": [
                "It is the only way to build significant muscle mass",
                "It improves mitochondrial flexibility and promotes the clearance of metabolic waste",
                "It raises cortisol to the highest possible levels to stimulate energy",
