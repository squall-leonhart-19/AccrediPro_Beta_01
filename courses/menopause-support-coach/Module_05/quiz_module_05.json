            "question": "According to Lesson 1, how does the decline of 17β-estradiol specifically impact cellular energy production?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the efficiency of the Krebs cycle to compensate for low blood sugar",
                "It impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and reduces the expression of cytochrome c oxidase",
                "It triggers a permanent shift from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis",
                "It stimulates the overproduction of ATP, leading to cellular burnout and oxidative stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a master regulator of mitochondrial function; its decline reduces mitochondrial efficiency and the expression of key enzymes like cytochrome c oxidase, leading to decreased ATP production."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure (lux > 1,000) is the primary zeitgeber that resets the SCN, anchors the circadian rhythm, and promotes a healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Imaging studies show a 20-25% reduction in brain glucose metabolism during perimenopause and menopause, creating a 'hypometabolic' state that manifests as cognitive fatigue and brain fog."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Menopause increases insulin resistance; high-glycemic meals cause rapid spikes and subsequent crashes in blood glucose, which triggers the release of adrenaline and cortisol, leading to fatigue and 'hangry' symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 introduces the 'Burnout Trap' in exercise. Why is excessive high-intensity interval training (HIIT) often counterproductive for a highly stressed perimenopausal woman?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a permanent down-regulation of the thyroid gland",
                "It promotes excessive muscle hypertrophy that the menopausal frame cannot support",
                "It can chronically elevate cortisol and systemic inflammation, leading to 'tired but wired' symptoms",
                "It reduces the body's ability to utilize oxygen during rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While HIIT is beneficial in moderation, excessive high-intensity work in the presence of existing HPA axis dysregulation can lead to chronic cortisol elevation, which promotes visceral fat storage and systemic fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the biochemical pathway prioritizes the production of cortisol (the survival hormone) over the production of sex hormones like progesterone, which share the same precursor, pregnenolone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium Glycinate is highly bioavailable and the glycine component acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, making it the preferred form for sleep and nervous system support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "3:00 AM wakings are often 'cortisol spikes' triggered by a drop in blood glucose. The body releases cortisol and adrenaline to mobilize glucose, which inadvertently wakes the brain into a state of hyperarousal."
