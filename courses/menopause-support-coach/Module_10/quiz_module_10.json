            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which metabolic marker is considered the 'gold standard' for detecting early-stage insulin resistance in menopausal women when fasting blood glucose still appears within the normal range?",
            "options": ["HbA1c", "HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)", "Fasting Triglycerides", "LDL-C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR calculates the relationship between fasting insulin and fasting glucose, revealing if the body is overproducing insulin to maintain stable glucose levels, which often precedes HbA1c elevation in menopause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "High levels of the enzyme Beta-glucuronidase in the estrobolome lead to which physiological outcome?",
            "options": ["Increased excretion of estrogen in the stool", "Rapid degradation of progesterone", "Deconjugation and reabsorption of estrogen into the bloodstream", "Enhanced synthesis of Vitamin K2"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-glues' conjugated estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation rather than excreted, potentially contributing to estrogen dominance symptoms even during the transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis discussed in Lesson 3, when is HRT most effective at providing cardioprotective benefits?",
            "options": ["Only after age 65", "Within 10 years of the final menstrual period (FMP)", "At least 15 years after the onset of menopause", "During the pre-menopause phase only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that initiating Hormone Replacement Therapy within 10 years of menopause (or before age 60) supports endothelial function and reduces cardiovascular risk, whereas late initiation may have neutral or negative effects."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "To combat 'Anabolic Resistance' in post-menopausal women, what is the recommended per-meal protein threshold to effectively trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": ["10-15 grams", "15-20 grams", "30-40 grams, with ~3g of Leucine", "Over 60 grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to decreased hormonal signaling, menopausal women require a higher 'bolus' of protein (30-40g) and specific amino acids like Leucine to overcome the higher threshold for muscle tissue repair and growth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "The menopausal brain undergoes a 'bioenergetic shift.' When glucose metabolism declines due to low estrogen, what is the primary cellular mechanism contributing to 'brain fog' and neuro-inflammation?",
            "options": ["Excessive serotonin production", "Activation of microglial cells and mitochondrial inefficiency", "Increased blood flow to the prefrontal cortex", "Downregulation of the HPA axis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is neuroprotective; its decline can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and the activation of microglia (the brain's immune cells), which triggers inflammatory cytokines and cognitive symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "When using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a precision tracking tool, a significant, sustained drop in a client's 'baseline' HRV most likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Improved cardiovascular fitness", "Increased parasympathetic dominance", "Systemic stress, poor recovery, or rising inflammation", "Successful adaptation to a new supplement"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A lower HRV indicates that the sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) is dominant, signaling that the client is not recovering well from stressors, whether physical, emotional, or metabolic."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In the 'Integrated Care Team' model, which action is strictly within the scope of practice for a Menopause Support Coach?",
            "options": ["Ordering and interpreting diagnostic blood panels independently", "Adjusting a client's prescribed dose of estradiol", "Providing nutritional and lifestyle strategies to support medical interventions", "Diagnosing clinical depression"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches support the client's lifestyle and 'bridge the gap' between the doctor's office and daily life; they do not diagnose, prescribe, or alter medical treatments."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "During the THRIVE Maintenance Phase, what is the primary purpose of 'Reverse Dieting'?",
            "options": ["To rapidly lose the last 5 pounds", "To gradually increase caloric intake to restore metabolic rate without significant fat gain", "To eliminate all carbohydrates from the diet", "To transition the client back to a sedentary lifestyle"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse dieting involves slowly increasing calories back to maintenance levels to 'heal' the metabolism after a deficit, ensuring the client can maintain their weight loss on more food."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of musculoskeletal longevity found that women lose approximately what percentage of their muscle mass per year following menopause if no intervention is taken?",
            "options": ["0.1%", "0.5%", "1-2%", "5-7%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal women can lose 1-2% of muscle mass and up to 3% of muscle strength annually, making resistance training and protein intake critical for longevity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which 'Precision Tracking' metric is most useful for identifying how specific dietary fibers affect a client's post-prandial glucose stability?",
            "options": ["Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)", "Basal Body Temperature", "Waist-to-Hip Ratio", "DEXA Scan"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A CGM provides real-time data on how blood sugar responds to specific foods, allowing for the 'precision' tailoring of carbohydrate and fiber intake for metabolic health."
