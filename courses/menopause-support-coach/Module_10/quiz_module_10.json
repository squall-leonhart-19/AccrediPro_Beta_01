            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that between 50% and 70% of postmenopausal women experience symptoms of GSM, though many do not report them to their healthcare providers due to embarrassment or the assumption that it is a 'normal' part of aging."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Control Model, developed by Bancroft and Janssen, posits that sexual response involves the interaction between excitatory signals (accelerators) and inhibitory signals (brakes).

            "explanation": "In menopause, pain often leads to 'guarding,' resulting in hypertonic (tight) pelvic floor muscles. PFPT focuses on down-training these muscles, improving blood flow, and increasing tissue elasticity to reduce pain."
