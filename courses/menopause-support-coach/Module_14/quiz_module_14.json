            "question": "In the context of Advanced Metabolic Flexibility (Lesson 1), what does a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70 typically indicate about a client's substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "The client is primarily burning carbohydrates for fuel.",
                "The client is in a state of pure protein catabolism.",
                "The client is primarily utilizing fatty acids for fuel.",
                "The client has achieved perfect metabolic balance between glucose and fats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that 100% of the energy is being derived from fat oxidation, whereas an RER of 1.0 indicates 100% carbohydrate oxidation."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on the Estrobolome, how does an overabundance of beta-glucuronidase-producing bacteria impact estrogen levels?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the excretion of estrogen through feces.",
                "It deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream.",
                "It permanently deactivates estrogen receptors in the gut lining.",
                "It converts progesterone into harmful estrogen metabolites."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of beta-glucuronidase deconjugate estrogen (break the bond with glucuronic acid), allowing the 'active' estrogen to be reabsorbed into circulation via the enterohepatic pathway."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, neuro-inflammation in the menopausal brain is largely attributed to the shift of microglia into which state?",
            "options": [
                "The M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype",
                "The M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype",
                "The quiescent or 'resting' state",
                "The neuro-regenerative state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loss of estrogen causes microglia to shift from a surveillance mode to a 'primed' or M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, increasing the production of cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses Cardiovascular Resilience. What is the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis regarding Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)?",
            "options": [
                "HRT is most effective for bone health if started after age 70.",
                "HRT must be stopped within 2 years of the final menstrual period to avoid stroke.",
                "HRT provides cardioprotective benefits primarily when started within 10 years of menopause onset.",
                "HRT only benefits the cardiovascular system if the client has existing atherosclerosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' suggests that HRT is cardioprotective when initiated close to the onset of menopause (usually within 10 years or before age 60) before significant arterial plaque has formed."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 5 (Osteo-Immunology), how does the decline of estrogen lead to increased bone resorption?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases the production of RANKL by T-cells.",
                "It increases the production of Osteoprotegerin (OPG), which kills osteoblasts.",
                "It leads to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines that upregulate RANKL, stimulating osteoclast activity.",
                "It causes calcium to be trapped inside the bone matrix, making it brittle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen deficiency increases the production of cytokines (like TNF and IL-17) that upregulate RANKL. RANKL binds to receptors on osteoclast precursors, leading to increased bone breakdown."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "In Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (Lesson 6), what is the typical shift observed in vaginal pH?",
            "options": [
                "pH shifts from acidic (3.8–4.5) to more alkaline (>5.0).",
                "pH shifts from alkaline (>7.0) to highly acidic (<3.0).",
                "pH remains stable, but the volume of Lactobacillus increases.",
                "pH shifts from 5.5 to 4.0, increasing the risk of yeast infections."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Loss of estrogen leads to decreased glycogen and fewer Lactobacillus, causing the vaginal pH to rise from an acidic range (3.8–4.5) to a more neutral or alkaline range (>5.0)."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 explains that hot flashes are a result of a 'narrowed thermotherapeutic zone.' Which neurotransmitter shift is primarily responsible for this narrowing?",
            "options": [
                "Increased GABA and decreased Glutamate",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The narrowing of the thermotherapeutic zone in the hypothalamus is driven by increased central norepinephrine and changes in serotonin receptors (5-HT2A)."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Under the 'Longevity Blueprint' (Lesson 8), the THRIVE framework emphasizes 'H' for Hormetic Stress. Which of the following is an example of a hormetic stressor discussed?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormetic stressors are brief, controlled stresses (like HIIT, sauna, or cold exposure) that trigger cellular repair mechanisms like autophagy and antioxidant production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This client shows signs of metabolic inflexibility and potential neuro-inflammation. Timed feeding helps restore insulin sensitivity, while anti-inflammatory nutrients support brain health."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "According to the statistics provided in Lesson 4, what percentage of women develop at least one 'traditional' cardiovascular risk factor (like hypertension or high cholesterol) during the menopausal transition?",
