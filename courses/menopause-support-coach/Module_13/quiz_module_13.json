            "options": [
                "The coach's natural urge to correct a client's behavior or provide immediate solutions",
                "The client's ability to self-correct their hormonal imbalances through lifestyle",
                "A physiological response to vasomotor symptoms that causes sudden posture changes",
                "The process of aligning a client's values with their health goals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Righting Reflex' is a core MI concept where the coach feels the urge to fix the client's problems, which often inadvertently triggers resistance and defensiveness in the client."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "When a client in perimenopause displays 'resistance' to a new strength training protocol, how does the Advanced Coaching methodology suggest viewing this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "As a lack of motivation that requires stricter accountability measures",
                "As feedback indicating a perceived threat to the client's autonomy or current identity",
                "As a symptom of declining estrogen affecting cognitive flexibility",
                "As a sign that the client is not yet in the 'Contemplation' stage of change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced coaching views resistance not as a personality trait, but as feedback that the current approach may be threatening the client's autonomy or identity, requiring a shift in coaching style."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Storming phase, conflict often arises as members test boundaries. The coach must actively facilitate resolution and reinforce the 'psychological safety' rules established at the start."

            "question": "When analyzing symptom data using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), a reduction of how many points is typically required to be considered a 'clinically meaningful' improvement in quality of life?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a 5-point shift on the total MRS score (which ranges from 0 to 44) represents a clinically significant change in the client's perceived quality of life."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests roughly 60% of women have at least one ACE. In midlife, hormonal shifts can resurface past traumas, making trauma-informed 'safety and choice' protocols essential."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced coaching uses data to drive collaborative behavior change. Since the correlation is high, modifying the specific trigger (blue light) is the most direct and evidence-based coaching intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dialectical thinking helps clients move away from binary (success/failure) mindsets, allowing them to hold two seemingly opposite truths—such as 'I missed my workout' and 'I am still committed to my health.'"

                "Only 20% of symptoms are actually related to hormones",
                "A 20% reduction in symptom frequency often leads to a disproportionate 50% increase in self-efficacy",
                "Coaches should spend only 20% of the session talking",
                "Clients usually forget 20% of their symptoms unless tracked in real-time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '20% Rule' in advanced tracking suggests that even modest, measurable reductions in symptoms (around 20%) can trigger a significant psychological boost in a client's belief in their ability to manage their transition."
