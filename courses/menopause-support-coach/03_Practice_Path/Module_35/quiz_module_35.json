            "question": "When transitioning from a 1:1 model to group coaching, what is the primary metric used to determine the 'Leverage Ratio' of the new model?",
            "options": [
                "The total number of hours worked per week divided by the number of clients.",
                "The revenue generated per hour of delivery compared to the 1:1 hourly rate.",
                "The percentage of clients who successfully complete the program.",
                "The ratio of marketing spend to the number of group participants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Leverage Ratio in scaling refers to the increase in revenue generated for every hour of the coach's time. Transitioning to groups allows a coach to serve 10-20 clients in the same hour previously dedicated to one, significantly increasing the hourly delivery value."

            "question": "In the context of High-Ticket Masterminds (L2), what is the 'Transformation-to-Information' ratio necessary to justify premium pricing ($5k - $15k)?",
            "options": [
                "10% Transformation / 90% Information",

                "100% Information provided via digital downloads"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket clients pay for outcomes and implementation (transformation), not just facts. Premium masterminds should focus heavily on high-level support, community, and specific physiological breakthroughs rather than just delivering content."

            "question": "A Menopause Coach builds a 'Value Ladder' starting with a free hormone guide, a $47 mini-course, and a $2,000 coaching program. What is the primary purpose of the $47 'Tripwire' product?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Tripwire or 'Liquidator' product is designed to convert a lead into a customer quickly. This psychological shift is crucial, and the revenue often offsets the cost of the ads used to find the lead (CAC)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To operate within an integrated care model, coaches must have a signed HIPAA Release of Information from the client and, if handling protected health information (PHI) on behalf of a covered entity, a BAA."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Ceiling of Complexity' occurs when the founder's personal involvement in every task prevents further growth. Scaling beyond this requires moving from 'doing' to 'leading' by implementing SOPs and hiring support staff."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Corporate (B2B) clients are motivated by ROI. Highlighting how menopause support reduces 'presenteeism' (being at work but unproductive) and retains experienced female leaders is the most compelling business case."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LTV:CAC is calculated as $1,200 / $200 = 6. A 6:1 ratio is considered excellent in the coaching industry, indicating that for every $1 spent on marketing, the business earns $6 in lifetime revenue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most multi-coach practices use a percentage split (often 40-60%) to cover the practice's marketing costs, administrative overhead, and profit margin while compensating the associate coach for their delivery time."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Professional services and coaching businesses that can run without the founder are typically valued at a multiple (e.g., 2x to 5x) of their annual EBITDA (net profit)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
