            "options": [
                "A period of immediate excitement and new beginnings",
                "A psychological 'no-man's land' where the old identity is gone but the new one isn't yet formed",

                "The final stage of acceptance and integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Zone is the second stage of transition, characterized by uncertainty and confusion, but it is also the 'fertile void' where significant psychological growth and creativity occur."

                "Viewing the cessation of the menstrual cycle as the loss of femininity",
                "Reframing the 'empty nest' as 'spacious renewal' and an opportunity for self-actualization",
                "Accepting that cognitive decline is an inevitable part of the transition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Liberation mindset focuses on the 'Postmenopausal Zest,' reframing traditional losses (like the empty nest) as opportunities for personal growth and redirected energy."

            "question": "Lesson 3 highlights that post-menopause, the HPA-axis becomes more sensitive to stress. What is a primary physiological reason for this change?",
            "options": [
                "The loss of the neuroprotective and stress-buffering effects of estrogen and progesterone",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen and progesterone act as natural buffers to the stress response; their decline leaves the HPA-axis more reactive to cortisol, making stress management a physiological necessity."
