            "question": "Research indicates that after the age of 50, women who do not engage in resistance training lose muscle mass (sarcopenia) at an average rate of:",
            "options": [
                "1-2% per decade",
                "3-8% per decade",
                "10-15% per decade",
                "20% per decade"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that sedentary adults lose 3-8% of their muscle mass per decade after age 30, with the rate accelerating significantly after age 50 and the onset of menopause."

            "question": "When balancing Zone 2 and HIIT for a perimenopausal client with high cortisol levels, what is the recommended 'Polarized Training' distribution to prevent burnout?",
            "options": [
                "50% Zone 2 / 50% HIIT",
                "20% Zone 2 / 80% HIIT",
                "80% Zone 2 / 20% HIIT",
                "100% HIIT to maximize calorie burn"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An 80/20 split (80% low-intensity Zone 2 and 20% high-intensity) allows for metabolic benefits and mitochondrial health without chronically elevating cortisol, which is crucial during the hormonal fluctuations of perimenopause."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "To manage intra-abdominal pressure and protect the pelvic floor during a heavy lift (e.g., a deadlift), which breathing technique should a coach instruct?",
            "options": [
                "Holding the breath (Valsalva Maneuver) throughout the entire lift",
                "Inhaling deeply during the concentric (effort) phase",
                "Exhaling on the exertion (concentric phase) to lift the pelvic floor",
                "Rapid shallow breathing to maintain oxygenation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'exhale on exertion' strategy helps manage intra-abdominal pressure, reducing the downward force on the pelvic floor and minimizing the risk of stress urinary incontinence (SUI)."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Declining estrogen levels during menopause contribute to 'menopausal arthralgia' (joint pain) primarily by affecting which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the thickness of joint cartilage",
                "Reducing collagen synthesis and decreasing the hydration of connective tissues",
                "Decreasing the production of lactic acid",
                "Increasing the rate of bone remodeling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a key role in collagen production and tissue hydration; its decline leads to stiffer tendons, ligaments, and reduced joint lubrication, resulting in pain and stiffness."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Why is the 'Anabolic Window' for protein ingestion more critical for post-menopausal women compared to younger women?",
            "options": [
                "They digest protein faster than younger women",
                "They have higher levels of growth hormone",
                "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' caused by the loss of estrogen's signaling effects",
                "Because they require fewer calories overall"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal women face 'anabolic resistance,' meaning they require a more precise timing and a higher bolus of protein (30-40g) post-exercise to trigger muscle protein synthesis effectively."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "For a post-menopausal client, which training stimulus is most effective for improving Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and preventing osteoporosis?",
            "options": [
                "High-repetition, low-weight 'toning' exercises (20+ reps)",
                "Steady-state walking for 60 minutes daily",
                "High-intensity resistance training (80-85% 1RM) with multi-joint movements",
                "Daily static stretching and restorative yoga"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mechanical loading through heavy resistance training (low reps, high weight) and impact is required to stimulate osteoblast activity and maintain bone density in the absence of estrogen."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "A client is hesitant to start strength training because she fears 'bulking up.' Which response is most evidence-based for a menopause coach?",
            "options": [
                "Tell her she will only bulk up if she eats 5,000 calories a day",
                "Explain that low testosterone and declining estrogen make significant hypertrophy difficult, and muscle is more metabolically active than fat",
                "Suggest she stick to 2lb dumbbells to be safe",
                "Advise her to do only cardio until she loses 10lbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiologically, the hormonal environment of menopause (low estrogen/low testosterone) makes significant 'bulking' nearly impossible; however, building muscle is vital for metabolic rate and insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a specific sign of 'Under-recovery' or Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) in a mature female athlete?",
            "options": [
                "A 5% increase in strength over one month",
                "Increased sleep quality and deeper REM cycles",
                "A persistent increase in resting heart rate (RHR) and loss of the 'morning' appetite",
                "Occasional muscle soreness 24 hours after a new workout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A rise in resting heart rate, coupled with suppressed appetite and disrupted sleep, are classic autonomic nervous system indicators that the body is not recovering from the current training load."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Jane (54, post-menopausal) has a history of mild pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Which exercise modification is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Avoid all forms of resistance training forever",
                "Perform seated or lying exercises (e.g., seated press instead of standing) to reduce vertical pressure",
                "Only perform high-impact jumping jacks to 'strengthen' the floor",
                "Use the Valsalva maneuver on every rep to stabilize the core"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modifying the gravity-loaded position (seated or supine) allows a client with POP to continue strength training while minimizing the direct downward pressure on the pelvic floor."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "According to the LIFTMOR study (2018), high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) in post-menopausal women resulted in:",
            "options": [
                "No change in bone density but increased fat mass",
                "Significant increases in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck with zero injuries",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The landmark LIFTMOR trial demonstrated that supervised, high-intensity loading is not only safe for post-menopausal women with low bone mass but is highly effective at increasing BMD and functional performance."
