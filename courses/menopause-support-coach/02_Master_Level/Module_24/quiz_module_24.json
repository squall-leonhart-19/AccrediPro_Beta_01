            "question": "In Advanced Clinical Reasoning, what is the primary purpose of 'Symptom Mapping' beyond simple identification?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a medical diagnosis for the client's GP",
                "To identify clusters that reveal underlying physiological drivers like HPA-axis dysfunction or systemic inflammation",
                "To determine which specific HRT dosage the client requires",
                "To replace the need for blood pathology testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Symptom mapping at a Master Practitioner level focuses on identifying patterns and clusters that point toward root physiological imbalances, such as the intersection of cortisol dysregulation and estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "The 'Neuro-Endocrine Integration' lesson highlights that estrogen acts as a master regulator of brain metabolism. Which process is most affected by the decline of estradiol in the hypothalamus?",
            "options": [
                "The upregulation of serotonin receptors",
                "Glucose uptake and ATP production, leading to a 'bioenergetic crisis'",
                "The immediate cessation of the HPA response",
                "Increased myelination of the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol is crucial for brain glucose metabolism. Its decline can lead to a 20-25% drop in brain energy levels, often referred to as a bioenergetic crisis, which triggers symptoms like brain fog and hot flashes."

        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 2.8. According to the Metabolic Flexibility mastery lesson, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "The client is metabolically healthy and flexible",
                "The client is in a state of clinical Type 1 Diabetes",
                "The client demonstrates early-stage insulin resistance and impaired metabolic flexibility",
                "The client's insulin levels are too low to process glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score above 1.9 suggests early insulin resistance; a score over 2.9 indicates significant resistance. 2.8 represents a state where metabolic flexibility is likely compromised."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Regarding Epigenetics, the COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) gene polymorphism is particularly relevant in menopause because it affects:",
            "options": [
                "The conversion of testosterone to estrogen",
                "The methylation and clearance of estrogen metabolites and catecholamines",
                "The absorption of Vitamin D in the gut",
                "The production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme is responsible for the methylation of estrogen. Poor COMT function (the 'slow' variant) can lead to an accumulation of 4-OH estrogens, which are potentially DNA-damaging, and increased stress sensitivity."

        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), the concept of 'Allostatic Load' refers to:",

                "The total amount of weight a menopausal woman can lift during resistance training",
                "The wear and tear on the body caused by chronic overactivation of the stress response systems",
                "The psychological burden of changing social roles",
                "The specific inflammatory markers found in the synovial fluid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is the cumulative physiological toll on the body resulting from chronic stress, which in menopause can exacerbate systemic inflammation and hormonal imbalances."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "When managing a client with Multi-Morbidity (e.g., Osteoporosis and Type 2 Diabetes), what is the 'Master Practitioner' priority?",
            "options": [
                "Treating each condition as a separate silo with independent protocols",
                "Identifying the 'Common Soil'—shared mechanisms like chronic inflammation and insulin resistance that drive both conditions",
                "Focusing exclusively on the condition with the most severe symptoms",
                "Withdrawing all supplements to avoid any potential interactions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced practitioners look for 'Common Soil'—the underlying physiological mechanisms (like oxidative stress or insulin resistance) that contribute to multiple seemingly unrelated health issues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Third Act' involves a psychological transition where the individual moves beyond roles defined by others toward an identity rooted in personal values, wisdom, and self-actualization."

            "id": "q24_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting or prescribing medication doses (including HRT) is strictly a medical act. Coaches provide education and lifestyle support but must never alter a client's prescribed medical protocol."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3 found that what percentage of post-menopausal women meet the criteria for Metabolic Syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Between 30-50%, representing a significant increase from pre-menopausal levels",
                "Less than 5% if they exercise regularly",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases significantly during the menopause transition, with many studies placing the post-menopausal rate between 30% and 50%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners recognize 'liminality' as a necessary phase of the identity transition in menopause, allowing the client to process grief before rushing into 'solution mode.'"
