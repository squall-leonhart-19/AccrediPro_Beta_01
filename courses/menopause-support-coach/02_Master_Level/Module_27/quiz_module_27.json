            "question": "According to a 2023 Mayo Clinic study, what is the estimated annual cost of lost productivity due to menopause symptoms in the United States alone?",
            "options": [
                "$500 million",
                "$1.8 billion",
                "$150 million",
                "$10.2 billion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2023) estimated that menopause symptoms cost US employers $1.8 billion in lost work time annually, highlighting the critical need for corporate menopause support."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Women diagnosed with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) before age 40 face significantly higher risks than those with natural menopause. What is the standard clinical recommendation for HRT duration in POI cases?",
            "options": [
                "HRT should be avoided due to long-term breast cancer risks.",
                "HRT should be used for a maximum of 5 years.",
                "HRT should be maintained at least until the average age of natural menopause (approx. 51).",
                "HRT is only necessary until symptoms like hot flashes subside."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines (EMAS and NAMS) recommend that women with POI take HRT until at least age 51 to protect bone density and cardiovascular health, as they are at much higher risk for early-onset osteoporosis and heart disease."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy) differs from natural menopause in which specific hormonal aspect?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a gradual decline in estrogen over 10 years.",
                "It results in an immediate 50% drop in circulating testosterone levels.",
                "It preserves the protective effects of progesterone.",
                "It prevents the rise of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike natural menopause where the ovaries continue to produce small amounts of androgens, surgical removal of the ovaries causes an abrupt and permanent 50% decrease in testosterone, often leading to more severe libido and energy issues."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "For a neurodivergent client with ADHD, why does the perimenopausal decline in estrogen often lead to a 'crash' in executive function?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen competes with ADHD medication for absorption.",
                "Estrogen acts as a key modulator for dopamine; lower estrogen reduces dopamine signaling efficiency.",
                "Estrogen increases the sensitivity to sensory overload.",
                "Progesterone is the only hormone that affects ADHD symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a neurosteroid that promotes the synthesis and reduces the degradation of dopamine. In ADHD, where dopamine regulation is already challenged, the drop in estrogen significantly exacerbates executive dysfunction and 'brain fog'."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "The SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) found that which demographic group experiences the longest average duration of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (10.1 years)?",
            "options": [
                "Caucasian women",
                "Japanese women",
                "African American women",
                "Hispanic women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SWAN study demonstrated significant racial disparities, showing that African American women experience hot flashes for a median of 10.1 years, nearly double the duration of Caucasian and Asian women, often due to the cumulative impact of 'weathering' and systemic stressors."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "To counteract 'Anabolic Resistance' in high-performance menopausal athletes, what is the recommended daily protein intake range?",
            "options": [
                "0.8g per kg of body weight",
                "1.0 - 1.2g per kg of body weight",
                "1.5 - 2.2g per kg of body weight",
                "Exactly 3.0g per kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the loss of estrogen's anabolic effects on muscle protein synthesis, menopausal athletes require higher protein intakes (1.5-2.2g/kg) and specifically timed leucine-rich doses to maintain lean mass and performance."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "In clients with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) or Histamine Intolerance, why is the perimenopausal period particularly difficult?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen stimulates mast cell degranulation and inhibits the DAO enzyme.",
                "Progesterone increases histamine production in the gut.",
                "Testosterone causes mast cells to become dormant.",
                "Hormones have no interaction with the immune system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen can trigger mast cells to release histamine and simultaneously downregulates the DAO enzyme which clears histamine. This often leads to a 'histamine-estrogen' loop that worsens allergy-like symptoms during hormonal peaks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "A client's nutrigenomic report shows a 'Slow COMT' (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) variant. As a coach, you should understand this may impact their:",
            "options": [
                "Ability to digest carbohydrates.",
                "Clearance of estrogen metabolites and stress catecholamines.",
                "Vitamin D receptor sensitivity.",
                "Calcium absorption in the small intestine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme is responsible for the methylation (detoxification) of catechol estrogens and neurotransmitters like dopamine. A 'slow' variant suggests the client may need extra support (like magnesium or cruciferous vegetables) to clear these compounds effectively."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Sarah, a 45-year-old executive, reports that her 'sensory processing' has changed; she finds the office lights too bright and the noise unbearable. Which specialty application does this most likely relate to?",
            "options": [
                "High-performance athletics",
                "Surgical menopause",
                "Neurodivergent menopause (unmasking)",
                "Nutrigenomics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormonal shifts often lead to 'unmasking' in neurodivergent women or those with sensory processing sensitivities, where the loss of estrogen reduces the brain's ability to filter sensory input, leading to increased overwhelm."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "When designing a 'Personalized THRIVE Protocol' for a client with multiple comorbidities, what is the primary focus of the 'Integrative' (I) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Removing all supplements and starting over.",
                "Focusing only on weight loss as the primary metric.",
                "Collaborating with the client's medical team to ensure lifestyle shifts align with clinical treatments.",
                "Ignoring medical history to focus on 'natural' healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Integrative' phase of the THRIVE protocol emphasizes the necessity of the coach working alongside medical professionals to ensure that nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle interventions safely complement medications and clinical management."
