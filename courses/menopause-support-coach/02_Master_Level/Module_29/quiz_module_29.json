            "question": "In the Non-Linear THRIVE Method™, why is 'Iterative Assessment' considered superior to linear coaching models for menopausal clients?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to skip the intake phase if the client is in a hurry.",
                "It accounts for the fluctuating hormonal landscape where symptoms may regress or shift unpredictably.",
                "It focuses exclusively on the physical symptoms without considering psychological impact.",
                "It mandates a fixed 12-week schedule regardless of client progress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE Method™ recognizes that menopause is not a linear journey; hormonal fluctuations require a recursive approach where assessments are revisited as the physiological landscape changes."

            "question": "When managing Advanced Case Formulation for a client with multimorbidity (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes and Menopause), what is the 'Lead Domino' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Treating every symptom simultaneously with equal intensity.",
                "Focusing on the symptom the client complains about the most, regardless of its cause.",
                "Identifying the primary physiological driver that, when addressed, creates a positive cascade across other conditions.",
                "Referring the client back to a GP and pausing all coaching until the diabetes is resolved."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Lead Domino' strategy involves identifying the root physiological driver (such as insulin resistance or HPA-axis dysfunction) that will yield the greatest systemic improvement across multiple comorbidities."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A coach's role is to act as a bridge, providing the education and data-tracking tools that empower the client to have more productive, informed conversations with their prescribing physician."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Biofeedback Integration, a consistent decline in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) during the menopause transition is most statistically correlated with:",
            "options": [
                "An increase in parasympathetic dominance.",
                "A reduction in systemic inflammation.",

                "Improved metabolic flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that declining estrogen levels are often associated with reduced HRV, reflecting a shift toward sympathetic dominance and a decrease in the body's ability to manage stress (vagal tone)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PNI focuses on the interaction between psychological processes, the nervous system (HPA axis), and the immune system, showing how stress increases pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 during menopause."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "When a client exhibits 'Sustain Talk' in a coaching session, the Master Coach should avoid the 'Righting Reflex.' What does this mean?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should immediately correct the client's incorrect medical assumptions.",
                "The coach should resist the urge to argue for change, as this often increases client resistance.",
                "The coach should ignore the client's concerns and move to the next topic.",
                "The coach should end the session until the client is more motivated."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Righting Reflex' is the natural urge to fix a client's problems; in MI (Motivational Interviewing), resisting this reflex helps the client explore their own internal motivations for change."

            "options": [
                "To make the coaching process look more expensive to potential clients.",
                "To provide a codified, repeatable system that ensures consistent client outcomes and establishes authority.",
                "To replace the need for scientific research in the coaching practice.",
                "To ensure that all clients receive the exact same meal plan."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Signature Framework codifies your unique expertise into a repeatable system, allowing for predictable results and distinguishing your practice in the professional marketplace."

            "question": "In the Capstone Precision Protocol design, which of the following is the correct hierarchy of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Supplements > Exercise > Stress Management > Biological Stabilization.",
                "Biological Stabilization > Lifestyle Optimization > Targeted Supplementation > Refinement.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Precision Protocol follows a logical hierarchy: first stabilizing the biological foundation (sleep, circadian rhythms), then optimizing lifestyle, then adding targeted support, and finally refining the plan based on data."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that 'Compassionate Coaching' techniques resulted in what percentage improvement in client adherence to lifestyle interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%.",
                "Between 40% and 60%.",
                "Exactly 100%.",
                "Less than 5%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data-driven coaching strategies that incorporate behavioral psychology and compassion show significantly higher adherence rates (40-60%) compared to traditional directive coaching."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (52) presents with brain fog, high cortisol, and insulin resistance. Using the PNI-integrated approach, what would be the most effective first step?",
            "options": [
                "A high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program to burn fat.",
                "A strict ketogenic diet to reverse insulin resistance immediately.",
                "Nervous system regulation (e.g., breathwork/vagal toning) to lower the cortisol floor before introducing metabolic stressors.",
                "A complex 15-supplement stack to address all symptoms at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a PNI-based approach, you must lower the 'cortisol floor' first. Adding intense exercise or restrictive diets to an already stressed system can worsen HPA-axis dysfunction and insulin resistance."
