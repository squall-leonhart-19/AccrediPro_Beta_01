            "question": "When utilizing Advanced Pattern Recognition (L1), a coach identifies 'symptom stacking' where a client experiences migraines, night sweats, and irritability simultaneously. This specific clustering is most indicative of which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Luteal Gap' characterized by a precipitous drop in progesterone relative to estrogen",
                "Androgen dominance resulting from PCOS-related insulin resistance",
                "The 'Estrogen Surge' common in early perimenopause",
                "Chronic Glymphatic congestion caused by over-hydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Symptom stacking in the late luteal phase or during irregular cycles often points to the 'Luteal Gap,' where progesterone fails to buffer the systemic effects of estrogen withdrawal, leading to neurovascular and mood symptoms."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "The 'Neuroendocrine Intersection' (L2) describes how chronic HPA axis activation impacts hormone harmony. What is the primary mechanism by which high cortisol exacerbates progesterone deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol increases the rate of estrogen excretion in the kidneys",
                "High cortisol levels compete for and block progesterone receptors (PR-A and PR-B)",
                "Cortisol stimulates the ovaries to produce more testosterone",
                "Stress-induced cortisol production shuts down the thyroid gland entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol has a molecular structure similar to progesterone and can compete for progesterone receptor sites, effectively neutralizing the calming effects of available progesterone even if serum levels are normal."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, a 2023 meta-analysis suggests that 'Metabolic Resistance' in menopause is often driven by Adaptive Thermogenesis. What is the recommended strategy to overcome a 1,200-calorie plateau?",
            "options": [
                "Further reduce caloric intake to 800 calories for 14 days",
                "Increase steady-state cardio to 90 minutes daily",
                "Implement a 'Reverse Diet' by increasing calories by 50-100 per week while prioritizing resistance training",
                "Eliminate all carbohydrates to induce permanent ketosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To combat adaptive thermogenesis and metabolic slowing, coaches should implement a reverse diet to restore the metabolic rate and use resistance training to increase lean muscle mass, which is metabolically active."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4's deep dive into Inflammaging, which biomarker is highlighted as the 'Gold Standard' for tracking chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in menopausal clients?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is the most sensitive marker for the low-grade systemic inflammation (Inflammaging) that characterizes the menopausal transition and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease."

            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses the Glymphatic System. Research indicates that during Deep Sleep (N3), the interstitial space in the brain increases by what percentage to allow for the clearance of metabolic waste like beta-amyloid?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is 60% more active during sleep than during wakefulness, highlighting why sleep deprivation is a primary driver of 'menopausal brain fog' and long-term cognitive decline."

            "question": "In the context of Psychological Flexibility (L6), what is the goal of 'Cognitive Defusion' techniques for a client struggling with their changing body identity?",
            "options": [
                "To prove that the client's negative thoughts are factually incorrect",
                "To help the client see thoughts as 'just words' rather than absolute truths or threats",
                "To suppress all negative thoughts through positive affirmations",
                "To distract the client from their physical symptoms using intensive exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Defusion involves creating distance between the person and their thoughts, allowing them to observe 'I am having the thought that my body is failing' rather than believing 'My body is failing' as an objective truth."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (51) presents with increased anxiety, night sweats, and a sudden 10lb weight gain. She asks you to interpret her blood work and tell her if she needs HRT. According to L8 (Professional Scope), what is the correct response?",
            "options": [
                "Interpret the labs and recommend a specific dose of bioidentical progesterone",
                "Tell her HRT is dangerous and she should only use herbal supplements",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches use labs for education and pattern recognition but must never diagnose or prescribe. Referring to a specialist for medical management is a critical boundary of professional scope."

            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Sarcopenic Obesity' trap. Why is high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sometimes counterproductive for a postmenopausal woman with high Inflammaging markers?",
            "options": [
                "It burns too many calories",
                "It can excessively spike cortisol and IL-6, further driving systemic inflammation if recovery is inadequate",
                "It decreases bone mineral density",
                "It is impossible for women over 50 to perform HIIT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While HIIT can be beneficial, if a client is already in a high-inflammatory/high-stress state, the added cortisol and cytokine spike from intense exercise can exacerbate inflammaging and lead to further muscle wasting."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal bleeding is a red-flag symptom that must be investigated by a physician to rule out endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy; it is strictly outside the coaching scope of practice."
