            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "During the menopausal transition, the decline in 17β-estradiol significantly impacts vascular health primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of Nitric Oxide (NO) leading to chronic hypotension",
                "Reduction in Nitric Oxide bioavailability and impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation",
                "Rapid decrease in blood viscosity and platelet aggregation",
                "Direct calcification of the pulmonary artery within the first 12 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen promotes the production of Nitric Oxide, a potent vasodilator. As estrogen levels drop, endothelial function declines, increasing the risk for hypertension and atherosclerosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2 indicates that the menopausal transition is associated with which specific lipid profile shift?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in total cholesterol but an increase in VLDL",
                "An increase in HDL-C (the 'good' cholesterol) to compensate for LDL",
                "Significant increases in LDL-C, triglycerides, and ApoB, often independent of age",
                "A stabilized lipid profile provided the client maintains a BMI under 25"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The loss of estrogen leads to a more atherogenic lipid profile, characterized by higher LDL, higher triglycerides, and higher Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), which increases cardiovascular risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the pathophysiology of bone loss, what percentage of total lifetime bone mass can a woman lose during the first 5–7 years following the final menstrual period (FMP)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2-3%",
                "Up to 10-20%",
                "Exactly 35%",
                "Bone loss does not accelerate until age 75"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'rapid phase' of bone loss occurs in early post-menopause, where women can lose as much as 20% of their bone density due to the sharp decline in estrogen-mediated osteoclast inhibition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "To stimulate 'Osteogenic Loading' and improve bone mineral density (BMD) in the femoral neck, research suggests the mechanical strain must reach approximately how many times the client's body weight?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 times body weight (walking)",
                "1.2 times body weight (light jogging)",
                "Over 4.2 times body weight (high-intensity loading/impact)",
                "Exactly 10 times body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, such as those involving the 'LIFTMOR' trial, suggest that high-intensity resistance and impact training (reaching 4.2+ multiples of body weight) are necessary to trigger significant bone remodeling in postmenopausal women."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is responsible for the 'carboxylation' of osteocalcin, ensuring that calcium is directed into the bone matrix rather than the arterial walls?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7)",
                "Vitamin E",
                "Boron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 activates osteocalcin (which binds calcium to bone) and Matrix Gla Protein (which prevents vascular calcification), making it a dual-action nutrient for heart and bone health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When assessing a client's cardiovascular risk, why is the 'Waist-to-Height Ratio' (WHtR) considered a superior metric to BMI in perimenopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "BMI does not account for the 'menopause belly' shift toward visceral adiposity",
                "WHtR measures bone density in the spine",
                "BMI is only accurate for men under the age of 40",
                "WHtR is a direct measurement of LDL particle size"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BMI fails to distinguish between muscle and fat or where fat is stored. Menopause causes a shift toward visceral fat (android fat distribution), which WHtR (target <0.5) identifies more accurately as a metabolic risk factor."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which supplement has been shown in clinical trials to reduce high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) and improve arterial stiffness in postmenopausal populations?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium Carbonate",
                "Iron Bisglycinate",
                "Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)",
                "Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-dose Omega-3 supplementation (2g+ of EPA/DHA) is evidence-based for reducing systemic inflammation (hs-CRP) and improving vascular compliance in aging women."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client presents with a DEXA T-score of -2.2 at the lumbar spine. How should you classify this and what is the appropriate coaching action?",
            "options": [
                "Normal bone density; continue standard yoga and walking",
                "Osteopenia; implement progressive resistance training and optimize Vitamin D/K2 while monitoring",
                "Osteoporosis; refer immediately for pharmacological intervention only",
                "Severe Osteoporosis; advise the client to avoid all physical activity to prevent fractures"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 is classified as Osteopenia. This is the 'window of opportunity' for lifestyle and nutritional interventions to prevent progression to Osteoporosis (-2.5 or lower)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Collaborative Care,' which of the following 'Red Flag' symptoms requires an immediate medical referral rather than a coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Mild night sweats twice a week",
                "Occasional forgetfulness or 'brain fog'",
                "New-onset exertional chest pain or shortness of breath",
                "A desire to change from a vegan to a paleo diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chest pain or shortness of breath during exertion are classic signs of potential cardiovascular distress or ischemia and must be evaluated by a physician immediately, especially given the increased risk profile in menopause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Why is adequate protein intake (1.2–1.5g/kg) considered essential for bone health, contradicting the outdated 'acid-ash' hypothesis?",
            "options": [
                "Protein makes the bones more flexible so they don't break",
                "Approximately 50% of bone volume and 1/3 of bone mass is composed of a protein (collagen) matrix",
                "Protein intake prevents the absorption of calcium, which is good for the heart",
                "Protein is the only nutrient that can reverse a T-score of -3.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bone is not just minerals; it is a living tissue with a massive collagen (protein) framework. Adequate protein is required to maintain this matrix and support IGF-1, which stimulates bone formation."
