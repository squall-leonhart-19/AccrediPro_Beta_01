            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "During the perimenopausal transition, why do levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) typically begin to rise and fluctuate significantly?",
            "options": [
                "The pituitary gland is overproducing FSH to compensate for declining ovarian sensitivity and low inhibin B.",
                "The hypothalamus stops producing Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH).",
                "High levels of progesterone trigger a positive feedback loop to the pituitary.",
                "The ovaries are producing too much estrogen, which stimulates FSH production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As ovarian reserve declines, the production of inhibin B decreases, removing the negative feedback on the pituitary. The pituitary then increases FSH production in an attempt to stimulate the aging follicles into ovulation."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Progesterone is known as 'The Great Stabilizer.' Which metabolite of progesterone is responsible for its sedative and anti-anxiety effects by modulating GABA-A receptors?",
            "options": [
                "Androstenedione",
                "Allopregnanolone",
                "Estrone",
                "Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent neurosteroid metabolite of progesterone that crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, promoting calm and sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) phenomenon discussed in Lesson 4, how does chronic stress impact sex hormone production?",
            "options": [
                "The body prioritizes estrogen production to protect the heart.",
                "Pregnenolone is diverted toward cortisol production at the expense of progesterone and DHEA.",
                "Cortisol is converted directly into testosterone to increase energy.",
                "Stress causes the ovaries to produce more progesterone to buffer the HPA axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the biochemical pathway prioritizes the production of life-sustaining cortisol. Because cortisol and sex hormones share the precursor pregnenolone, sex hormone synthesis (particularly progesterone) often suffers."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Phytoestrogens are described as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs). How do they typically behave in a high-estrogen environment?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the total estrogenic load by 100-fold.",
                "They bind to receptors and produce a stronger signal than estradiol.",
                "They act as weak antagonists, competing with estradiol for receptor sites and lowering overall estrogenic activity.",
                "They stimulate the ovaries to produce more endogenous estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a high-estrogen environment, phytoestrogens (which have lower potency than estradiol) occupy receptor sites, preventing stronger endogenous estrogens from binding, thereby exerting a net anti-estrogenic or 'leveling' effect."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of estrogen dominance. Her GI map shows elevated levels of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase. What does this indicate regarding her 'Estrobolome'?",
            "options": [
                "Her gut is efficiently eliminating all estrogen through the stool.",
                "The enzyme is de-conjugating estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation instead of excreted.",
                "She has a deficiency in gut bacteria that process phytoestrogens.",
                "Beta-glucuronidase is a healthy marker of high fiber intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is produced by certain gut bacteria. When elevated, it 'un-couples' the estrogen that the liver has already neutralized, allowing the active estrogen to be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream (enterohepatic circulation)."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary reason why xenoestrogens (like BPA and phthalates) are particularly disruptive to the endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "They are easily broken down by the liver in Phase I.",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors with higher affinity than natural estradiol.",
                "They are lipophilic and bioaccumulate in adipose tissue, leading to persistent hormonal signaling.",
                "They only affect the reproductive system and have no impact on the thyroid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are fat-soluble (lipophilic) and resistant to metabolic degradation. This allows them to store in body fat and provide a continuous, low-level estrogenic stimulus that disrupts the natural hormonal rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 8, which botanical is specifically recognized for its ability to modulate the HPO axis and support the luteal phase by suppressing excessive prolactin and supporting LH production?",
            "options": [
                "Black Cohosh (Actaea racemosa)",
                "Vitex agnus-castus (Chasteberry)",
                "Valerian Root",
                "St. John’s Wort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitex (Chasteberry) acts on the pituitary gland to inhibit prolactin and support the production of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), which in turn encourages the corpus luteum to produce progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A 47-year-old client reports 'flooding' (very heavy periods), breast tenderness, and worsening migraines just before her period. Which hormonal pattern is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen deficiency with high progesterone.",
                "Relative estrogen dominance due to declining progesterone levels.",
                "Low FSH and low LH.",
                "Complete cessation of estrogen production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heavy bleeding and breast tenderness are classic signs of estrogen dominance. In perimenopause, this is often 'relative,' meaning estrogen may be high or normal, but progesterone has dropped significantly, failing to oppose estrogen's effects on the endometrium."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In the liver's Phase I and Phase II detoxification of estrogen, which metabolite is considered the most 'DNA-damaging' or potentially carcinogenic if not properly methylated?",
            "options": [
                "2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH)",
                "16-alpha-hydroxyestrone (16-OH)",
                "4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH)",
                "Estriol (E3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 4-OH pathway is considered the 'red light' pathway because 4-hydroxyestrone can be converted into quinones that cause DNA damage. Proper methylation (Phase II) is required to neutralize this metabolite."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "After the final menstrual period, which form of estrogen becomes the dominant circulating type, primarily produced through the aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue?",
            "options": [
                "Estradiol (E2)",
                "Estrone (E1)",
                "Estriol (E3)",
                "Ethinyl Estradiol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Estradiol (E2) is the dominant estrogen during the reproductive years, Estrone (E1) becomes the primary circulating estrogen post-menopause, largely produced in fat cells via the enzyme aromatase."
