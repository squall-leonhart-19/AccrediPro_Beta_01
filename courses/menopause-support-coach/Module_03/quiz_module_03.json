            "question": "Which biological mechanism is primarily responsible for the shift from subcutaneous to visceral fat (VAT) during the menopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) activity in the abdominal region",
                "The downregulation of Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) in gluteofemoral tissue",
                "An increase in progesterone-driven thermogenesis",
                "The stabilization of the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The decline in estrogen leads to a downregulation of ERα in gluteofemoral (hip/thigh) fat and an increase in androgenic influence, which favors the storage of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the abdomen."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that during the menopausal transition, visceral fat mass can increase by as much as:",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "20-25%",
                "44-49%",
                "Over 75%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies, such as the SWAN study, have shown that visceral fat mass can increase by approximately 44% to 49% during the menopausal transition, regardless of total body weight changes."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'sarcopenic obesity.' Which of the following best describes her physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "High muscle mass masked by high body fat",
                "Low body weight with high bone density",
                "The loss of skeletal muscle mass coupled with an increase in adipose tissue",
                "Rapid weight loss due to extreme calorie restriction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarcopenic obesity is the specific combination of age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) and increased fat mass, which significantly lowers the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in menopause, what is the recommended protein intake per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 grams",
                "15-20 grams",
                "30-40 grams, including ~3g of Leucine",
                "50-60 grams, regardless of amino acid profile"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, menopausal women require a higher 'leucine threshold' (approx. 2.5-3g) to trigger MPS, which typically requires 30-40g of high-quality protein per meal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to circadian biology, why is insulin sensitivity significantly lower in the evening for menopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin secretion inhibits insulin release from the pancreas",
                "Cortisol levels are naturally at their highest at 8:00 PM",

                "The liver stops producing glucose at night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin and insulin have an inverse relationship; as melatonin rises to prepare the body for sleep, it inhibits insulin secretion, making the body less capable of processing glucose late at night."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "How does chronic cortisol elevation specifically contribute to the 'Meno-Belly'?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It stimulates gluconeogenesis and promotes fat storage specifically in the visceral region",
                "It enhances the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "It improves the sensitivity of GLUT4 transporters in muscle tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol triggers gluconeogenesis (creating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) and, in the presence of insulin, promotes fat storage in the omental (visceral) fat cells which have more glucocorticoid receptors."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, what was identified as a common cause of 'metabolic adaptation' where the thyroid slows down during weight loss attempts?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive protein consumption",
                "Chronic over-exercising combined with aggressive calorie restriction",
                "High intake of cruciferous vegetables",
                "Sleeping more than 8 hours per night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aggressive calorie restriction and over-exercising (Low Energy Availability) signal the thyroid to downregulate the conversion of T4 to the active T3 to conserve energy, halting weight loss."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) for protein is approximately _____%, compared to _____% for fats.",

                "5%; 15%",
                "10%; 10%",
                "20-30%; 0-3%",
                "50%; 25%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has the highest thermic effect, requiring 20-30% of its energy to be burned during digestion, whereas fats require very little energy (0-3%) to be processed."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When designing a Metabolic Reset Plan, which 'Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis' (NEAT) target is generally recommended for metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "2,000 steps per day",
                "Sitting for at least 10 hours to recover",
                "7,000 - 10,000 steps per day",
                "NEAT is irrelevant if the client performs HIIT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NEAT accounts for a significant portion of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). Maintaining 7,000-10,000 steps ensures the 'metabolic fire' stays lit outside of formal exercise sessions."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key 'Reset' strategy for a client with high fasting insulin and a waist-to-hip ratio > 0.85?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing carbohydrate intake to 60% of total calories",
                "Implementing a 12-14 hour overnight fast and prioritizing protein-first meals",
                "Focusing exclusively on long-duration steady-state cardio",
                "Eliminating all dietary fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For insulin resistance (indicated by high fasting insulin and waist-to-hip ratio), a moderate time-restricted feeding window and prioritizing protein to stabilize blood glucose are primary 'Reset' interventions."
