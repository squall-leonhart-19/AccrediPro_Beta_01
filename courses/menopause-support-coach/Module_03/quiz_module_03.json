            "question": "Which mechanism primarily explains why declining estrogen levels in perimenopause lead to decreased insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in the expression and translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane.",
                "An immediate increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) which slows glucose uptake.",
                "A total cessation of glucagon production in the pancreas.",
                "An increase in subcutaneous fat storage in the lower extremities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a vital role in glucose metabolism by upregulating the expression and translocation of GLUT4 transporters; as estrogen declines, the 'lock' on the cell becomes harder to open, leading to higher circulating insulin."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT), common in the 'Menopause Middle,' is considered more dangerous than subcutaneous fat because it:",
            "options": [
                "Is metabolically inert and does not respond to exercise.",
                "Secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha directly into the portal circulation.",
                "Prevents the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like Vitamin D.",
                "Has a lower density of cortisol receptors compared to hip fat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VAT is an active endocrine organ that secretes inflammatory cytokines directly into the portal vein, reaching the liver and driving systemic insulin resistance and systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "To overcome anabolic resistance and preserve lean mass during the menopausal transition, what is the evidence-based daily protein target recommended in the course?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 g/kg of body weight (The standard RDA).",
                "1.0 - 1.2 g/kg of body weight.",
                "1.6 - 2.2 g/kg of body weight.",
                "Exactly 50 grams per day regardless of body weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that menopausal women require higher protein intakes (1.6-2.2g/kg) to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) due to the loss of estrogen's anabolic effects."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "When calculating HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) for a client, what score generally indicates the onset of early insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "A score below 1.0.",
                "A score between 1.0 and 1.5.",
                "A score greater than 1.9.",
                "A score of exactly 0.5."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' is often cited as <1.0, a HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and >2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) notices significant spikes after lunch. Which 'food sequencing' strategy should a coach recommend to flatten the glucose curve?",
            "options": [
                "Eat carbohydrates first to provide immediate energy, followed by protein.",
                "Eat fiber/vegetables first, then protein and fats, and carbohydrates last.",
                "Mix all food groups together into a smoothie for faster digestion.",
                "Consume a high-sugar fruit before the meal to 'prime' the insulin response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Eating fiber first slows gastric emptying, while protein and fats stimulate GLP-1, significantly reducing the glucose excursion of the carbohydrates eaten at the end of the meal."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Metabolic flexibility is defined as the body's ability to:",

                "Perform yoga and high-intensity interval training in the same day.",
                "Efficiently switch between oxidizing glucose and oxidizing fatty acids based on availability.",
                "Maintain a constant heart rate regardless of exercise intensity.",
                "Digest gluten and dairy without any inflammatory response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the capacity to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability; insulin-resistant individuals often lose this, remaining 'stuck' in glucose-burning mode."

            "question": "Why is 'aggressive' Intermittent Fasting (e.g., 20:4 windows) often cautioned against for perimenopausal women with high stress?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an immediate and permanent drop in bone density.",
                "It can over-activate the HPA axis, leading to elevated cortisol and further VAT accumulation.",
                "It prevents the liver from producing any glucose during the day.",
                "Women lack the enzymes necessary to oxidize fat after 12 hours of fasting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is a time of neuroendocrine fragility; excessive fasting can act as a significant stressor, raising cortisol levels which ironically promotes visceral fat storage and muscle wasting."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of 0.85 or higher in women is the WHO-recognized threshold for substantially increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications."

            "question": "To optimize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a single meal, a menopausal woman should aim for how much of the amino acid Leucine?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Trigger' for older adults and menopausal women is typically 2.5 to 3.0 grams per meal to overcome anabolic resistance and signal the mTOR pathway for muscle repair."

                "The Total Cholesterol to LDL ratio.",
                "The Triglyceride to HDL ratio.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride/HDL ratio (in mg/dL) of >2.0 is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles (Pattern B)."
