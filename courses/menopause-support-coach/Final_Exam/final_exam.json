            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Menopause Method™, the 'I' stands for Inflammation Control. According to the course methodology, why is systemic inflammation a primary target during the perimenopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "Because estrogen is naturally pro-inflammatory and increases during menopause.",
                "Because the decline in estradiol leads to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α.",
                "Because inflammation is the only cause of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes).",
                "Because inflammation prevents the absorption of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. As levels decline, the body often sees a rise in pro-inflammatory markers such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), which exacerbate joint pain, brain fog, and metabolic dysfunction."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "When implementing the 'T' (Track Symptoms) phase of the methodology, which clinical tool is most appropriate for a coach to use to establish a baseline of symptom severity?",
            "options": [
                "The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)",
                "The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)",
                "The Daily Basal Body Temperature Log",
                "The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) is a validated tool used to assess the severity of aging-symptoms across three dimensions: somatic, psychological, and urogenital, making it ideal for tracking progress in the THRIVE method."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "Research indicates that during the menopausal transition, women may experience a decline in Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR). What is the average percentage decrease in RMR often cited in longitudinal studies of midlife women?",
            "options": [
                "1-2% per decade",
                "Around 10% over the transition period",
                "Over 25% due to hormonal shifts alone",
                "There is no measurable change in RMR during menopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 2021 meta-analysis and several longitudinal studies suggest that the combination of hormonal shifts and the loss of lean muscle mass (sarcopenia) leads to an average RMR decline of approximately 10% during the transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "Under the 'H' (Hormone Harmony) pillar, which 'hormone hijack' mechanism explains why high stress can worsen perimenopausal symptoms like irregular bleeding?",
            "options": [
                "The Insulin-Glucagon Flip",
                "The Cortisol Steal (Pregnenolone Steal)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase Inhibition",
                "The Melatonin-Serotonin Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Cortisol Steal' occurs when the body prioritizes the production of cortisol over progesterone in response to chronic stress, as they share the precursor pregnenolone. This exacerbates the estrogen/progesterone imbalance common in perimenopause."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "In the 'R' (Reset Metabolism) phase, what is the recommended daily protein intake for a menopausal woman to combat sarcopenia and support muscle protein synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "0.6g per kg of body weight",
                "0.8g per kg of body weight (Standard RDA)",

                "At least 3.0g per kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance in menopause, the standard RDA (0.8g/kg) is insufficient. Experts recommend 1.2g-1.6g/kg to maintain muscle mass and metabolic health."

                "Reduction in Deep Sleep (Slow Wave Sleep) and increased sleep fragmentation",
                "Total elimination of Stage 1 sleep",
                "Increased production of nighttime growth hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Declining progesterone levels (which has a sedative effect via GABA receptors) and night sweats lead to reduced Deep Sleep (SWS) and more frequent awakenings (fragmentation)."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE method utilizes the Trans-Theoretical Model (Stages of Change) to help clients move from contemplation to maintenance regarding their new lifestyle and identity."

        {
            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Brain Fog,' a common complaint in the Vitality Boost module. A 2022 study showed that estradiol affects which part of the brain responsible for executive function and working memory?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estradiol has a high density of receptors in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex; its decline is directly linked to the cognitive 'fog' and memory lapses reported by 60% of women in transition."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "In L2: Advanced Case Studies, a client with 'Estrogen Dominance' symptoms despite being in perimenopause is discussed. What is the primary physiological cause of this relative dominance?",
            "options": [
                "The body produces more estrogen than it did at age 20",
                "Anovulatory cycles leading to a lack of progesterone to oppose estrogen",
                "A complete failure of the adrenal glands",
                "The sudden disappearance of testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, cycles often become anovulatory (no egg released). Without ovulation, the corpus luteum does not form, and progesterone is not produced, leaving estrogen 'unopposed' even if estrogen levels are technically declining."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "Regarding the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis for HRT, when is the initiation of hormone therapy considered to have the most favorable benefit-risk ratio for cardiovascular health?",

                "Only after age 70",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "At least 15 years after the final menstrual period",
                "There is no 'window'; HRT is equally risky at all ages"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' suggests that starting HRT within 10 years of menopause or before age 60 provides cardiovascular protection, whereas starting much later may increase risks due to existing plaque."

            "id": "final_11",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GSM affects up to 50-70% of postmenopausal women. Unlike vasomotor symptoms, GSM symptoms (dryness, irritation, urinary issues) typically worsen over time without intervention."
