            "options": [
                "0.8g per kg of body weight",
                "1.0g per kg of body weight",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that aging women require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5g/kg) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis effectively compared to younger populations due to anabolic resistance."

            "question": "Why is the 'Estrobolome' a critical consideration for a Menopause Support Coach when addressing a client's hormonal balance?",
            "options": [
                "It is the gland responsible for producing progesterone in the absence of ovulation.",
                "It is a collection of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing and recycling estrogens via beta-glucuronidase.",
                "It is a specific type of phytoestrogen found in flaxseeds.",
                "It is the measurement of estrogen levels in the bloodstream."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome refers to the gut bacteria that produce beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which supplement carries a significant risk of interaction with the CYP3A4 enzyme pathway, potentially reducing the efficacy of medications like birth control or blood thinners?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme (specifically CYP3A4), which can rapidly clear various medications from the system, rendering them ineffective."

            "question": "As estrogen levels decline, the body's 'thirst threshold' changes. What is the physiological result of this change in the hypothalamus?",
            "options": [
                "An increased urge to drink water even when hydrated.",
                "A delayed thirst response, leading to a higher risk of subclinical dehydration.",
                "An increase in total body water volume.",
                "A decrease in the production of Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Declining estrogen reduces the sensitivity of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, meaning menopausal women may not feel thirsty until they are already significantly dehydrated."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "When creating a personalized nutrition plan for a perimenopausal client experiencing insulin resistance, what is the recommended strategy for carbohydrate management?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To manage insulin sensitivity, coaches should recommend complex carbohydrates paired with protein and fiber, ideally timed after exercise when GLUT4 receptors are most active."

                "Lack of Vitamin K2 and Vitamin D3",
                "Excessive intake of Vitamin C",

                "High intake of saturated fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Calcium requires Vitamin D3 for intestinal absorption and Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) to direct that calcium into the bone matrix rather than the soft tissues/arteries."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Only about 30-50% of Westerners have the specific gut microbiota required to produce equol, which explains why soy products have varying levels of efficacy for different clients."
