            "question": "In Lesson 1, the concept of 'Interoceptive Awareness' is central to symptom tracking. What does this term specifically refer to in a coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to diagnose medical conditions based on physical sensations",
                "The physiological capacity to perceive and interpret internal bodily signals",
                "The use of wearable technology to track external environmental triggers",
                "The psychological process of suppressing symptoms to improve daily function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. In menopause coaching, improving a client's interoceptive awareness allows them to better identify and communicate the subtle shifts in their hormonal health."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During the 'Perimenopause Pivot' (Lesson 2), what is the primary hormonal driver behind the irregular cycles and heavy bleeding often reported by clients?",
            "options": [
                "A steady and linear increase in testosterone levels",
                "The complete cessation of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) production",
                "Anovulatory cycles leading to estrogen dominance and progesterone deficiency",
                "A consistent decrease in Luteinizing Hormone (LH) throughout the month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is characterized by erratic estrogen levels and a decline in progesterone due to frequent anovulatory cycles (cycles where no egg is released), leading to the 'pivot' in cycle regularity and flow."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, how do Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) typically impact sleep architecture in menopausal women?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the duration of REM sleep to compensate for daytime fatigue",
                "They cause 'micro-arousals' that specifically reduce the amount of Slow-Wave Sleep (Deep Sleep)",
                "They have no measurable effect on sleep stages, only on sleep onset latency",
                "They prevent the body from entering Stage 1 sleep entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hot flashes and night sweats trigger the sympathetic nervous system, causing micro-arousals that fragment sleep and significantly reduce Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS), which is critical for physical recovery."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Brain Fog' is described as a bioenergetic crisis. What is the underlying mechanism related to estrogen decline?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen decline leads to an over-reliance on glucose in the prefrontal cortex",
                "Estrogen is required for the brain to effectively metabolize ketones",
                "Estrogen regulates glucose transport and metabolism in the brain; its decline reduces cellular energy",
                "Estrogen decline causes the brain to shrink by approximately 15% during perimenopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a key role in brain glucose metabolism. When levels drop, the brain's ability to generate energy from glucose is compromised, leading to the cognitive symptoms known as 'brain fog.'"

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses metabolic changes. A 2023 study cited in the module indicates that women may experience what percentage increase in visceral fat during the menopause transition?",
            "options": [
                "2-5%",
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",
                "40-50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that even without significant weight gain, the hormonal shift toward menopause causes a redistribution of fat, with visceral (abdominal) fat increasing by approximately 10-15%."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When performing an Environmental Trigger Analysis (Lesson 6), why is alcohol consumption specifically tracked in relation to night sweats?",
            "options": [
                "Alcohol acts as a potent estrogen agonist, raising core body temperature",
                "Alcohol induces vasodilation and disrupts the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus",
                "Alcohol increases progesterone levels, which triggers the sweat glands",
                "Alcohol prevents the absorption of Vitamin E, the primary regulator of hot flashes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alcohol is a vasodilator and interferes with the hypothalamus's ability to regulate temperature, making it a common and significant trigger for vasomotor symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Regarding Lesson 7 on Lab Interpretation, why is a single FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) test often inconclusive for a client in her mid-40s?",
            "options": [
                "FSH levels only rise after a woman has been postmenopausal for five years",
                "FSH levels are suppressed by common multivitamins",
                "FSH fluctuates wildly day-to-day during perimenopause and does not provide a stable snapshot",
                "FSH is only accurate if measured at exactly 2:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, FSH levels can be in the postmenopausal range one day and the premenopausal range the next. A single test is a 'snapshot' that may not reflect the overall hormonal trend."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the THRIVE™ Symptom Dashboard (Lesson 8), what are the three primary metrics recommended for tracking any specific symptom?",
            "options": [
                "Frequency, Intensity, and Duration",
                "Cost, Severity, and Location",
                "Onset, Resolution, and Medication Use",
                "Mood, Weight, and Temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE™ methodology emphasizes tracking the Frequency (how often), Intensity (how bad), and Duration (how long) to provide a comprehensive view of symptom impact."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client, Maria (48), reports high anxiety and 'heart palpitations' that occur mostly in the evening. Based on Lesson 4, which neurochemical shift is likely contributing to this?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Dopamine sensitivity",
                "A decline in GABAergic activity and an imbalance in the GABA/Glutamate ratio",
                "The overproduction of Melatonin in the evening hours",
                "A sudden surge in Oxytocin levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates GABA, the brain's primary inhibitory (calming) neurotransmitter. As estrogen declines, GABAergic activity often drops, leading to increased anxiety and physical symptoms of stress."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Scope of Practice' boundary emphasized in Lesson 7 for Menopause Support Coaches interpreting lab data?",
            "options": [
                "Coaches should prescribe specific doses of HRT based on FSH results",
                "Coaches should use lab data to educate the client and facilitate better conversations with their doctor",
                "Coaches should tell clients to ignore their doctor's advice if labs look normal",
                "Coaches are responsible for diagnosing thyroid disorders if the TSH is above 4.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach's role is to help the client understand what the markers mean and empower them to communicate effectively with their medical provider, not to diagnose or prescribe."
