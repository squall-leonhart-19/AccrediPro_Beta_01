            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is often the first hormone to decline significantly due to more frequent anovulatory cycles, while estrogen may remain high or fluctuate wildly during early perimenopause."

            "explanation": "Modern research, including re-analysis of the WHI study, shows that for most healthy women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause onset, the benefits of HRT typically outweigh the risks, debunking the myth that it is universally dangerous."
