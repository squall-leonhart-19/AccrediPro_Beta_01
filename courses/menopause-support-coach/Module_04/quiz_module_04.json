            "question": "Which biological process best describes 'Inflammaging' as it relates to the menopausal transition?",
            "options": [
                "An acute immune response to bacterial infection during perimenopause",
                "A chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammatory state characterized by elevated cytokines in the absence of overt infection",
                "The rapid increase of estrogen levels leading to autoimmune flare-ups",
                "A localized inflammatory response confined strictly to the reproductive tissues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammaging is the age-related increase in systemic inflammatory markers (like IL-6 and TNF-alpha) that is significantly accelerated by the loss of estrogen's protective effects during menopause."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Estrogen acts as an 'anti-inflammatory shield' primarily by inhibiting which of the following transcription factors?",
            "options": [
                "mTOR",
                "FOXO3",

                "PPAR-gamma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen (specifically Estradiol) interferes with the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is the 'master switch' for producing pro-inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client's blood work shows a High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) level of 3.8 mg/L. Based on the assessment criteria in Lesson 3, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal/Low Risk (< 1.0 mg/L)",
                "Average Risk (1.0 - 3.0 mg/L)",

                "Acute Infection/Trauma (> 10.0 mg/L)"            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP level above 3.0 mg/L is categorized as high risk for systemic inflammation and cardiovascular issues, common in the menopausal transition."

                "4:1 or lower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet is often 15:1 or 20:1, the goal for inflammation control is a ratio of 4:1 or lower to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, 'The Big Three' pro-inflammatory triggers that coaches must address are:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many factors contribute, Stress (cortisol), Sleep (cytokine regulation), and Refined Sugar (insulin/glycation) are the primary systemic drivers of the 'inflammatory load' in menopause."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Curcumin is fat-soluble and poorly absorbed; piperine can increase its bioavailability by up to 2,000%, while fats aid in intestinal absorption."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "What is the primary function of the 'Estrobolome' in the context of gut-driven inflammation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is a subset of the gut microbiome that produces beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "If a client has high levels of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, what is the likely impact on her hormone-driven inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "She will excrete too much estrogen, leading to deficiency",
                "She will have improved gut motility and lower inflammation",
                "She may experience 'estrogen dominance' symptoms as deactivated estrogen is reactivated and recirculated",
                "Her body will stop producing cortisol entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High beta-glucuronidase prevents the excretion of 'used' estrogen, leading to recirculation which can exacerbate inflammatory symptoms and hormonal imbalances."

                "The 'Supplements First' Approach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Crowding Out' method focuses on adding high-nutrient, anti-inflammatory foods first, which naturally displaces pro-inflammatory triggers without the psychological stress of deprivation."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 5 indicates that a single night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) can increase which inflammatory marker by up to 40%?",
