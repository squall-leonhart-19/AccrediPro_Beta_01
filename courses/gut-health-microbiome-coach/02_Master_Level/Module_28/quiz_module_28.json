            "question": "During the Clinical Triage process (L1), which of the following 'Red Flag' symptoms necessitates an immediate medical referral before proceeding with gut health coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Bloating occurring 30 minutes after meals",
                "Unintentional weight loss of >10% body mass in 3-6 months",
                "Occasional constipation alternating with loose stools",
                "Mild histamine reactions to fermented foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unintentional weight loss of over 10% in a short period is a significant red flag for underlying pathology, such as malignancy or severe inflammatory bowel disease, requiring immediate medical investigation."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "According to the Non-Responder Protocol (L2), if a client shows zero progress after 12 weeks of evidence-based intervention, what is the most likely hidden 'barrier to resolution' that should be investigated?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient fiber intake",
                "Pathogenic biofilms or sequestered infections",
                "Lack of high-strain probiotics",
                "Excessive water consumption during meals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biofilms can protect pathogens from both natural antimicrobials and antibiotics, often serving as the primary reason for stalled progress in complex gut cases."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In the management of severe inflammatory flares (L3), a Fecal Calprotectin level of >250 μg/g is generally interpreted as:",
            "options": [
                "Normal range for healthy adults",
                "Indicative of mild Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)",
                "A clear marker of active organic inflammation (e.g., IBD flare)",
                "An indicator of protein malabsorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fecal calprotectin is a sensitive marker for intestinal inflammation; levels above 250 μg/g are strongly associated with active IBD flares rather than functional disorders like IBS."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which clinical feature most accurately distinguishes Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) from simple Histamine Intolerance (HIT) in a complex case (L4)?",
            "options": [
                "MCAS involves only the gastrointestinal tract",
                "HIT is triggered by stress, while MCAS is only triggered by food",
                "MCAS involves multi-systemic symptoms (skin, respiratory, GI, neurological) often triggered by non-food stimuli",
                "HIT requires the use of EpiPens, whereas MCAS does not"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MCAS is characterized by systemic mast cell degranulation affecting multiple organ systems, whereas Histamine Intolerance is primarily a metabolic deficiency of the DAO or HMNT enzymes."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In neurological crises (L5), how does the 'Vagal Tone' influence the inflammatory response in the gut?",
            "options": [
                "Low vagal tone increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha",
                "High vagal tone suppresses the production of Short Chain Fatty Acids",
                "Vagal tone has no impact on systemic inflammation",
                "Low vagal tone accelerates gastric emptying, causing diarrhea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, mediated by the vagus nerve, normally inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; low vagal tone is a common feature in complex neuro-gut cases."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client who has undergone an ileocecal valve (ICV) resection is at significantly higher risk for which structural complexity (L6)?",
            "options": [
                "Gastroparesis",
                "Chronic Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) due to retrograde flow",
                "Increased stomach acid production",
                "Rapid weight gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ileocecal valve acts as a barrier; its removal or dysfunction allows colonic bacteria to migrate back into the small intestine, leading to recurrent SIBO."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "Research discussed in L7 regarding Polypharmacy indicates that Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) affect the microbiome primarily by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing microbial diversity by 40%",
                "Reducing alpha-diversity and increasing the risk of C. difficile infection",
                "Acting as a powerful prebiotic for Bifidobacteria",
                "Preventing the translocation of LPS"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PPIs alter the pH of the GI tract, which significantly reduces microbial diversity and removes the 'acid barrier,' making the host more susceptible to enteric infections like C. diff."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "In the Case Formulation for Multi-Morbidity (L8), what is defined as a 'Precipitating Factor'?",
            "options": [
                "The genetic predisposition to autoimmunity",
                "The 'trigger' event that initiated the current crisis (e.g., acute infection or severe trauma)",
                "The lifestyle habits that keep the client sick",
                "The long-term nutrient deficiencies present since childhood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Precipitating factors are the specific events or 'triggers' that transition a patient from a state of compensated health to an active symptomatic crisis."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that in 'Non-Responders' with IBS, what percentage were found to have underlying hypermobility/Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome affecting gut motility?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Up to 30% in specialized tertiary clinics",
                "Over 80% of all cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Structural connective tissue disorders like hEDS are significantly overrepresented in complex, non-responding GI populations, often reaching 30% in clinical cohorts."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "When managing a severe IBD flare (L3), what is the primary goal of the 'Low-Residue' dietary phase?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize fiber intake to feed butyrate producers",
                "To reduce mechanical irritation of the inflamed bowel wall and decrease stool volume",
                "To induce ketosis for anti-inflammatory effects",
                "To eliminate all carbohydrates to starve pathogens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During an acute flare, the priority is to reduce the mechanical 'friction' of undigested fiber against the ulcerated or inflamed mucosa to allow for tissue healing."
