            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "During the Strategic Client Intake (L1), which document is considered the 'North Star' for identifying the intersection of physiological triggers and life events?",
            "options": [
                "The 3-Day Food Diary",
                "The Functional Medicine Timeline",
                "The Bristol Stool Scale Log",
                "The Supplement Interference Matrix"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Functional Medicine Timeline allows the coach to map 'Antecedents, Triggers, and Mediators' (ATMs) against a chronological history to find root cause patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "According to the Multi-Phased Protocol logic (L2), why is the 'Remove' phase typically initiated before the 'Repair' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To save the client money on expensive mucosal supports",
                "Because mucosal repair nutrients like L-Glutamine can feed pathogenic overgrowth",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before starting gut healing",
                "Pathogens and biofilms prevent the absorption of all amino acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In many cases, providing 'building blocks' like L-Glutamine or collagen while high levels of dysbiosis or SIBO are present can inadvertently support the metabolism of pathogenic bacteria or worsen symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When integrating functional testing (L3), a GI-MAP shows high levels of Beta-glucuronidase (e.g., >2500 U/mL). What is the primary clinical implication for the program logic?",
            "options": [
                "The client has a protein deficiency",
                "The client is at risk for impaired estrogen detoxification and recycling",
                "The client needs immediate high-dose probiotic therapy",
                "The client is reacting to gluten and needs a Celiac panel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Beta-glucuronidase indicates the gut microbiome is 'un-coupling' toxins and hormones (like estrogen) that were meant for excretion, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In Advanced Supplement Tiering (L4), which of the following represents a 'Tier 3' (Targeted/Therapeutic) intervention rather than a Tier 1 (Foundational) intervention?",

                "Magnesium Glycinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tier 1 focuses on foundational nutrient gaps. Tier 3 involves specific, potent compounds used for a limited duration to address a specific clinical finding, such as biofilms."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "Compliance Engineering (L5) suggests that 'Decision Fatigue' is a primary reason for protocol failure. What is the most effective way to reduce this for a client?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a 50-page manual of all possible gut-friendly foods",
                "Using 'Choice Architecture' to pre-select 3 breakfast options for the first 14 days",

                "Giving the client the freedom to choose any supplement brand they find on sale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing choices (Choice Architecture) lowers the cognitive load on the client, making it easier to stick to the protocol during the difficult early stages."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "When scaling to a Group Coaching framework (L6), what is the 'Social Proof' statistic often cited regarding health outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "Group participants are 50% more likely to reach goals due to peer accountability",
                "Individual coaching is always 10x more effective than group coaching",
                "Group coaching reduces the coach's income by 20% per hour",
                "Group coaching is only effective for weight loss, not gut health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Peer accountability and the 'normalization' of symptoms/healing in a group setting significantly increase adherence and success rates compared to isolated efforts."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "In Data-Driven Iteration (L7), a client's 'Symptom Burden Score' has plateaued for 3 weeks despite 90% compliance. What is the first recommended action?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately double the dosage of all supplements",

                "Tell the client they are likely not being honest about their diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A plateau often indicates that an unaddressed 'Mediator' (like environmental toxins or nervous system dysregulation) is preventing further progress with the current gut-centric protocol."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "Under the Legal Frameworks (L8), which of the following statements is a Gut Health Coach legally permitted to say in the United States?",

                "'You should stop taking your Metformin because we are fixing your gut.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must use 'structure-function' language (support, maintain, promote) and cannot diagnose, treat, or prescribe for specific diseases."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "Which nutrient synergy (L4) is most critical when high-dose Zinc is used for intestinal permeability repair over a period longer than 4 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc and Vitamin C",
                "Zinc and Copper balance (typically a 15:1 ratio)",

                "Zinc and Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term high-dose zinc supplementation can induce a copper deficiency, so maintaining the correct ratio is essential for preventing secondary issues like anemia or neutropenia."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "A client with 'Silent Reflux' (LRP) and bloating fails to improve during the 'Replace' phase (HCL/Enzymes). What does the Program Logic (L3/L7) suggest as the next step?",
            "options": [
                "Triple the dose of HCL",
                "Switch to a liquid-only diet for 30 days",

                "Ignore the symptoms and continue the protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a client reacts poorly to HCL (burning or no relief), it is a clinical indicator of a compromised gastric lining (gastritis) or an active H. Pylori infection that must be addressed before adding acid."
