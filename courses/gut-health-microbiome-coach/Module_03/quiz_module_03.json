        {
            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which protein is the primary physiological modulator of tight junctions, and when overexpressed, leads to increased paracellular permeability?",
            "options": ["Occludin", "Zonulin", "Claudin-1", "Vinculin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels of zonulin, often triggered by gluten (gliadin) or dysbiosis, lead to the 'opening' of the intestinal barrier."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Metabolic endotoxemia is characterized by a 2-3 fold increase in circulating levels of which bacterial component?",
            "options": ["Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)", "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)", "Peptidoglycans", "Flagellin"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia occurs when LPS (from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria) crosses the intestinal barrier into the bloodstream, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation via TLR4 activation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total immune system is housed within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": ["30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GALT is the largest component of the immune system, containing roughly 70-80% of the body's immune cells, including T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Butyrate is a critical SCFA because it serves as the primary energy source for colonocytes. What percentage of a colonocyte's energy requirement is typically met by butyrate?",
            "options": ["~30%", "~50%", "~70%", "~90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel source for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes), providing approximately 70% of their total energy needs through mitochondrial oxidation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "The metabolite Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Which dietary components are the primary precursors for bacterial TMA production?",
            "options": ["Fructose and Glucose", "Choline and L-carnitine", "Saturated fats and Cholesterol", "Tryptophan and Tyrosine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut bacteria metabolize choline (found in eggs/dairy) and L-carnitine (found in red meat) into TMA, which the liver then oxidizes into TMAO, a marker for atherosclerosis risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A stool test showing a pH above 7.5, high ammonia, and elevated branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) is most indicative of which process?",
            "options": ["Optimal saccharolytic fermentation", "Excessive proteolytic fermentation", "Fat malabsorption", "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proteolytic fermentation (the breakdown of protein by bacteria) produces alkaline byproducts like ammonia and BCFAs (isobutyrate, isovalerate), which raise the stool pH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In the Gut-Microbiome-Skin axis, how do SCFAs primarily exert an anti-inflammatory effect on skin conditions like psoriasis?",
            "options": ["By increasing sebum production", "By inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs)", "By stimulating the production of Substance P", "By decreasing melanin synthesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs, particularly butyrate, act as HDAC inhibitors. This epigenetic mechanism suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes the expansion of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which calms skin inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'gold standard' for non-invasively differentiating between Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)?",
            "options": ["Fecal Elastase", "Secretory IgA (sIgA)", "Fecal Calprotectin", "Steatocrit"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils during inflammation. High levels (>250 µg/g) strongly suggest IBD, while low levels are typical in functional disorders like IBS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Which SCFA is primarily transported to the liver via the portal vein to serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis?",
            "options": ["Acetate", "Butyrate", "Propionate", "Valerate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While butyrate is used by the colon and acetate enters systemic circulation, propionate is largely cleared by the liver, where it contributes to glucose production (gluconeogenesis)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "A client presents with low Secretory IgA (sIgA) on a functional stool test. What is the most likely clinical implication of this finding?",
            "options": ["Overactive immune response to food antigens", "Reduced first-line mucosal defense and increased infection risk", "High levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria", "Excessive fiber intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "sIgA is the primary antibody of the mucosal immune system. Low levels indicate a 'depleted' mucosal barrier, making the client more susceptible to pathogens and environmental triggers."
