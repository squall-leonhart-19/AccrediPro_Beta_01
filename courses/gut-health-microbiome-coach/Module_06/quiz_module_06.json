            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is synthesized within the gut by enterochromaffin cells, highlighting the scale of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "50-60%",
                "70-75%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, where it regulates gastrointestinal motility and communicates with the central nervous system via the vagus nerve."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia occurs when Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria translocate through a 'leaky' gut barrier into the bloodstream, triggering systemic low-grade inflammation."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In the context of the Estrobolome, what is the primary mechanism by which dysbiosis leads to estrogen dominance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome produces the enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid. This deconjugation allows 'spent' estrogen to be reabsorbed into circulation rather than excreted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines postbiotics as 'non-viable' or 'inanimate' microbes or their components (like butyrate or cell wall fragments) that provide a health benefit to the host."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown a significantly higher prevalence of SIBO in patients with Rosacea. Eradication of SIBO often leads to a marked improvement or complete resolution of rosacea skin lesions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fecal Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils during inflammation. Levels above 50-100 µg/g suggest mucosal inflammation, helping clinicians distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease and functional disorders like IBS."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circadian disruption (like jet lag) eliminates the normal 24-hour fluctuations in microbial composition, often leading to dysbiosis characterized by an increase in Proteobacteria and metabolic dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin increases intestinal permeability, allowing LPS to enter the blood. This systemic inflammation can then compromise the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to neuroinflammation and 'brain fog'."
