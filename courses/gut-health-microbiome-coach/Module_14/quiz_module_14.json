            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "What percentage of the body's total immune system cells are estimated to reside within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 50-60%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Over 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently indicates that the GALT contains roughly 70-80% of the body's total immune cells, making the gut the primary site of immune education and surveillance."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the mechanism of molecular mimicry, which specific pathogen has been structurally linked to the development of Ankylosing Spondylitis due to its similarity to the HLA-B27 marker?",
            "options": [
                "Klebsiella pneumoniae",
                "Citrobacter freundii",
                "Proteus mirabilis",
                "Porphyromonas gingivalis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Klebsiella pneumoniae shares structural similarities with the HLA-B27 molecule. Through molecular mimicry, the immune response against the bacteria can cross-react with host tissues, leading to Ankylosing Spondylitis."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client presents with flushing, migraines, and hives after consuming red wine and aged balsamic vinegar. If the issue is Histamine Intolerance (HIT) rather than MCAS, which enzyme deficiency is most likely responsible for failing to degrade extracellular histamine?",
            "options": [
                "Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT)",
                "Diamine Oxidase (DAO)",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Tyramine decarboxylase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diamine Oxidase (DAO) is the primary enzyme responsible for the breakdown of ingested (extracellular) histamine in the digestive tract. HNMT primarily handles intracellular histamine."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the aggregate of enteric bacterial genes whose products are capable of metabolizing estrogens. Which microbial enzyme, when elevated, deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-galactosidase",
                "Sulfatase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Urease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid. This 'deconjugation' prevents the estrogen from being excreted in the stool and allows it to re-enter the bloodstream, potentially leading to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on mycotoxins, which specific toxin is known to inhibit protein synthesis and directly downregulate the expression of 'tight junction' proteins like Claudin-1 and Occludin?",
            "options": [
                "Aflatoxin B1",
                "Deoxynivalenol (DON/Vomitoxin)",
                "Fumonisin B1",
                "Ochratoxin A"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a potent trichothecene mycotoxin that targets the intestinal barrier by inhibiting protein synthesis and specifically reducing the expression of tight junction proteins, leading to 'leaky gut'."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the primary advantage of using 'Phage Therapy' (such as PreforPro) over traditional broad-spectrum prebiotics?",
            "options": [
                "Phages provide a bulk fiber source for all commensal bacteria",
                "Phages selectively target and lyse specific pathogenic bacteria like E. coli without inducing gas or bloating",
                "Phages act as a direct fuel source for Bifidobacteria only",
                "Phages increase the acidity of the colon to kill all Gram-negative bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bacteriophages are highly specific viruses that target only certain bacterial species (like E. coli). Unlike fiber-based prebiotics, they do not require fermentation, thus avoiding the gas and bloating often seen in sensitive clients."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In pediatric gut health, why is Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001 considered a keystone strain compared to other Bifidobacteria?",
            "options": [
                "It produces the highest amount of Vitamin K2",
                "It is the only strain that can survive stomach acid in infants",
                "It possesses the full gene cassette required to ferment all 200+ Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs)",
                "It directly neutralizes gluten proteins in the infant gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "B. infantis is unique because it can utilize the full spectrum of HMOs found in breast milk, ensuring it outcompetes potential pathogens and properly 'seeds' the infant microbiome."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "When integrating Tier 1 Clinical Protocols, if a client has low Secretory IgA (sIgA) and high fecal fat (steatorrhea), which intervention should be prioritized according to the 'Replace' phase?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose Vitamin A to boost sIgA",
                "Digestive enzymes and bile acid support",
                "Broad-spectrum herbal antimicrobials",
                "Daily intake of fermented sauerkraut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the 'Replace' phase, addressing malabsorption (steatorrhea) with digestive enzymes or bile support is a priority to ensure the client can absorb the nutrients (like Vitamin A) needed to eventually support sIgA production."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Which immunoglobulin is considered the 'first line of defense' in the gut mucosa, performing 'immune exclusion' by binding to pathogens before they can attach to epithelial cells?",
            "options": [
                "IgG",
                "IgE",
                "Secretory IgA (sIgA)",
                "IgM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "sIgA is the primary mucosal antibody. Its main role is immune exclusion—binding to bacteria, toxins, and viruses in the lumen to prevent them from adhering to and invading the intestinal lining."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module demonstrated that a specific 'Precision Fiber' increased Butyrate production by 35% without increasing gas. Which fiber was this?",
            "options": [
                "Inulin",
                "Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum (PHGG)",
                "Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)",
                "Psyllium Husk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PHGG is frequently cited as a 'precision' or 'low-gas' fiber because its slow fermentation rate allows for significant butyrate production without the rapid gas expansion associated with inulin or FOS."
