            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing a specific medical condition (Crohn's) and prescribing a treatment for that disease is a direct violation of the scope of practice for non-licensed practitioners. Coaches must educate and support, not diagnose or treat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the EU, the term 'probiotic' is interpreted as a health claim (implying a health benefit). To date, very few claims have been authorized, effectively banning the term from most labels and marketing in many EU jurisdictions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires that if a testimonial is not representative of what the average consumer will achieve, the 'typical' results must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. Vague disclaimers like 'Results not typical' are no longer considered sufficient."
