                "The specificity of the pain point combined with the client's urgency to solve it",

                "The availability of low-cost probiotic supplements in that niche"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high-value niche is defined by the intersection of a specific, high-intensity pain point and a client's willingness/urgency to invest in a specialized solution, rather than just the size of the general market."

                "That the coach guarantees a 100% cure rate for IBS symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Scope of Practice' waiver is the cornerstone of risk mitigation, clearly distinguishing health coaching from the practice of medicine to avoid 'unlicensed practice of medicine' charges."

                "Clients prefer to pay every 60 minutes",
                "Hourly billing is illegal in most jurisdictions for health coaches"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing creates a 'time-for-money' trap. Premium pricing should be 'Value-Based,' focusing on the total transformation and the clinical outcome provided by the package."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most sustainable partnerships are bi-directional and complementary, where the coach fills the 'implementation gap' (dietary and lifestyle changes) that clinical practitioners often cannot manage."
