                "The 'Placebo Group Effect' which bypasses the need for dietary changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social connection triggers oxytocin release, which has been shown to lower systemic inflammation and support the gut-brain axis, making participants more resilient to the stress of lifestyle changes."

                "To ensure participants have already stabilized their microbiome to handle high doses of live cultures",
                "Because fermentation requires expensive equipment that takes weeks to ship",
                "To prevent participants from quitting early due to the 'die-off' symptoms of probiotics",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Introducing high-potency ferments too early can cause 'die-off' reactions (Herxheimer) or exacerbate symptoms in sensitive individuals. Stabilizing the gut first ensures better tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In digital challenge settings, cognitive load must be managed; 7-12 minute 'micro-lessons' result in significantly higher engagement and retention than long-form webinars."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A salt concentration of 2-3% is the standard safety threshold for lacto-fermentation to favor beneficial lactic acid bacteria while inhibiting pathogens."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
