            "question": "A client presents with a stool test report and asks you to 'prescribe' a protocol to cure their diagnosed Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). What is the ethically correct response according to the Scope of Practice guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a specific herbal antibiotic protocol based on the latest research.",
                "Explain that as a coach, you provide education and lifestyle support, and they must consult their physician for medical treatment.",
                "Interpret the test results as a definitive diagnosis and provide a meal plan.",
                "Adjust their current medication dosage to better align with the microbiome findings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coaches must clearly distinguish between 'prescribing/treating' and 'educating/supporting.' Diagnosing and treating medical conditions like SIBO is outside the coaching scope of practice."

        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "Which of the following best defines the 'Diagnostic Trap' in microbiome testing interpretation?",

                "Suggesting a client eat more fiber to increase short-chain fatty acid production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Diagnostic Trap occurs when a coach uses non-diagnostic, direct-to-consumer microbiome tests to 'diagnose' a clinical pathology, which is both scientifically inaccurate and ethically improper."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Under the principle of 'Supplement Stewardship,' what is the coach's primary responsibility when recommending probiotics?",
            "options": [
                "Recommending the highest CFU count available to ensure maximum colonization.",
                "Ensuring the recommendation is based on strain-specific evidence relevant to the client's goals.",
                "Providing at least five different brands to ensure the client gets a variety of species.",
                "Always recommending the coach's own private-label brand to ensure quality control."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supplement stewardship requires recommending probiotics based on strain-specific clinical evidence (Human Clinical Trials) rather than generic species or high CFU counts without evidence."

        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Evidence-Based Practice vs. Microbiome Hype,' what level of evidence is considered the 'Gold Standard' for making clinical recommendations?",

                "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).",
                "Expert opinion and case reports from other health coaches."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The hierarchy of evidence places systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs at the top, providing the most reliable data for interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "When a client shares raw genomic or microbiome data (FASTQ files) with a coach, what is a critical ethical consideration regarding data privacy?",
            "options": [
                "Raw data is anonymous and carries no risk of re-identification.",
                "The coach should store this data on a public cloud drive for easy access.",
                "The coach must inform the client that even 'de-identified' genomic data carries a risk of re-identification via 'genetic genealogy.'",
                "Coaches are legally allowed to sell this data to research firms without further consent."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the genomic age, coaches must ensure informed consent includes the risk that genomic data is uniquely identifying and can potentially be linked back to the individual."

        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "If a client exhibits signs of 'Orthorexia Nervosa'—an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating—what is the coach's ethical obligation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches have an ethical duty to 'do no harm.' When disordered eating patterns are suspected, immediate referral to a mental health specialist is mandatory."

                "Mild fatigue after a course of antibiotics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rectal bleeding or melena (tarry stools) are clinical red flags for serious underlying pathology (like IBD or malignancy) and require immediate medical evaluation."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Financial Ethics, what is the most transparent way to handle affiliate commissions from supplement companies?",
            "options": [
                "Do not mention the commission unless the client specifically asks.",
                "Include a written disclosure in the initial contract and verbally mention the conflict of interest when recommending the product.",
                "Only recommend products that do not offer commissions to avoid any conflict.",
                "Increase the price of the coaching package to cover the cost of the supplements."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Full transparency through written and verbal disclosure is the ethical standard for managing financial conflicts of interest, such as affiliate commissions."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A 2023 review of direct-to-consumer microbiome tests found that many companies use 'proprietary algorithms.' Why is this an ethical concern for coaches?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the tests more expensive for the client.",
                "The lack of transparency prevents independent validation of the health scores provided.",
                "Proprietary algorithms are always more accurate than open-source ones.",
                "It prevents the coach from earning a commission on the test."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires 'transparency.' If a coach cannot see how a health score is calculated, they cannot verify its scientific validity, leading to potential misinformation."

        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "When working with a 'Vulnerable Population,' such as an elderly client with multiple comorbidities, what is the primary ethical concern regarding microbiome interventions?",

                "The potential for 'poly-pharmacy' interactions and the risk of bacteremia from certain probiotic strains.",
                "The client's inability to follow complex dietary instructions.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In vulnerable populations like the elderly or immunocompromised, the risk of adverse events (like probiotic-induced sepsis or drug-nutrient interactions) is significantly higher, requiring extreme caution and medical oversight."
