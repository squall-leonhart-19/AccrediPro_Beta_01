            "question": "According to the AccrediPro Bio-Individualized Roadmap, which factor must be addressed first before initiating intensive antimicrobial 'Remove' protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Microbiome alpha-diversity scores",
                "Genetic SNPs related to vitamin D metabolism",

                "The reintroduction of high-FODMAP legumes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Before 'Removing' pathogens, a practitioner must ensure the client's 'drainage' (bowel movements, liver support, hydration) is optimal to prevent the accumulation of metabolic waste and endotoxins."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the 5R Framework 2.0, the 'Replace' phase specifically targets the restoration of which physiological components?",
            "options": [
                "Digestive secretions like HCL, bile salts, and pancreatic enzymes",
                "Commensal bacteria like Akkermansia muciniphila only",
                "The intestinal mucosal lining using L-Glutamine",
                "Systemic inflammatory cytokines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Replace' phase focuses on replacing essential digestive components (acid, enzymes, bile) that may be deficient, ensuring proper breakdown of food before proceeding to later stages."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When utilizing 'Dietary Stacking,' what is the primary reason for the 'Micro-Challenge' approach during the transition from a therapeutic diet to maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client remains in ketosis",
                "To identify specific food triggers while maintaining overall nutrient density",

                "To maximize weight loss during the gut healing process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-challenges (introducing one food every 3-4 days) allow the practitioner and client to isolate specific triggers without causing a total systemic flare, facilitating a broader, more resilient diet."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "Which prebiotic fiber is highlighted in 'Precision Microbiome Modulation' for its ability to increase Bifidobacteria with a low risk of gas production (low fermentability rate)?",

                "High-dose Apple Pectin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PHGG is clinically preferred in sensitive gut protocols (like SIBO or IBS) because its slow fermentation rate selectively feeds beneficial bacteria without the rapid gas expansion seen with Inulin or FOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client presents with increased fatigue, skin breakouts, and 'brain fog' 72 hours after starting a high-dose oregano oil protocol. This is likely a Herxheimer response caused by:",
            "options": [

                "The release of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from dying Gram-negative bacteria",

                "Excessive levels of Bifidobacterium in the colon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Herxheimer (die-off) response occurs when the rapid killing of pathogens releases endotoxins like LPS into the bloodstream, temporarily overwhelming the body's detoxification capacity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "Based on Circadian Biology, why is a 12-14 hour overnight fast critical for preventing SIBO relapse?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) to clear the small intestine of debris",
                "It increases the production of cortisol to wake the client up",
                "It prevents the fermentation of proteins in the stomach",
                "It reduces the diversity of the oral microbiome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MMC acts as a 'cleansing wave' in the small intestine, occurring only during fasting states. Disrupting this with late-night snacking leads to bacterial stasis and potential SIBO recurrence."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "When a client reaches a 'Plateau' (symptoms stop improving but do not worsen), what is the first 'Pivoting' strategy recommended?",

                "Double the dosage of all current supplements immediately",
                "Switch to a more restrictive diet like the GAPS diet",
                "Assess non-dietary 'hidden' variables like sleep quality and blue light exposure",
                "Stop all interventions and return to a standard diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Plateaus are often caused by lifestyle factors (circadian disruption, chronic stress) that prevent the nervous system from entering the 'rest and digest' state necessary for final healing."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In the 'Maintenance and Resilience' phase, what is the target 'Alpha-Diversity' goal for long-term health?",
            "options": [
                "A low diversity score to prevent overgrowth",
                "A high diversity score, indicating a wide range of microbial species",
                "A score of zero for all Proteobacteria",
                "Diversity is irrelevant as long as the client takes a daily probiotic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High alpha-diversity (the variety of species within a sample) is a primary marker of gut resilience, associated with better metabolic health and reduced risk of chronic disease."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Saccharomyces boulardii is a beneficial yeast clinically shown to increase sIgA levels, strengthening the gut's primary immune defense line."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Statistics show that approximately what percentage of patients experience a 'Herxheimer Response' during intensive gut protocols, requiring a 'Low and Slow' dosing approach?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Around 15-30%",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While not every client experiences die-off, approximately 15-30% do, making it a critical management point for practitioners to avoid protocol abandonment."
