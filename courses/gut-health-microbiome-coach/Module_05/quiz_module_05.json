            "question": "Which phase of the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is known as the 'housekeeper wave' and is responsible for clearing the small intestine of undigested food and bacteria?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I: The period of quiescence",
                "Phase II: The period of irregular contractions",
                "Phase III: The period of high-amplitude rhythmic contractions",
                "Phase IV: The transition phase back to quiescence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III is the most critical phase for SIBO prevention, characterized by strong, propagating contractions that occur every 90–120 minutes during a fasting state to sweep the lumen."

            "question": "According to the North American Consensus (2017) for breath testing, what is the diagnostic threshold for Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO)?",
            "options": [
                "A rise in methane of ≥20 ppm within 90 minutes",
                "A methane concentration of ≥10 ppm at any point during the test",
                "A methane concentration of ≥3 ppm at any point during the test",
                "A combined rise of hydrogen and methane of ≥15 ppm within 120 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike hydrogen, which requires a specific rise from baseline, methane is considered positive for IMO if the level is ≥10 ppm at any point during the 120-180 minute test."

            "question": "In the landmark 2014 study by Chedid et al., how did herbal antimicrobial therapy (using FC Cidal and Dysbiocide) compare to Rifaximin for the treatment of SIBO?",
            "options": [
                "Herbal therapy was significantly less effective than Rifaximin (22% vs 34%)",
                "Herbal therapy showed equivalent efficacy to Rifaximin (34% vs 34%)",
                "Herbal therapy showed a higher response rate than Rifaximin (46% vs 34%)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study (n=104) found that 46% of patients receiving herbal therapy had a negative follow-up breath test compared to 34% of those receiving Rifaximin."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'rotten egg' smelling gas and a 'flatline' result on a standard 2-gas (H2/CH4) breath test despite severe symptoms. Which condition should be suspected?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria compete for hydrogen. A flatline on H2/CH4 tests combined with sulfur-smelling gas is a clinical hallmark of H2S SIBO, now detectable via the Trio-Smart test."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cytolethal Distending Toxin B (CdtB) is produced by food-poisoning bacteria; the body's immune response can cross-react with vinculin, a protein essential for the function of the MMC's pacemaker cells."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "The Elemental Diet is often used for refractory SIBO cases. According to research by Pimentel et al., what is the success rate for normalizing a breath test after 14 days of an elemental diet?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pimentel's study showed an 80% success rate at 14 days, which increased to 85% if the diet was extended to 21 days."

                "Methane-producing archaea directly synthesize histamine from bile salts",
                "Low FODMAP diets are naturally high in histamine, causing a cumulative load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DAO enzyme is produced in the tips of the villi in the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth causes microvilli damage, leading to impaired histamine degradation."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When managing a client with Methane-dominant SIBO (IMO), which pharmaceutical combination is most supported by clinical evidence?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show Rifaximin alone has a low success rate for IMO (~30%), but combining it with Neomycin or Metronidazole increases the eradication rate to approximately 85%."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical reason for using a prokinetic agent like Prucalopride or Low-Dose Erythromycin in a SIBO protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To kill remaining bacteria in the large intestine",
                "To increase stomach acid production (HCL)",
                "To prevent relapse by stimulating the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prokinetics are used after the antimicrobial phase to support the MMC and prevent the stagnation that allows bacteria to re-colonize the small intestine."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Bi-Phasic Diet Phase 1 is highly restrictive, excluding all grains (like rice/quinoa) and high-FODMAP legumes (like lentils) and aromatics (garlic) to rapidly starve the overgrowth."
