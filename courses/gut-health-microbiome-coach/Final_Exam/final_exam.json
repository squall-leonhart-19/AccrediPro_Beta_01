            "question": "A client presents with chronic bloating and constipation. Breath testing reveals a peak of 15 ppm hydrogen and 18 ppm methane at the 90-minute mark. According to the North American Consensus, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Negative for SIBO as hydrogen is below 20 ppm.",
                "Positive for Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) because methane is ≥ 10 ppm.",
                "Positive for Hydrogen-dominant SIBO only.",
                "Inconclusive; requires a glucose breath test for confirmation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The North American Consensus (2017) defines Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO) as a methane concentration of ≥ 10 ppm at any point during the test. Unlike hydrogen-dominant SIBO, methane can be elevated throughout the small and large intestine, and is strongly correlated with constipation-predominant symptoms."

            "question": "Which specific mechanism describes how the 'Estrobolome' influences systemic estrogen levels?",
            "options": [
                "Microbes produce estrogen de novo from dietary fiber.",
                "Microbial beta-glucuronidase deconjugates estrogen, allowing reabsorption into circulation.",
                "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) directly stimulate the ovaries to produce estradiol.",
                "Bifidobacteria neutralize excess estrogen in the liver via the first-pass effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is the aggregate of enteric bacterial genes whose products are capable of metabolizing estrogens. Bacteria producing beta-glucuronidase deconjugate bound estrogen (estrogen glucuronides) in the gut, allowing the free hormone to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream via enterohepatic circulation, potentially leading to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Gut-Brain Axis, which 'psychobiotic' strain has been most notably associated with reducing cortisol levels and modulating GABA receptors via the vagus nerve in preclinical models?",
            "options": [
                "Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1)",
                "Enterococcus faecium",
                "Bacillus subtilis",
                "Streptococcus thermophilus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) has been extensively studied for its ability to communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve. Research (Bravo et al., 2011) demonstrated that it can alter GABA receptor expression in the brain and reduce corticosterone levels, highlighting its role as a potent psychobiotic."

            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "When assessing a GI-MAP (DNA Stool Analysis), a high level of Secretory IgA (sIgA) most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Immune exhaustion and increased susceptibility to infection.",
                "An active immune response to a pathogen, allergen, or yeast overgrowth.",
                "A healthy, robust mucosal barrier with no clinical significance.",
                "Low levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA is the primary immunoglobulin of the mucosal immune system. Elevated levels indicate that the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is actively responding to an 'insult,' such as a parasite, pathogenic bacteria, food sensitivity, or fungal overgrowth."

            "question": "A 45-year-old client with Type 2 Diabetes shows a significant depletion in Akkermansia muciniphila. Based on Module 7 (Metabolic Health), what is the primary consequence of this deficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of butyrate in the distal colon.",
                "Reduced mucosal barrier integrity leading to metabolic endotoxemia (LPS translocation).",
                "Excessive production of methane leading to weight gain.",
                "Decreased bile acid sequestration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium that strengthens the gut barrier. Low levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability, allowing Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to enter the bloodstream (metabolic endotoxemia), which triggers systemic inflammation and insulin resistance."

                "Acute viral gastroenteritis unrelated to the protocol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs when the rapid killing of bacteria or yeast releases metabolic byproducts and endotoxins (like LPS) into the system faster than the liver can process them, resulting in temporary 'die-off' symptoms."

        {
            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "Which phase of the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is considered the 'housekeeper wave' responsible for clearing undigested food and bacteria from the small intestine?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I (Quiescence)",
                "Phase II (Irregular contractions)",
                "Phase III (High-amplitude, rhythmic contractions)",
                "Phase IV (Transition to feeding)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III is the most active phase of the MMC, characterized by strong, rhythmic contractions that sweep the small intestine. Deficiencies in Phase III are a primary risk factor for the development of SIBO."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "According to the AccrediPro methodology for 'Complex Client Scenarios' (M17), what is the first step when a client presents with both SIBO and Histamine Intolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive antimicrobial therapy to kill the SIBO immediately.",
                "High-dose probiotic therapy to crowd out pathogens.",

                "Fast-track to liver detoxification protocols."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex cases involving Histamine Intolerance (HIT), the practitioner must first stabilize the client's symptoms and reduce the 'histamine bucket' via diet and mast cell support. Attempting to kill SIBO first often exacerbates HIT symptoms due to die-off and inflammation."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 16S rRNA sequencing and Shotgun Metagenomic sequencing in microbiome testing?",
            "options": [
                "16S is more expensive but provides species-level data.",
                "Shotgun sequencing identifies functional gene potential, while 16S primarily identifies bacterial taxonomy.",
                "16S can detect viruses and fungi, whereas Shotgun cannot.",
                "There is no practical difference for a health coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "16S rRNA sequencing targets a specific gene to identify 'who is there' (taxonomy), usually to the genus level. Shotgun Metagenomics sequences all DNA, providing species/strain level identification and, crucially, the 'functional potential' (what the microbes are doing)."

            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "A client with Psoriasis (Gut-Skin Axis) is found to have high levels of Proteobacteria. Which dietary intervention is most scientifically supported to shift this phylum?",
            "options": [
                "A high-fat, ketogenic diet.",
                "A high-fiber, plant-diverse diet to increase SCFAs and lower colonic pH.",
                "A carnivore diet to starve the bacteria.",
                "A liquid-only elemental diet for 3 weeks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proteobacteria (including E. coli) thrive in inflammatory, high-oxygen environments. Increasing dietary fiber promotes the growth of obligate anaerobes (like Firmicutes) that produce SCFAs, lowering the pH and maintaining hypoxia, which suppresses the overgrowth of facultative anaerobes like Proteobacteria."

                "Explain the mechanism of action of Berberine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Health coaches must operate within their scope of practice. While they can educate on lab markers and suggest nutritional support, they cannot diagnose medical conditions or prescribe treatments for diseases, as this is the practice of medicine."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut microbes convert dietary choline and carnitine into TMA, which the liver oxidizes into TMAO. Elevated TMAO levels are strongly linked to an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by promoting plaque formation in arteries."

                "Providing more scientific papers to prove the protocol works."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a core coaching skill. It helps clients resolve ambivalence and find internal motivation, which is more effective for long-term compliance than external pressure or information dumping."

                "Iodine deficiency causes the gut to leak bacteria into the thyroid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system mounts a response against a foreign antigen (like a gut pathogen) that shares structural similarities with self-antigens (like thyroid peroxidase). This leads to an accidental autoimmune attack on the body's own tissues."
