            "question": "During an 'Amygdala Hijack,' what physiological change occurs that prevents rational decision-making in parenting?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is bypassed as the amygdala triggers a rapid sympathetic nervous system response.",
                "The Hippocampus increases in volume, causing an overload of short-term memory.",
                "The Parasympathetic nervous system takes over, leading to 'freeze' states exclusively.",
                "Oxytocin levels spike, causing emotional over-sensitivity to the child's cries."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An amygdala hijack occurs when the amygdala perceives a threat and bypasses the Prefrontal Cortex (the rational brain), leading to immediate, reactive behaviors (fight, flight, or freeze) before the conscious mind can intervene."

            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Attunement,' what is the primary function of somatic resonance between parent and child?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the child follows verbal instructions more quickly.",
                "To allow the parent to 'feel into' the child's internal state through mirror neuron activation.",
                "To create a cognitive map of the child's future academic success.",
                "To prevent the child from experiencing any negative emotions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic resonance involves the parent's nervous system mirroring the child's internal state, facilitated by mirror neurons, allowing for deep, non-verbal understanding and emotional regulation."

            "question": "The 'Intentional Architecture' model suggests that values-based decision making is superior to reactive parenting because:",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates the need for any discipline or boundaries.",
                "It focuses on immediate compliance rather than long-term character.",
                "It aligns daily actions with the 'North Star' of the family’s long-term vision and core values.",
                "It relies on the parent's mood to determine the appropriate response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intentional Architecture moves parents away from impulsive, mood-driven reactions and toward intentional actions that reflect their core values and long-term goals for their child's development."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Goodness of Fit' model (Chess & Thomas), behavioral issues in neurodivergent children most often arise when:",
            "options": [
                "The child has an inherent 'difficult' temperament that cannot be managed.",
                "There is a mismatch between the child's capacities and the environmental demands/expectations.",
                "The parent is too empathetic toward the child's sensory needs.",
                "The child is not given enough screen time to regulate their nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Goodness of Fit' model posits that psychological adjustment is not just about the child's traits, but how well the environment and parental expectations accommodate those traits."

            "id": "q9_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SDT (Deci & Ryan) suggests that for healthy development and intrinsic motivation, children need to feel a sense of Autonomy (choice), Competence (mastery), and Relatedness (connection)."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In 'Generational Alchemy,' how does epigenetics explain the transmission of trauma across generations?",
            "options": [
                "Trauma changes the actual DNA sequence (A, T, C, G) of the parents.",
                "Trauma is only passed down through verbal stories and conscious modeling.",
                "Environmental stressors can add chemical 'tags' (like methyl groups) to DNA, affecting gene expression in offspring.",
                "Epigenetics has been debunked and does not apply to human behavior."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics involves changes in gene expression (turning genes on or off) without changing the DNA sequence itself, often as a result of environmental stressors or trauma."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The R.A.I.S.E. protocol (Regulate, Attune, Identify, Stabilize, Empower) starts with 'Regulate' because a dysregulated parent cannot regulate a dysregulated child."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "When performing a 'Clinical Case Formulation' in Lesson 8, what does the 'Identify' phase of the R.A.I.S.E. protocol focus on?",
            "options": [
                "Identifying which parent is to blame for the conflict.",
                "Identifying the underlying unmet need or sensory trigger driving the behavior.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Identify' phase moves beyond the surface behavior to find the 'root cause,' such as a sensory processing issue, a lack of autonomy, or an unmet need for connection."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis cited in the module regarding neurodiversity suggests that 'Differential Susceptibility' means:",
            "options": [
                "Some children are 'dandelions' who thrive anywhere, while 'orchids' are highly sensitive to both positive and negative environments.",
                "Neurodivergent children are inherently less capable of emotional regulation.",
                "Parents should treat all children exactly the same to ensure fairness.",
                "Medication is the only effective intervention for high-conflict households."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Differential Susceptibility (Belsky) suggests that highly sensitive children (orchids) suffer more in poor environments but actually flourish more than others in highly supportive, conscious environments."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In a high-conflict de-escalation scenario, why is 'Empower' the final step of the R.A.I.S.E. protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Because children should only have power when they are perfectly behaved.",
                "To give the child a sense of agency and collaborative problem-solving after the nervous system is regulated.",
                "To allow the child to decide their own punishment.",
                "Because the parent is usually too tired to continue leading at that point."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Once regulation and stability are achieved, 'Empower' focuses on collaborative problem solving, which builds the child's executive function and sense of agency for the future."
