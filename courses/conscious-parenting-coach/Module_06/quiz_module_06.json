            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Neurobiology of Empowerment' discusses 'effortful control.' Which brain region is primarily responsible for this executive function, allowing a child to inhibit an immediate impulse for a long-term goal?",
            "options": [
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) is the seat of executive function, responsible for effortful control, decision-making, and the inhibition of impulsive behaviors, which are essential for developing autonomy."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Attunement' lesson, which branch of the nervous system must be active for a child to exhibit 'social engagement' behaviors rather than 'fight-or-flight' responses?",
            "options": [
                "Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "Dorsal Vagal Complex",
                "Ventral Vagal Complex",
                "Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on Polyvagal Theory, the Ventral Vagal Complex is associated with the 'Social Engagement System,' allowing for eye contact, facial expression, and the ability to process human speech."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 introduces the 'Architecture of Response-Ability.' What is the primary neurobiological goal of 'Mastering the Pause' during a conflict?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the Sympathetic Nervous System to peak",
                "To facilitate the transition from subcortical reactivity to cortical regulation",
                "To ensure the child feels the weight of the parent's silence",
                "To activate the 'freeze' response for immediate compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pause allows the brain to move from the 'low road' (subcortical/amygdala reactivity) to the 'high road' (cortical/PFC regulation), enabling a response based on values rather than triggers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In the 'Legacy Audit' (Lesson 4), what does the term 'Ghosts in the Nursery' refer to in a clinical coaching context?",
            "options": [
                "Literal fears children have of the dark",
                "The physical absence of a parent during early development",
                "Unresolved intergenerational trauma that subconsciously influences current parenting",
                "The genetic predisposition toward anxiety disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Originally coined by Selma Fraiberg, 'Ghosts in the Nursery' refers to the uninvited visitors from the parent's past—unprocessed trauma or scripts—that impact how they relate to their own child."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "When applying 'Differentiated Support' for neurodiverse children (Lesson 5), what is the primary objective of 'Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "To provide permanent assistance so the child never fails",
                "To remove all obstacles from the child's environment",
                "To provide temporary support within the Zone of Proximal Development to foster eventual independence",
                "To discipline the child until they conform to neurotypical standards"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing the specific level of support a child needs to succeed at a task they cannot yet do alone, gradually removing that support as they gain mastery."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "During Lesson 6 on 'Inner Child Coaching,' which somatic marker is often a sign that a parent has been 'triggered' into a childhood regression?",
            "options": [
                "A sudden deepening of the voice",
                "A shift to shallow, high-chest breathing and a higher vocal pitch",
                "Increased peripheral vision and relaxed jaw muscles",
                "A decrease in heart rate and body temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic markers of regression often include 'younger' physiological states, such as rapid shallow breathing, a higher vocal pitch, or physical shrinking/collapsing of posture."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, research on Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG) suggests that what factor is most critical for a family to move from trauma to growth?",
            "options": [
                "The total absence of further stressors",
                "The presence of a 'Compassionate Witness' or supportive coach to help with meaning-making",
                "Forgetting the traumatic event as quickly as possible",
                "Strict adherence to previous routines without modification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meaning-making and social support are the cornerstones of PTG. Having a coach or witness to help process the event allows the family to rebuild their 'assumptive world' in a stronger way."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Within the RAISE Synthesis (Lesson 8), which step involves 'uncovering the underlying need or belief' behind a behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Recognize",
                "Attune",
                "Inquire",
                "Empower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Inquire' phase is dedicated to curiosity—moving past the surface behavior to understand the unmet need or the limiting belief driving the action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that parents who practiced 'Intentionality Audits' (Lesson 4) showed what specific outcome compared to the control group?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in child compliance scores",
                "A 30% reduction in self-reported parental stress and higher 'Value-Action' alignment",
                "A total elimination of sibling rivalry",
                "No measurable difference in parenting outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intentionality and legacy work significantly reduce parental stress by providing a clear 'North Star,' reducing the friction between a parent's values and their daily actions."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a parent, finds herself screaming when her autistic son, Leo, hums loudly. In Lesson 6, how would a coach help Sarah identify if this is an 'Inner Child' trigger?",
            "options": [
                "By telling Sarah that Leo's humming is a medical symptom she must ignore",
                "By exploring if Sarah was 'shushed' or punished for being loud or expressive in her own childhood",
                "By focusing only on Leo's sensory processing and ignoring Sarah's reaction",
                "By recommending Sarah wear earplugs to avoid the trigger"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inner child coaching explores the 'echo' of the past. If Sarah's reaction is disproportionate to the event (screaming at humming), it often points to a personal wound where her own expression was suppressed."
