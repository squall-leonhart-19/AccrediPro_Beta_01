            "question": "In the synergistic application of the R.A.I.S.E. framework, if a parent notices their own heart rate increasing during the 'Inquiry' phase, what is the mandatory protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Push through to the Empowerment phase to reach a resolution quickly",
                "Immediately pivot back to the 'Regulation' phase to re-establish a Ventral Vagal state",
                "Use a 'Power Over' strategy to maintain control of the conversation",
                "Ignore the physiological response and focus on the child's behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The R.A.I.S.E. framework is non-linear; Regulation is the foundation. If the parent loses their own regulation, they cannot provide the 'biological anchor' needed for the rest of the process."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the Vagus nerve is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System' and must be active for conscious parenting to be effective?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (immobilization)",
                "The Sympathetic Adrenal Medullary axis",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex (safe/social)",
                "The Enteric Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex facilitates the 'Social Engagement System,' allowing for eye contact, prosody of voice, and the ability to connect and co-regulate."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In high-conflict dynamics, the 'Low Demand' approach is often used during escalation. What is the primary neurobiological goal of reducing demands during a crisis?",
            "options": [
                "To let the child 'win' the argument",
                "To decrease the cognitive load on a brain currently dominated by the amygdala",
                "To reward the child for their emotional outburst",
                "To ensure the parent doesn't have to work as hard"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child is in a state of 'amygdala hijack,' their prefrontal cortex is offline. Reducing demands lowers the perceived threat and cognitive load, allowing the nervous system to return to safety."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Damian Milton’s 'Double Empathy Problem' suggests that difficulties in neurodiverse families often stem from:",
            "options": [
                "The neurodivergent individual's lack of empathy",
                "The neurotypical parent's inability to understand the child's sensory needs",
                "A mutual breakdown in communication due to differing lived experiences and processing styles",
                "Genetic mutations that prevent emotional bonding"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem posits that communication issues are a 'two-way street' where both neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals struggle to empathize with the other's vastly different social reality."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Research by Rachel Yehuda on epigenetics suggests that trauma can influence gene expression (such as cortisol sensitivity) across generations. What is the specific mechanism mentioned in the course?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic inheritance involves chemical tags like DNA methylation that change how genes are expressed without altering the underlying DNA sequence."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "A 2023 study on 'Technoference' found that even brief, frequent interruptions by mobile devices during parent-child interactions correlated with:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Technoference disrupts 'serve-and-return' interactions, leading to increased behavioral issues in children and higher feelings of frustration in parents."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "When working with diverse family ecosystems, 'Cultural Humility' differs from 'Cultural Competence' because it emphasizes:",

                "Ignoring cultural differences to treat everyone the same"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural Humility is an ongoing process of self-critique and learning, whereas competence often implies a finished state of 'mastery' over a culture's facts."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In the 'Path to Mastery,' what is the '70/30 Rule' regarding attunement and repair?",
            "options": [
                "Parents must be perfectly attuned 70% of the time to avoid trauma",
                "70% of parenting should be discipline, 30% should be fun",
                "Perfect attunement only happens about 30% of the time; the remaining 70% is the opportunity for repair",
                "30% of families will never achieve the RAISE framework mastery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research by Ed Tronick shows that even the most 'perfect' parents are out of sync 70% of the time. The 'Mastery' lies in the ability to recognize the rupture and move to repair."

            "question": "Which specific modification to the R.A.I.S.E. framework is recommended for a child with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) during the 'Regulation' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the volume of the parent's voice to ensure they are heard",
                "Using 'Sensory Diet' inputs (like weighted blankets or noise-canceling headphones) as primary tools",
                "Forcing eye contact to ensure the child is paying attention",
                "Using long, complex verbal explanations of why they are upset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For children with SPD, regulation is often physiological and sensory-based. Providing the right sensory input is a necessary precursor to any emotional or cognitive work."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fraiberg’s concept describes how parents unconsciously repeat the patterns of their own upbringing, effectively bringing their past 'ghosts' into the room with their child."
