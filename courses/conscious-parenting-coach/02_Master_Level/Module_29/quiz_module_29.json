            "question": "According to the neurobiology of crisis (L1), which branch of the Vagus nerve must be activated to transition a parent from a 'fight-flight' state into a 'social engagement' state?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal complex",
                "The Ventral Vagal complex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal complex is responsible for the 'Social Engagement System,' which allows for calm, connection, and co-regulation during a crisis."

                "The ability to read the child's facial expressions accurately",
                "The cognitive understanding of child development milestones",
                "The internal perception of physiological signals that precede emotional reactivity",
                "The manipulation of the environment to reduce sensory input"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive awareness allows parents to feel their own internal physiological shifts (like heart rate or muscle tension) before they manifest as an emotional outburst."

            "question": "Multi-Generational Legacy Mapping (L3) utilizes the concept of 'Epigenetic Signaling.' What does a 2021 meta-analysis suggest about this phenomenon in parenting?",
            "options": [
                "DNA sequences are permanently altered by single parenting mistakes",
                "Stress-induced changes in gene expression can be passed down but are reversible through consistent co-regulation",
                "Generational trauma has no biological basis and is purely behavioral",
                "Epigenetic markers only affect the first generation of offspring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that while trauma impacts gene expression (epigenetics), the neuroplasticity of the brain and consistent co-regulation can 're-write' these signals over time."

            "question": "When working with neurodivergent profiles (L4), why is 'Bottom-Up' regulation prioritized over 'Top-Down' strategies during dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Because neurodivergent children lack the capacity for logic",
                "Because the prefrontal cortex (logic center) is effectively offline when the sensory system is overwhelmed",
                "Because 'Top-Down' strategies are only for neurotypical children",
                "Because sensory integration is a cognitive-first process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During sensory or emotional overwhelm, the lower brain regions dominate; addressing the body and sensory needs (bottom-up) is required before the child can access the prefrontal cortex (top-down) for reasoning."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antifragility goes beyond resilience; it is the quality of a system that improves and evolves specifically because it encounters and integrates stressors."

                "Ignore it to keep the client comfortable",
                "Point out the behavior aggressively to break the pattern",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Master Coach uses professional presence to hold space for the client's survival strategies (like fawning) and reflects them back somatically to foster integration."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Physiological synchrony (HRV) is a key metric in co-regulation, showing that the coach's calm state can literally pull the client's nervous system into a more regulated state."
