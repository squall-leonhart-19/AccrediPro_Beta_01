            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recognition involves shifting from a behavioral lens to a neurobiological lens, understanding that the child's response is a result of brain wiring rather than defiance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel Parenting allows parents to remain involved in the child's life while minimizing direct contact with each other, thereby reducing the child's exposure to parental conflict."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Research by Dr. Elaine Aron (L3) indicates that the Highly Sensitive Child (HSC) possesses a trait known as Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS). What percentage of the population is estimated to carry this trait?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SPS is found in approximately 15-20% of the population and is characterized by deeper processing of sensory information and higher emotional reactivity."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "What is the primary challenge associated with 'Asynchronous Development' in Twice-Exceptional (2e) learners (L4)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asynchrony in 2e learners means their intellectual, emotional, and physical development do not progress at the same rate, often leading to frustration and 'masking' of disabilities."

            "id": "q27_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Primal Wound refers to the deep-seated attachment trauma caused by the initial separation from the biological mother, which requires long-term conscious attunement to heal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Excessive social media use is linked to heightened sensitivity in the brain's reward centers (ventral striatum), making adolescents more susceptible to social validation and feedback loops."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The parent acts as a biological buffer; by maintaining their own regulated state, they help the child stay within their 'Window of Tolerance' during medical trauma."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the initial bonding phase, the 'Friend/Mentor' role is more effective for stepparents. Direct discipline by a stepparent before a solid bond is formed often leads to resentment and conflict."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ADHD brain is wired to prioritize interest, novelty, and urgency over the 'importance' or 'rewards' that motivate neurotypical brains."

                "Underactive amygdala response",
                "Hyper-responsivity of the mirror neuron system",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
