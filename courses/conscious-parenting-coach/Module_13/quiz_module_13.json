            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "According to the science of mirror neurons discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary mechanism that allows a parent to 'feel' their child's internal state?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Appraisal",
                "Embodied Simulation",
                "Sympathetic Resonance",
                "Logical Deduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mirror neurons facilitate 'Embodied Simulation,' where the parent's brain mimics the neural patterns of the child's actions or emotions, allowing for direct experiential understanding."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the nervous system must be active for a child to feel safe enough for social engagement and learning?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex",
                "The Ventral Vagal Complex",
                "The HPA Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex (the 'Social Engagement System') is responsible for the state of safety and connection required for attunement."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Research by Ed Tronick on the 'Rupture and Repair' cycle indicates that 'good enough' parents are typically in a state of perfect attunement what percentage of the time?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-33%",
                "Approximately 50-60%",
                "Approximately 90-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tronick's research demonstrates that even the most attuned parents are only 'in sync' about 33% of the time; the key to resilience is the frequency and quality of the repair, not the absence of rupture."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Chronic stress and high levels of cortisol in a parent primarily inhibit which area of the brain, making attunement difficult?",
            "options": [

                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High cortisol levels 'off-line' the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), which is responsible for executive function, empathy, and emotional regulation, leading to reactive rather than attuned parenting."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In the context of neurodiversity (Lesson 6), how does an 'Orchid' child differ from a 'Dandelion' child in their response to the environment?",
            "options": [
                "Orchids are resilient regardless of the environment.",
                "Orchids show high sensitivity and suffer more in poor environments but thrive exceptionally in supportive ones.",
                "Dandelions are more sensitive to subtle changes in parental attunement.",
                "Orchids have a lower threshold for sensory input but higher emotional regulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Orchid' child exhibits differential susceptibility; they are more vulnerable to negative environments but have the capacity to flourish more than 'Dandelions' when provided with high-quality, attuned care."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Somatic attunement involves monitoring 'prosody.' What does this term refer to in a coaching or parenting context?",
            "options": [
                "The physical distance between parent and child.",
                "The rhythm, pitch, and intonation of the voice.",
                "The specific words used during a conflict.",
                "The micro-expressions of the lower face."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prosody refers to the non-verbal elements of speech like tone and rhythm, which communicate safety or threat to the child's nervous system via the Ventral Vagal pathway."
        },

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client realizes they 'checked out' emotionally during their child's tantrum. According to the R.A.I.S.E. framework, which step focuses on the parent recognizing their own internal physiological shifts?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Somatic Awareness (the 'S' in R.A.I.S.E.) specifically focuses on the practitioner or parent noticing their own bodily sensations and nervous system state."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Mindfulness practice has been shown to increase neural plasticity in the 'middle prefrontal' areas. What is one of the 9 functions of this area as defined by Dan Siegel?",

                "Rapid Motor Response",
                "Response Flexibility",

                "Long-term Memory Storage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Response flexibility—the ability to pause before reacting—is a core function of the prefrontal cortex enhanced by mindfulness and essential for attunement."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Technoference refers to the interruptions in interpersonal social interactions caused by digital devices, which mimics the 'Still Face' effect and triggers stress responses in children."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A successful 'Repair' after a parenting rupture is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The parent explaining why the child was wrong.",
                "A return to physiological regulation and a sense of emotional safety for both parties.",
                "The child promising not to repeat the behavior.",
                "The parent ignoring the incident to move on quickly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A true neurobiological repair requires the restoration of the Ventral Vagal state (safety) and a reconnection that acknowledges the rupture, fostering resilience."
