            "question": "According to the Polyvagal Theory discussed in Lesson 1, which branch of the nervous system must be active for effective co-regulation to occur between parent and child?",
            "options": [
                "The Dorsal Vagal Complex (immobilization)",
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System (fight/flight)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is the 'social engagement system' that allows for physiological safety, making it the biological foundation for co-regulation."

            "question": "In the context of breaking generational trauma loops (Lesson 2), what does the term 'Epigenetic Plasticity' imply for conscious parenting practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "DNA sequences are permanently altered by trauma and cannot be bypassed.",
                "Environmental interventions and conscious parenting can influence gene expression, potentially 'silencing' trauma markers.",
                "Trauma is only passed down through behavioral modeling, not biological markers.",
                "Generational loops can only be broken through pharmaceutical intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic plasticity suggests that while trauma markers exist, the environment and behaviors (like conscious parenting) can influence how those genes are expressed."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 introduces the 'Double Empathy Problem' (Milton, 2012). How does this concept change the approach to neurodivergent support?",
            "options": [
                "It suggests neurodivergent individuals lack empathy entirely.",
                "It posits that communication breakdowns are a two-way mismatch of social realities, rather than a deficit in the neurodivergent person.",
                "It proves that neurotypical parents cannot raise neurodivergent children effectively.",
                "It focuses exclusively on teaching the child to mask their symptoms to fit in."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem shifts the focus from 'fixing' the child to understanding that both parties have different, but equally valid, ways of processing social cues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Technoference disrupts the 'serve-and-return' interactions necessary for brain development, often leading to increased behavioral issues."

            "options": [
                "To ensure the child is ready to admit their fault.",
                "To move the parent from a 'red zone' (dysregulated) to a 'green zone' (regulated) to prevent re-triggering.",

                "To document the conflict for later coaching sessions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A repair attempted while the parent is still in a sympathetic state (red zone) is likely to fail; the physiological reset ensures the parent can offer genuine safety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attunement in blended families requires recognizing the complex emotions of loyalty binds that children often experience during integration."

                "It allows the coach to parent the child directly.",
                "The coach's ability to regulate the parent provides a blueprint for the parent to regulate the child.",
                "It involves coaching both parents in separate rooms simultaneously.",
                "It refers to the coach using the same curriculum for every client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parallel Process means the coach-client relationship mirrors the parent-child relationship; the coach models the 'Ventral Vagal' presence the parent needs to adopt."
