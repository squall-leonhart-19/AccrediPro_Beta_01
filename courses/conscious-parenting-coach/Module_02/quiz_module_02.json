            "question": "Which neural mechanism is primarily responsible for the 'biological resonance' where a parent subconsciously simulates the emotional state of their child?",
            "options": [
                "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mirror Neuron System (MNS) allows individuals to 'mirror' the actions and emotions of others, forming the neurobiological basis for empathy and attunement."

            "question": "According to Albert Mehrabian’s research on non-verbal presence, what percentage of emotional communication is conveyed through non-verbal cues (body language and tone) rather than the literal words spoken?",
            "options": [
                "7%",
                "38%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mehrabian’s 7-38-55 rule suggests that 93% of emotional meaning is communicated non-verbally (55% body language, 38% tone of voice)."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "The 'Name it to Tame it' technique (Emotional Granularity) is effective because labeling an emotion triggers which neurological shift?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Amygdala activation to process the fear faster.",
                "It activates the Prefrontal Cortex, which sends inhibitory signals to the Amygdala.",
                "It shuts down the Hippocampus to prevent memory formation of the stressor.",
                "It triggers an immediate release of Cortisol to handle the threat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Labeling an emotion engages the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), which helps down-regulate the Amygdala's fight-or-flight response, reducing emotional intensity."

            "options": [
                "100%—perfection is the goal for secure attachment.",
                "Around 30%—the frequency of repair is more important than the frequency of rupture.",
                "Exactly 50%—a balanced state of connection and disconnection.",
                "Over 90%—anything less results in disorganized attachment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tronick's research showed that even the most attuned parents are only 'in sync' about 30% of the time. The strength of the relationship lies in the ability to repair the ruptures."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Iceberg Model posits that behavior is a symptom of underlying needs or physiological states, such as a lack of safety or sensory overwhelm."

                "To correct the parent's grammar and vocabulary.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective loops validate the client's experience and ensure the practitioner is accurately attuned to the client's reality before moving forward."

            "options": [
                "To memorize the client's intake form perfectly.",
                "To achieve a state of 'Neutral Presence' to avoid projecting personal biases onto the client.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-attunement allows the practitioner to regulate their own nervous system, ensuring they provide a 'clean' container for the client without projecting their own stressors or biases."

            "question": "During a coaching session, Sarah (the client) becomes visibly agitated while discussing her child's defiance. If the coach uses 'Vagal Brake' principles for co-regulation, what should the coach do first?",

                "Immediately tell Sarah to 'calm down' for the sake of the session.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation begins with the practitioner's self-regulation. By maintaining a grounded state, the coach’s nervous system can help 'pull' the client back into their window of tolerance."
