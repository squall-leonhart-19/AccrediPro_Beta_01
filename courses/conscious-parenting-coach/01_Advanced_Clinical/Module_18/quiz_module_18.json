            "question": "In the R.A.I.S.E. Ecosystem framework, which component is specifically responsible for ensuring the parent's internal state remains 'regulated' before engaging in discipline?",
            "options": [
                "Relational Attunement",
                "Affective Regulation",

                "Evolving Environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Affective Regulation (the 'A' in R.A.I.S.E.) focuses on the parent's ability to manage their own physiological and emotional arousal, which is a prerequisite for conscious discipline."

            "question": "According to the Polyvagal Parent model, what physiological state must a parent inhabit to facilitate 'Limbic Resonance' and co-regulation with a distressed child?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal state is the 'safe and social' system. It allows for the facial expressions, vocal prosody, and heart rate variability necessary to signal safety to the child's nervous system."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis on somatic integration in parenting found that parents who practiced 'Body-to-Brain' (bottom-up) regulation reduced their reactive outbursts by what average percentage?",
            "options": [
                "15%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that somatic awareness and bottom-up regulation techniques lead to a significant (approx. 42%) reduction in reactive parenting by bypassing the cognitive 'override' that often fails under high stress."

                "Goals are the 'why,' while Intentionality is the 'how.'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic Intentionality involves living out core values regardless of the immediate outcome, whereas goals are fixed endpoints that can lead to frustration if not achieved."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rescuing involves 'stealing the struggle' from the child, which prevents the development of resilience and self-efficacy, whereas scaffolding supports the child through the struggle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Projective Identification (or Shadow Projection) occurs when a parent unconsciously attributes their own suppressed traits or 'disowned selves' onto their child."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis in case conceptualization involves looking at the 'whole picture'—how the parent's nervous system, history, and the family's current dynamics interact to create the presenting problem."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reparenting begins with self-inquiry to identify the origin of the trigger, often tracing back to a specific developmental age where the parent's own needs were unmet or punished."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Conscious parenting isn't about the absence of conflict; it's about the speed and quality of repair. A shortened refractory period indicates high levels of integration and relational safety."
