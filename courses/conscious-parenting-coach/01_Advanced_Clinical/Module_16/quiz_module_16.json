            "question": "In the case study of 'Leo' regarding high-intensity behavioral dysregulation (L1), what is the primary goal of the 'Regulate' phase when the child is in a state of hyper-arousal?",
            "options": [
                "Implementing immediate logical consequences for the behavior",
                "Expanding the child's Window of Tolerance through co-regulation",
                "Explaining why the behavior was socially unacceptable",
                "Encouraging the child to use verbal 'I feel' statements immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-intensity situations, the priority is co-regulation to bring the child back into their Window of Tolerance. Cognitive processing and consequences cannot occur while the nervous system is in a state of fight-or-flight."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Attachment Repair, which element of the PACE model (Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity, Empathy) is specifically designed to reduce 'shame' in foster or adoptive children?",
            "options": [
                "Playfulness",
                "Acceptance",
                "Curiosity",
                "Empathy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acceptance communicates to the child that their internal experience is valid, which is the direct antidote to the toxic shame often found in children with attachment trauma."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the case of 'High-Conflict Co-Parenting' (L3), what is the recommended approach when the other parent refuses to adopt conscious parenting values?",
            "options": [
                "Contradicting the other parent's rules to show the child a better way",
                "Continuous litigation to force the other parent into compliance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When values alignment is impossible, parallel parenting reduces conflict, and the conscious parent focuses on their own home (the Sanctuary Household) as a place of emotional safety."

            "id": "q16_4",

            "options": [
                "Increasing the intensity of rewards for compliance",

                "Removing all boundaries to prevent sensory overload",
                "Focusing exclusively on social skills training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For neurodivergent children, the Support pillar emphasizes modifying the environment and expectations to fit the child's neurological profile rather than forcing compliance through behavioral pressure."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the 'Adolescent Autonomy' case study (L5), the parent's role transition is described as moving from a 'Manager' to which of the following?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As adolescents seek autonomy, the parent must shift into a 'Consultant' role—offering guidance and support while allowing the teen to take the lead on decision-making."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Generational Trauma), 'Elena' discovered her disproportionate anger toward her child's mess was a 'ghost in the nursery.' What does this term signify?",

                "A child's imaginary friend that causes behavioral issues",
                "Unresolved trauma from the parent's own childhood surfacing in parenting",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic burnout often manifests as emotional detachment, where the parent begins to see the child as a burden or an object rather than a person, as a maladaptive defense against stress."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When synthesizing the RAISE framework for long-term transformation (L8), if a parent 'Attunes' but still cannot 'Identify' the root cause, what is the likely missing step?",
            "options": [
                "The parent has not reached a sufficient state of self-regulation",
                "The child is being intentionally manipulative",
                "The parent needs to skip to the 'Empower' phase",
                "The 'Support' pillar has been over-utilized"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Accurate identification of a child's needs (Identify) requires the parent to be fully regulated (Regulate) and present (Attune). If identification fails, it is usually because the parent's own nervous system is still too activated."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Attachment Repair' (L2), why is 'Testing Behavior' common in the middle stages of the intervention?",
            "options": [
                "The child is regressing and the intervention is failing",
                "The child is checking to see if the parent's new 'conscious' approach is authentic and stable",
                "The child has become bored with the PACE model",
                "The child is experiencing a neurodivergent 'meltdown' unrelated to attachment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with attachment trauma often 'test' the new boundaries and safety to see if the parent will remain consistent or revert to old patterns of rejection or anger."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Which statistic from Lesson 4 highlights the importance of the 'Support' pillar for neurodivergent populations?",
            "options": [
                "90% of neurodivergent children prefer visual schedules",
                "Neurodivergent children receive an average of 20,000 more negative corrections by age 10",
                "Adolescents with ADHD are 50% more likely to seek autonomy early",
                "1 in 5 parents of neurodivergent children experience burnout daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The statistic regarding 20,000 more negative corrections highlights the significant 'shame load' neurodivergent children carry and why the Support pillar must focus on reducing criticism."
