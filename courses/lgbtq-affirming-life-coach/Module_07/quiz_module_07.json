            "question": "In the context of the 'Affirming Framework,' why is professional neutrality often considered insufficient when working with LGBTQ+ clients?",
            "options": [
                "Neutrality is perceived as supportive by all client demographics.",
                "In a heteronormative society, neutrality often functions as a passive endorsement of the status quo, failing to counteract internalized shame.",
                "Neutrality is the gold standard for clinical ethics and should never be abandoned.",
                "Affirmation is only necessary when a client specifically asks for it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because LGBTQ+ individuals exist within a heteronormative and often hostile society, a 'neutral' stance by a coach can be interpreted as a lack of safety or an endorsement of societal biases. Affirmation actively counteracts internalized stigma."

            "question": "According to Ilan Meyer's Minority Stress Theory (2003), which of the following is an example of a 'proximal' stressor?",
            "options": [
                "Experiencing a hate crime or physical assault.",
                "Being denied a promotion due to sexual orientation.",
                "Internalized homophobia and the expectation of rejection.",
                "Legal discrimination regarding marriage or adoption rights."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proximal stressors are internal psychological processes, such as internalized stigma or the hyper-vigilance involved in expecting rejection. Distal stressors are external events like discrimination or violence."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When applying Kimberlé Crenshaw’s theory of Intersectionality to coaching, what must a practitioner prioritize?",
            "options": [
                "Treating each identity (race, gender, class) as a separate, isolated silo.",
                "Focusing only on the identity that seems most 'relevant' to the current session.",
                "Recognizing how overlapping identities create unique, non-additive experiences of both oppression and resilience.",
                "Encouraging the client to ignore their secondary identities to focus on their queer identity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality posits that identities do not exist independently; rather, they intersect to create unique experiences. For example, the experience of a Black trans woman is not just 'racism plus transphobia' but a distinct, synthesized experience."

            "question": "What is the primary difference between Gender Dysphoria and Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) as discussed in Lesson 7?",
            "options": [
                "BDD is only found in cisgender individuals.",
                "Gender Dysphoria relates to the incongruence between gender identity and sex characteristics, while BDD involves a preoccupation with perceived flaws in physical appearance.",
                "Gender Dysphoria is a subset of BDD and should be treated with the same exposure therapy techniques.",
                "There is no difference; both are treated through medical transition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gender Dysphoria centers on the mismatch between internal identity and biological sex characteristics. BDD involves obsessive focus on specific 'defects' in appearance that are often unnoticeable to others; affirming surgery treats dysphoria but may not resolve BDD."

            "question": "In Lesson 5, 'Chosen Family' is defined as a critical social system for LGBTQ+ individuals. What does research suggest about these networks?",
            "options": [
                "They are less stable than biological families and provide less emotional support.",
                "They often serve as a protective buffer against the psychological impact of biological family rejection.",
                "They are only necessary for younger clients who have been displaced.",
                "They typically discourage clients from seeking professional coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chosen families provide essential emotional, financial, and social support that mimics or exceeds the role of biological families, particularly when the biological family is unsupportive."

            "options": [
                "Encouraging the client to 'act more professional' to avoid conflict.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An affirming coach helps the client distinguish between external prejudice (distal) and their internal reaction (proximal), providing tools to manage the psychological toll while validating the reality of the discrimination."

                "They are used to prove the client doesn't actually need coaching.",
                "They are internal and external resources (like community or self-efficacy) that mitigate the effects of minority stress.",
                "They are obstacles that prevent the client from reaching their goals.",
                "They are only relevant for clients who have undergone medical transition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resilience factors are the strengths and resources—such as community connection, self-advocacy, and pride—that help LGBTQ+ individuals thrive despite societal challenges."
