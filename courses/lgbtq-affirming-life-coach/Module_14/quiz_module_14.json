            "question": "According to Kimberlé Crenshaw’s framework of intersectionality, why is the 'additive' approach to identity (e.g., Race + Gender + Sexuality) considered insufficient for coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It ignores the fact that marginalized identities overlap to create unique, synergistic systems of discrimination.",
                "It prioritizes sexual orientation over other identities in an LGBTQ+ context.",
                "It is too complex for most clients to understand during a coaching session.",
                "It focuses too heavily on systemic issues rather than individual mindset."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality is not just about adding identities together; it is about how these identities intersect to create unique experiences of oppression and privilege that cannot be understood by looking at each identity in isolation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows LGBTQ+ elders are twice as likely to live alone and significantly less likely to have children to support them, increasing the risk of social isolation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
