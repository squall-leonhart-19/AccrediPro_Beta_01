            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proximal stressors are internal psychological processes, such as internalized homophobia or the hyper-vigilant expectation of being rejected, whereas distal stressors are external objective events like discrimination or violence."

            "question": "In the Cass Model of Identity Development, which stage is characterized by the client integrating their LGBTQ identity as just one part of their total self, rather than the primary defining feature?",

                "Identity Pride",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identity Synthesis is the final stage of the Cass Model where the 'us vs. them' mentality of the Pride stage softens, and the individual integrates their identity into all aspects of their life."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intersectionality, as defined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, suggests that overlapping identities (e.g., being Black and Transgender) create unique experiences of discrimination that cannot be understood by simply adding the two identities together."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress (Allostatic Load) leads to prolonged cortisol exposure, which can impair the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for executive function, decision-making, and future-oriented goal setting."

            "id": "q2_5",

                "Because of the 'Assumption of Heterosexuality' in most social interactions",
                "Because identity is always changing and never stable",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because society generally assumes individuals are cisgender and heterosexual, LGBTQ people must repeatedly decide whether to disclose their identity in new environments (work, healthcare, new friendships) throughout their lives."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gender Euphoria focuses on the positive aspects of gender alignment—the joy, comfort, and 'rightness' a person feels when their gender expression matches their identity—rather than just focusing on the distress (dysphoria)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Since hyper-vigilance is a biological state of high arousal (HPA axis activation), somatic grounding helps the client regulate their nervous system, allowing them to move out of a 'survival' state and back into 'thriving' or goal-oriented thinking."
