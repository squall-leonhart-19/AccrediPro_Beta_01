            "options": [
                "Twice the rate of the general population",
                "Four times the rate of the general population (approx. 26%)",

                "Ten times the rate of the general population"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data from the U.S. Transgender Survey and subsequent analyses indicate that BIPOC trans individuals, particularly Black trans women, face systemic barriers resulting in an unemployment rate of approximately 26%, which is quadruple the national average."

            "question": "In the context of family estrangement (Lesson 2), what is the primary difference between 'Ambiguous Loss' and 'Disenfranchised Grief' for an LGBTQ+ client?",
            "options": [
                "Ambiguous loss refers to a lack of physical presence with psychological presence; disenfranchised grief is grief not socially validated.",
                "Ambiguous loss only applies to death; disenfranchised grief only applies to divorce.",
                "They are clinical synonyms with no functional difference in coaching.",
                "Ambiguous loss is felt by the family; disenfranchised grief is felt only by the client."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ambiguous loss occurs when a family member is physically absent but psychologically present (or vice versa), while disenfranchised grief is mourning that is not recognized or supported by social norms, often seen in LGBTQ+ estrangement."

            "question": "A 2020 study by Warrier et al. (n=641,860) discussed in Lesson 3 found that gender-diverse individuals are how much more likely to be autistic than cisgender individuals?",

                "1.5 times more likely",
                "3 to 6 times more likely",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that transgender and gender-diverse individuals were 3 to 6 times more likely to be autistic than cisgender individuals, necessitating neuro-inclusive coaching strategies."

            "question": "When coaching a client on sobriety amidst minority stress (Lesson 4), which component of Meyer's Minority Stress Model describes the internal monitoring of one's identity to avoid harm?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypervigilance, or the constant expectation of rejection, is a proximal stressor where the individual remains in a state of 'high alert,' which significantly depletes cognitive resources and increases the risk of substance use as a coping mechanism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaching late-in-life transitions requires holding space for the 'split-focus' grief—the dialectical tension between the joy of authentic self-discovery and the pain of dissolving a long-term heteronormative structure."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Boiling Frog Syndrome' refers to the slow, incremental exposure to toxic religious environments where the individual doesn't realize the harm being done until they reach a breaking point or leave the environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity tax is the invisible labor performed by marginalized professionals, such as correcting pronouns, serving on DEI committees without pay, and managing the 'fragility' of cisgender colleagues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compersion is often described as the 'opposite of jealousy'—it is the empathetic joy a person feels for their partner's other relationships, a key concept in ethical non-monogamy."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Your client is a neurodivergent, non-binary person of color struggling with workplace burnout. Which intersectional approach is most appropriate based on the module's case studies?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
