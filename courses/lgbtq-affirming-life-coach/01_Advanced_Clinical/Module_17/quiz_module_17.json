            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kitchen Table Polyamory seeks a communal feel where partners (metamours) are friends, whereas Parallel Polyamory respects boundaries where individual relationships do not overlap socially."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must recognize the signs of crisis and refer out to qualified clinical professionals, as treating suicidal ideation is outside the coaching scope of practice."
