            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "There is no distinction; they are two terms for the same concept."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gender Identity is the internal, deeply held sense of being male, female, both, or neither, while Gender Expression is how a person communicates that identity to others through clothing, hair, and behavior."
