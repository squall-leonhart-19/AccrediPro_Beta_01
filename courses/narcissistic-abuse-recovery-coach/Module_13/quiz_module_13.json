            "options": [
                "The use of separate households with different rules",
                "A deliberate attempt to undermine the other parent's relationship with the child to maintain control",
                "A lack of communication regarding school and medical appointments",
                "Occasional disagreements regarding discipline and extracurricular activities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-parenting is defined by the high-conflict parent's active efforts to obstruct, undermine, and sabotage the other parent's efforts, often viewing the child as a tool for control rather than an individual."

                "Shared decision-making on all minor daily activities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel parenting relies on a rigid, detailed court order that specifies every detail (pick-up times, locations, holidays) to eliminate the 'gray areas' that high-conflict individuals exploit for conflict."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A client receives a 3-page email from their ex-partner full of insults and false accusations about their parenting. Using the BIFF method, how should the coach advise the client to respond?",
            "options": [
                "Respond to every accusation with evidence to prove the ex-partner is lying",
                "Ignore the email entirely, even if it contains a legitimate question about a doctor's appointment",
                "A 2-sentence reply: 'I will be at the pediatrician's office at 4:00 PM on Tuesday as scheduled. Regards.'",
                "A polite response explaining how the insults hurt the client's feelings and asking for mutual respect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BIFF stands for Brief, Informative, Friendly (neutral), and Firm. It ignores the 'hook' (insults) and addresses only the necessary business (the appointment) without emotional engagement."

            "options": [
                "Yellow Rock is more aggressive and confrontational",
                "Yellow Rock adds a layer of 'bland politeness' to appear more cooperative to court evaluators",
                "BIFF is only used for verbal communication, while Yellow Rock is for written",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yellow Rocking is essentially BIFF with a 'customer service' veneer (e.g., using 'Please' and 'Thank you'). This is strategic for court cases where a 'Grey Rock' approach might be misinterpreted as being 'uncooperative' or 'cold' by a judge."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective counter-indoctrination avoids 'badmouthing' the other parent (which can be used against the survivor in court) and instead focuses on building the child's critical thinking and reality-testing skills."

                "Cry and show high emotion to demonstrate how much they have suffered"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evaluators often view high-conflict cases as 'it takes two to tango.' The survivor must present as the stable, child-focused parent by providing objective evidence (emails, logs) rather than clinical labels or emotional outbursts."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by the NNEDV, show that financial abuse occurs in 94-99% of domestic violence cases, often persisting or escalating through legal fees and support withholding after separation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Realistic Estrangement occurs when a child's rejection of a parent is a logical reaction to that parent's actual behavior (abuse or neglect). This is distinct from Parental Alienation, where a child is manipulated into hating a 'good' parent."
