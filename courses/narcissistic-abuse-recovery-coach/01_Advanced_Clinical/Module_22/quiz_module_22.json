            "question": "A client asks you to confirm if their spouse has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) based on a list of behaviors. According to the 'Diagnosis Trap' (L2), what is the most ethical response?",
            "options": [
                "Confirm the diagnosis if the behaviors meet at least 5 of the 9 DSM-5 criteria.",
                "Explain that coaches do not diagnose; instead, focus on the impact of the behaviors on the client.",
                "Tell the client that labeling the abuser is the only way to achieve closure.",
                "Provide a formal written assessment that the client can use in family court."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical recovery coaching avoids clinical diagnosis (L2). Instead of labeling the third party, the coach validates the client's experience of the behaviors and focuses on the client's recovery and safety."

            "options": [
                "The client wants to create a 90-day plan for moving out of their home.",
                "The client is struggling with 'cognitive dissonance' regarding their partner.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation is outside the scope of coaching and requires clinical intervention. L1 emphasizes that coaching is present-to-future focused, while acute pathology or crisis requires therapy or emergency services."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A 2022 study highlighted that approximately 70% of survivors of domestic abuse are targeted via digital surveillance. According to L5, what is a primary ethical duty regarding digital security?",

                "Digital security is the client's sole responsibility and does not fall under coaching ethics."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L5 covers the ethical necessity of protecting client confidentiality in high-conflict scenarios, which includes advising on encrypted communications and recognizing the risks of digital stalking."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to 'freeze' and becomes non-responsive while describing a traumatic event. According to L3 (Trauma-Informed Ethics), what is the coach's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Push the client to finish the story so they can 'process' the trauma.",
                "Interpret the client's silence as resistance to the coaching process.",
                "Utilize grounding techniques to bring the client back to the 'Window of Tolerance'.",
                "Immediately terminate the session and call the police."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 focuses on preventing re-traumatization. If a client is 'flooded' or 'frozen' (outside the Window of Tolerance), the coach must pause and use grounding techniques to ensure safety before proceeding."

            "options": [
                "Empathy is feeling with the client; countertransference is when the coach's own unresolved trauma distorts the coaching relationship.",
                "Countertransference is a professional tool used to mirror the client's pain.",
                "Empathy is only for therapists; coaches must remain entirely detached.",
                "There is no difference; both involve the coach sharing their personal stories to build rapport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L4 defines countertransference as the coach's unconscious emotional reaction to a client, often triggered by the coach's own history. Ethical coaches monitor this to prevent 'enmeshment' or biased guidance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical empowerment (L6) involves restoring the client's agency. The coach facilitates the client's decision-making process rather than becoming another controlling figure in the client's life."

                "Proactively, whenever a client indicates they are in a high-conflict or volatile living situation.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L7 teaches that safety planning is a proactive ethical requirement when working with abuse survivors. It is a collaborative tool used to identify resources and escape routes before a crisis escalates."

            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "Research indicates that up to 50% of practitioners working with trauma survivors experience Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). According to L8, how should a coach ethically manage this risk?",

                "By sharing their stress with their clients to show vulnerability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L8 emphasizes that self-care is an ethical imperative, not a luxury. Professional integrity requires coaches to remain fit for service through supervision and self-regulation to prevent 'Compassion Fatigue'."

            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client's 'Ex-Partner' contacts the coach demanding to know the contents of the sessions, claiming they are paying for the coaching. What is the ethical response (L5)?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality (L5) belongs to the client, regardless of who pays for the service. In high-conflict Narcissistic Abuse cases, protecting the client's privacy is critical for their physical and emotional safety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 explains that pacing is an ethical tool. By monitoring the client's nervous system and allowing them to control the depth of disclosure, the coach avoids 'flooding' the client's system with more cortisol than they can process."
