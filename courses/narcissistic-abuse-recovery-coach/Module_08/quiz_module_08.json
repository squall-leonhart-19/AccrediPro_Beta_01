                "Increased activation of the amygdala during social interactions",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term recovery involves neuroplasticity where the Prefrontal Cortex (the logical brain) regains the ability to inhibit the overactive Amygdala (the fear center), leading to better emotional regulation."

            "options": [
                "An Empowered Boundary is focused on controlling the narcissist's behavior through threats.",
                "An Empowered Boundary is reactive and based on immediate fear of the abuser.",
                "An Empowered Boundary is proactive, rooted in the survivor's core values, and focuses on what the survivor will do to protect their peace.",
                "An Empowered Boundary requires the narcissist to agree to the terms before they are valid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowered boundaries shift the focus from 'stopping them' (defense) to 'protecting me' (empowerment) and are based on internal values rather than external reactions."

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Yellow Rock' method (a more polite version of Grey Rock) minimizes the 'supply' the narcissist receives and prevents the survivor from appearing 'unstable' to observers, which is the goal of the smear campaign."

                "It focuses solely on external muscle building to increase physical strength."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body. Survivors often 'disconnect' from their bodies; reclaiming this sense is vital for rebuilding a sense of self and safety."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pacing allows a survivor to observe how a new person reacts to a 'no' or a slow-down. A safe person respects the pace; a narcissist or toxic individual usually reacts with pressure, guilt, or anger."
