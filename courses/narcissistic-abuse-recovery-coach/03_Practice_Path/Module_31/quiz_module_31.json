            "question": "What is the primary strategic benefit of establishing a 'Micro-Niche' within the Narcissistic Abuse Recovery framework (e.g., focusing specifically on 'Corporate Women Divorcing Narcissists')?",
            "options": [
                "It allows you to charge lower prices to attract more people.",
                "It increases resonance and reduces 'marketing noise' by speaking directly to a specific survivor's unique context.",
                "It prevents you from having to learn about other types of narcissism.",
                "It is a requirement for insurance reimbursement in most states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-niching increases resonance because the copy and solutions feel tailor-made for the client's specific situation, which significantly improves conversion rates and authority."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "In Trauma-Informed Copywriting, why is the traditional 'PAS' (Problem-Agitate-Solution) marketing formula often considered unethical for survivors?",
            "options": [
                "Because it is too short to be effective.",
                "Because 'Agitating' the problem can re-traumatize the survivor and trigger a fight-flight-freeze response.",
                "Because survivors do not respond to solutions.",
                "Because it requires a high level of academic writing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traditional marketing often 'rubs salt in the wound' to drive sales. For survivors with C-PTSD, this can trigger a trauma response, making them feel unsafe and decreasing trust in the coach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Authority in this field is built through the combination of social proof (results), scientific literacy (understanding the neurobiology of trauma), and lived experience (empathy and relatability)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Survivors are often overwhelmed. A 'Quick Win' (like a 1-page checklist) provides immediate value and builds trust without adding to their cognitive load."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed enrollment involves validating the client's reality (financial abuse) while holding space for them to make a decision that prioritizes their safety and long-term recovery."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ad platforms often prohibit 'Personal Attributes' targeting where the copy implies knowledge of the user's personal situation or trauma, as it can feel invasive or predatory."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Exactly 5 touchpoints.",
                "Between 12 and 22 touchpoints, due to hyper-vigilance and the need to establish safety.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because of hyper-vigilance and past betrayal, survivors need significantly more 'proof' and consistency (touchpoints) to feel safe enough to invest in a coach."
