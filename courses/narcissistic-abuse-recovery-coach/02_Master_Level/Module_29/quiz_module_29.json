            "question": "In the context of 'Fluidity in the N.A.R.C. Method™,' why is the 'Linear Progression' model considered insufficient for advanced recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Because clients typically complete all emotional processing in the first three weeks.",
                "Because trauma recovery is non-linear, requiring the coach to pivot between pillars based on the client's immediate nervous system state.",
                "Because the N.A.R.C. Method™ is designed to be a rigid protocol that must be followed alphabetically.",
                "Because linear models are only effective for physical injuries, not psychological trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced integration requires 'Pillar Fluidity,' allowing the coach to move dynamically between Cognitive, Somatic, and Existential pillars as the client's nervous system dictates, rather than following a rigid, step-by-step sequence."

                "Push through the cognitive exercise to challenge the 'resistance.'",
                "Immediately switch to a Top-Down approach to analyze the freeze response.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic-Cognitive Synergy dictates that physiological safety (Bottom-Up) must be established before the prefrontal cortex can effectively engage in cognitive reframing (Top-Down)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Narcissistic Introject is an internal part that mimics the abuser's criticism to 'keep the survivor small,' theoretically protecting them from further external narcissistic rage."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective identification occurs when a client 'deposits' unbearable feelings into the coach, who then begins to feel those emotions as if they were their own."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a 'Protector' part. The coach must acknowledge the somatic sensation (numbing) and work with the part to unblend while maintaining physiological safety."
