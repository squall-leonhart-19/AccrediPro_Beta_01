                "Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is the most primitive survival response, characterized by immobilization, dissociation, and metabolic conservation (the 'freeze' or 'faint' response) often seen in long-term abuse survivors."

            "question": "In the biochemical architecture of a trauma bond, why is 'intermittent reinforcement' more addictive than consistent positive reinforcement?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a steady, predictable flow of serotonin.",
                "The unpredictability triggers massive dopamine spikes and a 'craving' effect.",
                "It lowers cortisol levels, making the victim feel safer.",
                "It prevents the production of oxytocin entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unpredictability in rewards (intermittent reinforcement) creates a powerful dopamine-driven compulsion to seek the 'high' of the abuser's approval, similar to the neurobiology of gambling addiction."
