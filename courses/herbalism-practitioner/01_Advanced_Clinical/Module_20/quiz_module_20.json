            "question": "During the Advanced Clinical Intake (L1), the 'funneling technique' is used to transition from open-ended to closed-ended questions. What is the primary goal of the first 15 minutes of this process?",
            "options": [
                "To establish a definitive pathological diagnosis",
                "To allow the client to narrate their health history without interruption to build rapport and identify core themes",
                "To fill out the 'Review of Systems' checklist as quickly as possible",
                "To prescribe the initial 'hero' herb for the primary complaint"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Expert intake architecture prioritizes active listening in the first 15 minutes to identify the 'narrative thread' and build a therapeutic alliance before narrowing down to specific clinical details."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In Tongue Assessment (L3), a tongue that presents with a red tip and a thin, yellow coating in the center most likely indicates which clinical pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Spleen Qi Deficiency with Dampness",
                "Kidney Yin Deficiency with Empty Heat",

                "Liver Blood Stagnation with Cold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In traditional tongue topography, the tip corresponds to the Heart (emotions/spirit) and the center to the Stomach/Spleen. Redness at the tip indicates heat/stress, while a yellow coat in the center suggests heat in the digestive system."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When interpreting Blood Chemistry through a herbal lens (L5), what is the 'Functional Range' for serum Ferritin for optimal energy and hair growth, as opposed to the standard pathological range?",
            "options": [
                "12 - 150 ng/mL",
                "70 - 100 ng/mL",

                "5 - 20 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While labs may accept 12 ng/mL as 'normal,' functional herbalism recognizes that ferritin levels between 70-100 ng/mL are often required for optimal mitochondrial function and follicular health."

            "question": "In Matthew Wood’s 6 Tissue States (L6), the 'Damp/Stagnation' state is characterized by lymph node swelling and poor metabolic clearance. Which class of herbs is specifically indicated for this state?",
            "options": [
                "Demulcents (e.g., Marshmallow root)",
                "Alteratives and Lymphatics (e.g., Red Clover, Cleavers)",
                "Astringents (e.g., Oak bark)",
                "Pungent Stimulants (e.g., Cayenne)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Damp/Stagnation involves the congestion of fluids and metabolic waste. Alteratives and lymphatics assist the body in moving these fluids and clearing the 'extra-cellular matrix'."

            "id": "q20_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The wiry pulse (Xian Mai) indicates tension in the nervous system or the 'Liver' energetic system, often seen in clients with high stress, PMS, or chronic pain."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During a Constitutional Mapping session (L2), a client presents with an Ectomorphic build, dry skin, thin hair, and a tendency toward anxiety. In the ROOTS protocol, this client would be classified under which energetic tendency?",
            "options": [
                "Hot/Excitation (Pitta)",
                "Cold/Depression (Kapha)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ectomorphs with dry skin and anxiety align with the 'Dry/Atrophy' tissue state or the Vata dosha, requiring nourishing, tonifying, and moistening (demulcent) protocols."

                "Occasional use of organic essential oils"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Halogens like Fluoride and Bromide compete for the same receptors as Iodine. High exposure can lead to functional thyroid issues that herbs alone may not resolve without addressing the exposure."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the ROOTS Protocol synthesis (L8), what does the second 'O' stand for when evaluating a client case?",

            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of spicy foods",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scalloped edges indicate that the tongue is swollen and pressing against the teeth, which is a classic sign of Spleen Qi deficiency and the body's inability to transform fluids efficiently."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When performing a Physical Indicator check (L2), you notice 'Beau's Lines' (horizontal ridges) across all fingernails. This suggests which historical data point for the client?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beau's lines are transverse depressions that appear when nail growth at the matrix is interrupted by a systemic insult such as high fever, infection, or severe nutritional shock."
