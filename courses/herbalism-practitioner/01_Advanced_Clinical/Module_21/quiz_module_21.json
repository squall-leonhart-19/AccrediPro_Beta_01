            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healing crisis is a temporary intensification of symptoms followed by a marked improvement in vitality, whereas an adverse reaction causes a decline in overall well-being and does not resolve without stopping the agent."
