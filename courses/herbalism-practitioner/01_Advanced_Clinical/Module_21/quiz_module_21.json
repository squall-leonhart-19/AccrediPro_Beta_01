            "options": [
                "The Chief Complaint Analysis",
                "The Pathogenetic Timeline",
                "The Constitutional Assessment",
                "The Review of Systems (ROS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pathogenetic Timeline is a specific tool used to map the history of a client's health, helping the practitioner identify the 'First Domino' or the initial insult that led to the current state of dysregulation."

            "question": "According to the Hierarchy of Intervention, if a client presents with severe insomnia (vitality depletion) and chronic PCOS (root hormonal imbalance), which should be addressed in the first 2 weeks?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hierarchy of Intervention dictates that Vitality and Symptom Management (triage) must come before deep Root Cause work. Without sleep/vitality, the body lacks the resources to respond to deeper hormonal protocols."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For highly sensitive or atopic clients, 'Drop Dosing' allows the practitioner to monitor for idiosyncratic reactions or extreme sensitivity before moving to therapeutic ranges."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mild, transient symptoms like headaches or changes in elimination within the first 48-72 hours often indicate a 'clearing response' as the body adjusts to the protocol and begins moving metabolic waste."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that protocol complexity is the leading cause of non-compliance; protocols with more than 3 separate bottles/steps see a significant drop (roughly 45%) in adherence."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-licensed herbalists must avoid 'diagnosing,' 'prescribing,' or 'curing' specific medical diseases. Using medical terminology like 'prescribing' to 'cure' a clinical disease violates most health freedom laws."
