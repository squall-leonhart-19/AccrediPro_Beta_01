            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the context of the HPA-Gut-Immune axis, what percentage of the body's total immune cells are estimated to reside within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": ["Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 70%", "Approximately 90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly 70% of the immune system is located in the gut, making the GALT a primary mediator in multi-system dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "When managing a Th1-dominant autoimmune condition, which botanical is specifically valued for its ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 and IFN-gamma without overstimulating the immune response?",
            "options": ["Echinacea angustifolia", "Scutellaria baicalensis (Baical Skullcap)", "Sambucus nigra", "Panax ginseng"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scutellaria baicalensis contains baicalin, which has been shown to modulate the Th1/Th2 balance and suppress overactive Th1 responses in autoimmune protocols."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis on Metabolic Syndrome compared Berberine to Metformin. What was the specific finding regarding its efficacy on HbA1c levels?",
            "options": ["Berberine was 20% less effective than Metformin", "500mg of Berberine TID was comparable to 850mg of Metformin BID", "Berberine only worked if combined with Insulin", "Metformin was significantly superior in all 42 trials"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that 1.5g of Berberine daily (divided doses) shows comparable efficacy to standard Metformin dosages (1.7g) for blood glucose and HbA1c regulation."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), which biomarker is frequently elevated (>5000 pg/mL) and serves as a primary indicator of TGF-beta1 mediated tissue remodeling?",
            "options": ["C-Reactive Protein (CRP)", "Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 (TGF-b1)", "Hemoglobin A1c", "Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TGF-beta1 is a critical biomarker in CIRS case studies; levels above 5000 pg/mL often indicate significant systemic inflammation and potential for capillary hypoperfusion."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "For a client with PTSD and low Vagal Tone (measured by low HRV), which herb's mechanism of action involves inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing the availability of the 'calming' neurotransmitter acetylcholine?",
            "options": ["Melissa officinalis (Lemon Balm)", "Rhodiola rosea", "Hypericum perforatum", "Arctium lappa"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melissa officinalis acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, supporting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and improving vagal tone in trauma recovery."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In geriatric polypharmacy, which herb is strictly contraindicated for a patient taking Warfarin (Coumadin) due to a clinical risk of increasing the INR by up to 60%?",
            "options": ["Crataegus laevigata (Hawthorn)", "Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen)", "Vaccinium myrtillus (Bilberry)", "Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen) has potent antiplatelet effects and can dangerously potentiate the effects of Warfarin, leading to increased bleeding risk."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "When applying Clark's Rule for pediatric dosing, if the adult dose of a tincture is 5mL, what would be the dose for a child weighing 30 lbs?",
            "options": ["0.5 mL", "1.0 mL", "1.5 mL", "2.5 mL"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clark's Rule: (Weight / 150) x Adult Dose. (30 / 150) = 0.2. 0.2 x 5mL = 1.0 mL."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In integrative oncology, why might a practitioner advise a client to pause high-dose 'antioxidant' herbs like Green Tea extract (EGCG) during specific days of radiation therapy?",
            "options": ["They increase the risk of skin burns", "They may protect cancer cells from the oxidative damage intended by the radiation", "They cause severe diarrhea when combined with radiation", "They neutralize the radioactive isotopes before they reach the tumor"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While controversial, the prevailing clinical caution is that high-dose antioxidants may reduce the efficacy of treatments (like radiation or certain chemos) that rely on oxidative stress to kill cancer cells."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Which botanical is considered a 'Biofilm Disruptor' and is frequently used in CIRS or chronic Lyme protocols to expose sequestered pathogens to the immune system?",
            "options": ["Cistus incanus (Rock Rose)", "Althea officinalis (Marshmallow)", "Zea mays (Cornsilk)", "Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cistus incanus is rich in polyphenols that help break down the protective biofilm matrix created by pathogens, making them more vulnerable to herbal antimicrobials."

            "question": "A case study involves a 55-year-old male with 'Metabolic Endocrine Cascade' (MetS, low testosterone, high cortisol). Which herb addresses both the HPA axis and the insulin sensitivity aspect of this presentation?",
            "options": ["Valeriana officinalis", "Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil)", "Senna alexandrina", "Urtica dioica root"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
