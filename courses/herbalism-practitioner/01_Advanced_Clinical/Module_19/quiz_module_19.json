            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An antagonist binds to a receptor but does not activate it; instead, it blocks or 'antagonizes' the action of agonists or natural hormones/neurotransmitters."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is clinically significant in Herb-Drug Interactions (HDI) because it acts as a potent inducer of which enzyme?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort induces the CYP3A4 enzyme system in the liver, which accelerates the metabolism of many pharmaceuticals (like cyclosporine and warfarin), leading to sub-therapeutic drug levels."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children, especially infants, have a higher surface area-to-body weight ratio, which can lead to increased absorption of topical preparations and different metabolic requirements compared to adults."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "After one half-life (6 hours), 50% remains. After two half-lives (12 hours), 50% of that 50% remains, which is 25%."
