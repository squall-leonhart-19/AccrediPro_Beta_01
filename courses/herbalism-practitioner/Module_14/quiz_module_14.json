            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licorice inhibits the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme, which prevents the conversion of active cortisol into inactive cortisone, thereby extending cortisol's half-life."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Syndrome is characterized by the cluster of insulin resistance, lipid imbalances (high triglycerides/low HDL), and hypertension or central adiposity."
