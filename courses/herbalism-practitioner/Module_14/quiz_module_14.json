            "question": "In the ROOTS approach to endocrine health, what does the 'R' signify, and why is it prioritized first in the protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Regulation of Rhythm; to restore the circadian signaling of the HPA axis.",
                "Reduction of Resistance; specifically addressing insulin receptor sensitivity.",
                "Restoration of Reserves; focusing on replenishing micronutrients like Selenium.",
                "Rejuvenation of Receptors; cleaning cellular docking sites for hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ROOTS approach begins with Regulation of Rhythm, as the HPA axis and metabolic hormones like cortisol and insulin are deeply tied to circadian cycles. Without rhythmic stability, other interventions often fail."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which mineral is essential for the function of deiodinase enzymes, which facilitate the peripheral conversion of T4 to the more active T3 hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "Selenium",
                "Manganese",
                "Copper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a critical cofactor for deiodinase enzymes. A deficiency can lead to 'Low T3 Syndrome' even if T4 levels are adequate, a concept explored in Lesson 2 on Thyroid Vitality."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to the mechanism of action discussed in Lesson 3, how does Berberine primarily exert its hypoglycemic effects?",
            "options": [
                "By stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin directly.",
                "By blocking the absorption of all dietary fats in the small intestine.",
                "By activating Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK).",
                "By increasing the half-life of circulating glucagon."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Berberine is known as a 'metabolic master switch' because it activates AMPK, which improves insulin sensitivity and stimulates glucose uptake in muscle cells independently of insulin."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "When addressing 'Adrenal Fatigue' or HPA axis dysregulation, why might a practitioner choose Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) over Rhodiola rosea for a 'wired but tired' client?",
            "options": [
                "Ashwagandha is a stimulating adaptogen that increases cortisol quickly.",
                "Rhodiola is strictly for thyroid health and has no effect on adrenals.",
                "Ashwagandha is a calming adaptogen that modulates GABAergic signaling, making it better for hyper-reactive states.",
                "Ashwagandha contains high amounts of iodine which sedates the adrenal glands."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is categorized as a calming/tonifying adaptogen, whereas Rhodiola is more stimulating. For a client who is 'wired' (high evening cortisol/anxiety), Ashwagandha's GABA-mimetic effects are more appropriate."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a recognized diagnostic criterion for Metabolic Syndrome as outlined in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "HDL Cholesterol levels above 60 mg/dL.",
                "Fasting Triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL (or receiving therapy for high triglycerides).",
                "Blood pressure consistently below 110/70 mmHg.",
                "A body mass index (BMI) of exactly 22."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Syndrome is diagnosed when 3 out of 5 criteria are met; one of these is fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL. Other criteria include waist circumference, low HDL, high BP, and high fasting glucose."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses the 'Incretin Effect.' Which herbal category is most effective at stimulating GLP-1 secretion from L-cells in the gut to improve pancreatic response?",
            "options": [
                "Mucilaginous demulcents (e.g., Marshmallow root)",
                "Pungent carminatives (e.g., Ginger)",
                "Bitter tonics (e.g., Gentian or Artichoke leaf)",
                "Astringents (e.g., Witch Hazel)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bitter compounds interact with T2R receptors in the gut, which triggers the release of GLP-1 (an incretin hormone). This enhances insulin secretion in response to a meal and slows gastric emptying."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In the 'Thyroid-Adrenal Pivot' concept, why is it often recommended to support the adrenals before or alongside the thyroid?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid hormones decrease the metabolic rate, causing adrenal atrophy.",
                "Adrenal hormones like cortisol are required to transport iodine into the thyroid.",
                "Increasing thyroid function without adrenal support can 'burn out' the client by increasing metabolic demand beyond what the adrenals can support.",
                "Thyroid herbs are toxic to the adrenal medulla."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones act as the 'accelerator' for metabolism. If the adrenals (the 'fuel tank') are empty, pushing the accelerator can lead to a crash or exacerbated fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A 2021 study cited in the module regarding Gymnema sylvestre found that its primary unique action on glycemic regulation is:",
            "options": [
                "The permanent destruction of alpha cells in the pancreas.",
                "The temporary suppression of the 'sweet' taste receptors on the tongue and inhibition of glucose absorption in the small intestine.",
                "Increasing the excretion of glucose through the urinary tract.",
                "Converting excess glucose directly into muscle tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gymnemic acids occupy the sugar receptors on the tongue (reducing cravings) and the glucose receptors in the intestine, reducing the rate of sugar absorption."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old female presents with thinning hair, cold intolerance, and a sluggish gallbladder. Which herbal pairing addresses both the thyroid and the metabolic-digestive link?",
            "options": [
                "Fucus vesiculosus (Bladderwrack) and Iris versicolor (Blue Flag).",
                "Valeriana officinalis and Mentha piperita.",
                "Urtica dioica and Sambucus nigra.",
                "Passiflora incarnata and Crataegus oxyacantha."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bladderwrack provides iodine and trace minerals for the thyroid, while Blue Flag is a traditional 'alterative' used for glandular sluggishness and lymphatic/biliary stasis, common in hypothyroid profiles."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of using 'Trophorestoratives' in the context of long-term endocrine recovery?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a temporary 'boost' of energy similar to caffeine.",
                "To suppress hormone production when it is too high.",
                "To nourish and restore the structural and functional integrity of a specific organ or system over time.",
                "To replace the need for endogenous hormone production entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trophorestoratives (like Milky Oat seed for the nervous system or Saw Palmetto for the prostate) are used to 'feed' and restore the tissue, rather than just forcing a physiological change."
