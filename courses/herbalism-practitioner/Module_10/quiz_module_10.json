            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. framework for endocrine assessment, what does the 'T' specifically represent in the context of hormonal dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Output",
                "Tissue Sensitivity",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.O.O.T.S. framework, 'T' stands for Tissue Sensitivity. This addresses conditions like insulin resistance or androgen insensitivity where hormone levels may be normal, but the receptors are not responding appropriately."

                "45.1%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study by Chandrasekhar et al. (2012) demonstrated a 27.9% reduction in serum cortisol levels among adults with chronic stress using 300mg of Ashwagandha twice daily."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Which mineral is required for the deiodinase enzymes to successfully convert the pro-hormone Thyroxine (T4) into the active Triiodothyronine (T3)?",
            "options": [

                "Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Berberine is known as a potent AMPK activator, which enhances glucose uptake in muscle cells, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, and improves overall insulin sensitivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitex (Chaste Tree Berry) acts as a dopaminergic agonist, inhibiting the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. High prolactin can inhibit the corpus luteum, leading to low progesterone."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In Male Hormonal Health, Saw Palmetto (Serenoa repens) is clinically utilized for its ability to inhibit which enzyme responsible for converting Testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saw Palmetto inhibits the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, which prevents the conversion of testosterone into the more potent androgen DHT, which is implicated in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)."

                "It directly replaces cortisol in the bloodstream",
                "It acts as a sedative to the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licorice root contains glycyrrhetinic acid, which inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD), the enzyme that converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, thereby keeping cortisol active in the system longer."

                "Melatonin and Serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' occurs when chronic stress causes the body to divert the precursor pregnenolone toward cortisol production at the expense of DHEA and progesterone."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "According to the Module 10 deep dive on metabolic synergy, what is the 'Gold Standard' range for HbA1c when working with clients on blood sugar regulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While medical 'normal' is often higher, functional herbalism targets an HbA1c of below 5.4% for optimal metabolic health and longevity, as risk for complications increases even within the 'pre-diabetic' range."
