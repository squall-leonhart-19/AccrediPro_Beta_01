            "question": "In the 'Triune' formulation model, what is the typical percentage range allocated to the 'Lead' or 'Base' herb (the primary therapeutic agent)?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "30-40%",
                "50-70%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In professional botanical formulation, the Lead herb typically comprises 50-70% of the formula to ensure a strong therapeutic direction, while supportive and catalyst herbs fill the remaining percentage."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A practitioner is formulating for a client with high levels of resins and oleoresins (e.g., Commiphora myrrha). Which alcohol concentration is required for optimal extraction?",
            "options": [
                "25-30% Ethanol",
                "40-50% Ethanol",
                "60-70% Ethanol",
                "90-95% Ethanol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Resins and essential oils are poorly soluble in water and require high-percentage ethanol (90-95%) to break down the resinous matrix and keep the compounds in solution."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary clinical advantage of the percolation method over the maceration method for tincture production?",
            "options": [
                "It requires significantly less crude herb material.",
                "The extraction is completed in 24–48 hours rather than 2–6 weeks.",
                "It is better suited for mucilaginous herbs like Althaea officinalis.",
                "It does not require the use of a menstruum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Percolation is a high-speed extraction method that uses gravity to pass menstruum through a column of powdered herb, achieving a finished extract in 24-48 hours with high precision."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard clinical decoctions require 20-30 minutes of simmering in a covered vessel to extract alkaloids, tannins, and minerals from hard plant parts without excessive evaporation."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Case Study: A client is prescribed a 1:5 tincture with a dosage of 5mL three times daily. How much crude dried herb is the client consuming in total per day?",

                "15 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a 1:5 ratio, 5mL of liquid contains the extract of 1g of herb. Since the client takes 5mL three times a day (15mL total), they are consuming the equivalent of 3g of crude herb daily."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which 'Catalyst' or 'Driver' herb is frequently added to formulas at 5-10% to improve peripheral circulation and enhance the delivery of other constituents?",
            "options": [
                "Zingiber officinale (Ginger)",
                "Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zingiber officinale (Ginger) acts as a circulatory stimulant and 'driver,' increasing the bioavailability and systemic distribution of the primary herbs in a formulation."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "According to research on patient adherence (Lesson 8), which organoleptic profile is most likely to cause 'therapeutic fatigue' and lead to discontinued use in long-term protocols?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While bitter herbs are therapeutically vital for digestion, intense bitterness is the leading cause of poor patient compliance. Practitioners must often use masking agents like glycerin or licorice to improve adherence."

                "Glycerin extracts resins better than alcohol.",
                "Glycerin is a more potent preservative than 25% alcohol.",
                "Glycerin provides a low-glycemic, alcohol-free medium with a sweet taste.",
                "Glycerin increases the extraction of toxic alkaloids."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycerites are preferred for children and those with alcohol sensitivities because they are palatable, alcohol-free, and effectively extract many water-soluble constituents."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Electuaries are ancient but effective preparations where powdered herbs are incorporated into honey or fruit pastes, making them easy to consume and improving the taste of bitter powders."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "When formulating for a client with a 'Dry' constitution, which type of herb should be included as a 'Supportive' agent to balance the drying effects of ethanol or tannins?",
            "options": [
                "Diuretics (e.g., Juniper)",
                "Demulcents (e.g., Slippery Elm)",
                "Astringents (e.g., Oak Bark)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Demulcents are rich in mucilage and provide a moistening effect, which is essential when formulating for dry constitutions or when using herbs that may otherwise be too drying or irritating."
