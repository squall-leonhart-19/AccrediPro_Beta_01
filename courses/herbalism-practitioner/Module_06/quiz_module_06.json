            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how bitter herbs (Amara) initiate the 'cephalic phase' of digestion?",
            "options": [
                "Direct stimulation of the proton pump in parietal cells",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bitter compounds bind to T2R (Type 2 Taste Receptors) on the tongue, which triggers a vagal reflex. This reflex stimulates the release of saliva, gastric acid, and bile before food even reaches the stomach."

                "DGL is only effective against H. pylori, whereas standard licorice is not"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycyrrhizin can cause pseudo-aldosteronism, leading to sodium retention and hypertension. DGL provides the gut-healing benefits of licorice without these systemic cardiovascular risks."
