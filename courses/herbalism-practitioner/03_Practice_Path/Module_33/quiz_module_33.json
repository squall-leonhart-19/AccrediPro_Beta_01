            "question": "An herbalist informs a client, 'This tincture will treat your hypertension and replace your Lisinopril.' Why does this violate the professional scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "It is a 'structure-function' claim rather than a 'disease' claim.",
                "It constitutes the unlicensed practice of medicine by diagnosing and prescribing.",
                "Herbalists are only permitted to treat hypertension if they have a Master's degree.",
                "The statement is legal as long as the herbalist provides a disclaimer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In most jurisdictions, diagnosing a specific medical condition (hypertension) and advising a client to discontinue a prescription drug (Lisinopril) constitutes the unlicensed practice of medicine. Herbalists must focus on supporting body systems rather than treating named diseases."

                "The product must be sold only in pharmacies or licensed dispensaries."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DSHEA requires that any product making a structure-function claim must feature the mandatory disclaimer: 'This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.'"

            "explanation": "Structure-function claims must describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the normal structure or function in humans (e.g., 'supports healthy joint flexibility'). Mentioning specific diseases like arthritis or diabetes turns the statement into an illegal disease claim."
