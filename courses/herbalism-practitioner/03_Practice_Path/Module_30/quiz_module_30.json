            "question": "Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, which of the following statements is a practitioner legally permitted to use in marketing materials?",
            "options": [
                "This herbal tincture cures chronic insomnia.",
                "This formula is designed to treat symptoms of clinical depression.",
                "This botanical blend supports a healthy nervous system and promotes relaxation.",
                "This product is a safe alternative to pharmaceutical ACE inhibitors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must use 'structure-function' claims rather than 'disease' claims. Supporting a 'healthy nervous system' describes an effect on the body's structure/function, whereas 'curing' or 'treating' a specific disease is prohibited for supplements."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that a clear clinical niche increases referral efficiency by approximately 40% because it makes the practitioner the 'obvious choice' for specific conditions, simplifying the mental pathway for referrers."

                "Critically failing; CAC should never exceed $10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An ideal LTV:CAC ratio is 3:1. In this case, the ratio is 2:1 ($300:$150), which indicates the practitioner is spending too much to acquire a client relative to the revenue that client generates, making long-term sustainability difficult."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "It automatically disqualifies the practitioner from holding liability insurance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While ethically sound for accessibility, sliding scales must be mathematically balanced. If too many clients are at the lower end without a sufficient volume of full-fee clients, the practitioner risks financial instability and burnout."
