            "question": "In the V.I.T.A.L. Method™, how is 'Vigor' distinguished from 'Vitality' during an initial assessment?",
            "options": [
                "Vitality is the current energy level, while Vigor is the underlying constitutional reserve.",
                "Vigor is the metabolic rate, while Vitality is the emotional state.",
                "Vitality is the inherited strength, while Vigor is the temporary boost from stimulants.",
                "There is no distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in clinical documentation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "According to Lesson 1, Vitality refers to the client's present expression of life force, whereas Vigor represents the deep constitutional reserves and the body's innate resilience to stress and disease."

            "question": "A client presents with a bright red tongue, a rapid pulse (95 bpm), and reports feeling 'irritable and overheated.' Which energetic model does this most likely represent?",
            "options": [
                "Damp-Cold",
                "Dry-Atrophy",
                "Heat/Excitation",
                "Laxity/Stagnation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 defines Heat/Excitation through physiological markers such as redness, increased pulse rate, and psychological irritability, indicating an overactive metabolic state."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the 2022 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 4 regarding tongue analysis, what was the reported inter-rater reliability (kappa coefficient) for identifying 'thick greasy coating' as an indicator of Dampness?",
            "options": [
                "0.42 (Moderate agreement)",
                "0.65 (Substantial agreement)",
                "0.88 (Almost perfect agreement)",
                "0.15 (Slight agreement)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that while pulse analysis varies by practitioner, tongue coating analysis shows substantial agreement (κ = 0.65) among trained practitioners for identifying Dampness and metabolic stagnation."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When assessing 'Tissue States,' which condition is characterized by a loss of structural integrity, chronic leaking of fluids, and a 'boggy' texture?",
            "options": [
                "Tension (Wind)",
                "Laxity (Damp-Relaxation)",
                "Atrophy (Dryness)",
                "Irritation (Heat)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 describes Laxity as a state where tissues lose their tone and ability to hold fluids, often manifesting as edema or chronic discharge, requiring astringent herbs to restore 'tonus.'"

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Case Study 4.A (Sarah, 42), her 'Wiry' pulse and 'Scalloped' tongue edges were used to identify which underlying root cause?",
            "options": [
                "Acute bacterial infection",
                "Liver Qi Stagnation with Spleen Qi Deficiency",

                "Excessive Vitality leading to burnout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As detailed in Lesson 4, scalloped edges (teeth marks) indicate Spleen Qi Deficiency/Dampness, while a wiry pulse indicates tension or stagnation, frequently associated with the Liver energetic system."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "During the 'Intake Mastery' phase, why is the 'Golden 10 Minutes' technique critical for a practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "It is the maximum time allowed for the entire consultation.",
                "It allows the client to speak uninterrupted to reveal the narrative root of their condition.",
                "It is the time required for the pulse to stabilize before measurement.",
                "It is the period used to cross-reference symptoms with a Materia Medica."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 emphasizes that allowing the client to speak for the first 10 minutes without interruption often reveals the 'hidden' primary concern that structured questioning might miss."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'Symptomatic Relief' rather than 'Root Cause' intervention in the V.I.T.A.L. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "Using bitters to stimulate HCL production for chronic malabsorption.",
                "Providing nervines to support the HPA axis during a period of grief.",

                "Adjusting dietary minerals to resolve chronic muscle cramping."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 explains that masking fatigue with stimulants without addressing the underlying exhaustion is a suppressive/symptomatic approach that can further deplete the Vis Medicatrix Naturae."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "How does a practitioner measure the 'Vis Medicatrix Naturae' (The Healing Power of Nature) in a client with chronic disease?",
            "options": [
                "By measuring the speed of recovery from a common cold or minor injury.",
                "By the total number of symptoms the client reports.",
                "By the client's ability to afford expensive supplements.",
                "By the presence or absence of a genetic predisposition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 teaches that the strength of the Vis Medicatrix Naturae is best assessed by observing the body’s self-regulatory capacity—how effectively it returns to homeostasis after a stressor."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "When documenting a 'Vitality Baseline,' which metric is used to quantify the client's subjective experience of their energy throughout the day?",
            "options": [
                "The Diurnal Energy Curve (DEC)",
                "The Resting Heart Rate (RHR)",
                "The Body Mass Index (BMI)",
                "The Liver Enzyme Panel"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 8 introduces the Diurnal Energy Curve (DEC) as a standardized way to document energy fluctuations, helping practitioners distinguish between morning sluggishness (Dampness) and evening crashes (Deficiency)."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A pulse that feels like a 'taut violin string' is clinically classified as 'Wiry.' This is the primary pulse indicator for which tissue state?",
            "options": [
                "Laxity",
                "Atrophy",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As covered in Lessons 3 and 4, a Wiry pulse is the hallmark of the Tension tissue state, indicating constriction of the vessels, nervous system excitation, or physical spasm."
