            "question": "According to the 2008 Cochrane meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 1, what specific benefit did Crataegus (Hawthorn) extract demonstrate for patients with NYHA Class II Heart Failure?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% reduction in total cholesterol levels within 30 days",
                "Significant improvement in exercise tolerance and reduction in pressure-heart rate product",
                "Complete reversal of myocardial infarction damage in 12% of participants",
                "Spontaneous regeneration of the mitral valve tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis of 14 trials (n=855) showed that Hawthorn extract significantly increased exercise tolerance and decreased the pressure-heart rate product, a measure of myocardial oxygen demand."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In the management of hypertension (Lesson 2), a 2015 randomized controlled trial compared Hibiscus sabdariffa to Lisinopril. What was the primary finding regarding systolic blood pressure?",
            "options": [
                "Hibiscus was found to be 5 times more potent than Lisinopril",
                "Hibiscus had no effect on blood pressure compared to placebo",
                "150mg/kg of Hibiscus anthocyanins showed similar efficacy to 10mg of Lisinopril in lowering systolic BP",
                "Hibiscus caused a dangerous spike in potassium levels that Lisinopril did not"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that Hibiscus tea or standardized extracts can lower systolic BP by approximately 7-12 mmHg, showing comparable efficacy to low-dose ACE inhibitors in mild-to-moderate cases."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A client presents with cold extremities, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and poor memory. Which circulatory stimulant from Lesson 3 is most indicated due to its ability to improve both peripheral and cerebral blood flow?",
            "options": [
                "Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion)",
                "Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rosmarinus officinalis acts as a circulatory stimulant and rubefacient, historically used to 'warm' the extremities and improve cognitive function via increased cerebral circulation."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Respiratory Energetics.' Which herbal profile is most appropriate for a 'Dry, Non-productive Cough' characterized by irritated, red mucosa and a tickle in the throat?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulating Expectorants like Inula helenium (Elecampane)",
                "Drying Astringents like Hamamelis virginiana (Witch Hazel)",
                "Demulcents like Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow root)",
                "Pungent Diaphoretics like Capsicum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dry coughs require demulcents (mucilaginous herbs) to coat the mucosa and provide moisture, whereas stimulating expectorants are reserved for damp, productive coughs with thick mucus."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism of action for the herb Albizia lebbeck in the treatment of allergic asthma, as detailed in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a direct bronchodilator similar to Albuterol",
                "It stabilizes mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and inflammatory mediators",
                "It dries the lungs by inhibiting all mucus production",
                "It increases the heart rate to improve oxygen delivery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Albizia lebbeck is a potent immunomodulator and mast cell stabilizer, making it highly effective for preventing the allergic cascade in asthma and hay fever."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, Galium aparine (Cleavers) is described as a 'Lymphatic Alterative.' For which clinical presentation would this herb be most specifically indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Acute bacterial pneumonia with high fever",
                "Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) and localized fluid stasis/edema",
                "Hypotension and bradycardia",
                "Severe constipation and dry skin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cleavers is a classic lymphatic tonic used specifically for swollen glands, lymphatic congestion, and 'damp' skin conditions like psoriasis where the lymphatic system is sluggish."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Why is the herb Phytolacca americana (Poke Root) considered a 'high-potency' herb that requires extreme caution (Lesson 7 & 8)?",
            "options": [
                "It is completely inert and has no medicinal value",
                "It contains mitogenic proteins and alkaloids that can cause severe emesis and toxicity in low doses",
                "It turns the skin green upon contact",
                "It interacts exclusively with Vitamin C, neutralizing its effects"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Poke root is a powerful lymphatic but has a very narrow therapeutic window. Overdose causes severe vomiting, diarrhea, and respiratory depression due to its toxic phytolaccatoxin content."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "When monitoring a client taking Cardiac Glycosides (like those found in Digitalis), which electrolyte imbalance significantly increases the risk of herb-induced toxicity?",
            "options": [
                "Hypernatremia (High Sodium)",
                "Hypokalemia (Low Potassium)",

                "Hypomagnesemia (Low Magnesium)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low potassium (hypokalemia) sensitizes the heart to cardiac glycosides, increasing the risk of arrhythmias and Digitalis toxicity. This is why combining cardiac glycosides with potassium-depleting diuretics is dangerous."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, Inula helenium (Elecampane) is specifically indicated for 'Damp' respiratory conditions. What is its effect on thick, stuck mucus?",
            "options": [
                "It hardens the mucus to prevent it from moving",
                "It acts as a stimulating expectorant, thinning the mucus and promoting its expulsion",
                "It converts mucus into carbon dioxide for exhalation",
                "It has no effect on mucus, only on the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elecampane is rich in volatile oils and inulin, acting as a warming, stimulating expectorant that helps break up and move thick, stagnant phlegm from the lower respiratory tract."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client on Warfarin (a blood thinner). Based on Lesson 8, which herb should be avoided or strictly monitored due to its potential to increase bleeding risk through anti-platelet activity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High doses of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) can inhibit platelet aggregation, potentially potentiating the effects of anticoagulant drugs like Warfarin and increasing the risk of hemorrhage."
