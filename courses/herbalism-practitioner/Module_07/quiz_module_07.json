            "question": "In the ROOTS Assessment framework for cardiovascular health, what does the 'R' (Resilience) primarily evaluate?",
            "options": [
                "The resting heart rate of the client over a 24-hour period",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a marker of autonomic nervous system balance",
                "The ability of the arterial walls to withstand high systolic pressure",
                "The rate of recovery after a standard 10-minute aerobic stress test"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the ROOTS framework, Resilience refers to the heart's ability to adapt to stressors, which is clinically measured via Heart Rate Variability (HRV). High HRV indicates a resilient, well-regulated autonomic nervous system."

            "question": "A 2015 meta-analysis of clinical trials found that Hibiscus sabdariffa was as effective as which class of pharmaceutical medication for mild-to-moderate hypertension?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., Amlodipine)",
                "Beta-Blockers (e.g., Metoprolol)",
                "ACE Inhibitors (e.g., Captopril/Lisinopril)",
                "Loop Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that Hibiscus sabdariffa (standardized to anthocyanin content) shows comparable efficacy to low-dose ACE inhibitors like Captopril in lowering both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

            "question": "Crataegus spp. (Hawthorn) is classified as a cardiac trophorestorative. What is its primary mechanism for increasing myocardial contractility without increasing oxygen demand?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump similarly to Digoxin",
                "Inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase, increasing intracellular calcium sensitivity",
                "Direct stimulation of Beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart",
                "Rapid depletion of intracellular sodium to force calcium efflux"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crataegus acts differently than cardiac glycosides; it inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase, which increases the availability of cyclic AMP. This enhances the force of contraction (inotropy) while simultaneously improving coronary blood flow and oxygen utilization."

            "question": "When addressing Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI), Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) is standardized to 'Escin'. What is the primary physiological action of Escin?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the production of Red Blood Cells to improve oxygenation",
                "Dilating the deep veins to prevent blood pooling in the calves",
                "Reducing capillary permeability and increasing venous tone by inhibiting lysosomal enzymes",
                "Acting as a systemic anticoagulant to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Escin works by sealing 'leaky' capillaries (reducing permeability) and inhibiting enzymes like elastase and hyaluronidase that break down the vein walls, thereby improving venous tone and reducing edema."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In Metabolic Cardiology, why is it considered vital to co-administer Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) when a client is using Red Yeast Rice (Monascus purpureus)?",
            "options": [
                "Red Yeast Rice blocks the absorption of CoQ10 in the small intestine",
                "The Monacolin K in Red Yeast Rice inhibits the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, which is required for endogenous CoQ10 synthesis",
                "CoQ10 is necessary to activate the statin-like compounds in the herb",
                "Red Yeast Rice causes rapid excretion of CoQ10 through the renal system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red Yeast Rice contains Monacolin K, which is chemically identical to Lovastatin. Because it inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, it shuts down the mevalonate pathway, which produces both cholesterol and CoQ10, potentially leading to muscle fatigue and mitochondrial dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leonurus cardiaca (Motherwort) is the premier 'nervine cardiotonic.' It is specifically indicated for palpitations, tachycardia, and 'heart flutters' that have an emotional or hyperthyroid origin."

                "Urtica dioica (Nettle Leaf)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) is the premier herb for moving blood stasis in the cardiovascular system. It is widely used in Asian clinical settings to improve microcirculation and protect the endothelium from oxidative damage."

            "question": "According to the lesson on Safety and Integration, what is the 'potentiating' risk of combining Crataegus (Hawthorn) with pharmaceutical Cardiac Glycosides (like Digoxin)?",
            "options": [
                "It may cause the Digoxin to become completely inactive",
                "It may increase the effect of Digoxin, potentially leading to bradycardia or toxicity at standard doses",
                "It causes the kidneys to excrete Digoxin too rapidly",
                "It increases the risk of a hypertensive crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hawthorn can potentiate the effects of cardiac glycosides like Digoxin. While this can be used therapeutically under strict supervision to lower the drug dose, in general practice, it requires caution as it may lead to excessively slow heart rates or increased drug sensitivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Commiphora mukul (Guggul) contains guggulsterones, which are known to modulate the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR), a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, leading to increased cholesterol clearance."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Vascular Resilience' formulation, what is the primary reason for including Vitamin C-rich herbs like Rosa canina (Rosehips) alongside flavonoid-rich herbs?",
            "options": [
                "To improve the flavor of the tincture",
                "To prevent the oxidation of flavonoids and synergistically strengthen the collagen matrix of the blood vessels",
                "To act as a natural preservative for the formula",
                "To increase the blood pressure-raising effects of the other herbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C and flavonoids (like those in Hawthorn or Bilberry) work in a 'redox cycle' synergy. Vitamin C helps keep flavonoids in their active state, and together they cross-link collagen fibers to strengthen the structural integrity of the vascular walls."
