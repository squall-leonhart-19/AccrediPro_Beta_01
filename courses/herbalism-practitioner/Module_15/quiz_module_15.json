            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. assessment framework for endocrine health, what does the 'O' representing 'Oxidation & Organ Function' primarily evaluate in a client with suspected metabolic syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "The patient's subjective emotional response to stress",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.O.O.T.S. framework, 'Oxidation & Organ Function' focuses on the physiological foundations, specifically how the liver processes hormones (detoxification) and the level of oxidative stress/inflammation (e.g., hs-CRP) affecting endocrine receptor sensitivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Berberine, through AMPK activation, shows comparable results to Metformin in lowering blood glucose and HbA1c, often with the added benefit of improving lipid profiles."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lycopus virginicus (Bugleweed) is a specific trophorestorative for hyperthyroidism as it can inhibit the binding of TSH to thyroid membranes and reduce the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Regarding 'Adrenal Resilience,' why is the term 'Adrenal Fatigue' considered clinically inaccurate in modern functional herbalism?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands never actually stop producing hormones until death",
                "The issue is typically a signaling dysfunction in the HPA axis rather than gland failure",
                "Cortisol levels are always high in stressed individuals, never low",
                "Herbalists are legally prohibited from using the word 'fatigue'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern research shows that 'adrenal fatigue' is actually HPA Axis Dysregulation, where the brain's communication with the adrenals is altered, or the feedback loop is impaired, rather than the glands being 'worn out'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitex is dopaminergic; by binding to D2 receptors in the pituitary, it inhibits the overproduction of prolactin, which in turn helps normalize the progesterone-to-estrogen ratio."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saw Palmetto is the gold standard in herbal medicine for BPH and androgenic balance because it inhibits the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme responsible for converting testosterone into the more potent DHT."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that Spearmint tea (Mentha spicata) has significant anti-androgenic effects in women with PCOS, lowering free testosterone levels and improving hirsutism."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "What is the primary safety concern when using high doses of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) for adrenal support over an extended period?",

                "It increases the rate of caffeine metabolism, making coffee ineffective"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licorice contains glycyrrhizin, which can inhibit the enzyme that breaks down cortisol, leading to an apparent excess of mineralocorticoids (pseudo-aldosteronism), causing sodium retention, potassium loss, and high blood pressure."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha can increase T4 levels. If a client is already on T4 medication (Levothyroxine), the herb may cause them to become over-medicated/hyperthyroid. Monitoring and physician-led dose adjustment are essential."
