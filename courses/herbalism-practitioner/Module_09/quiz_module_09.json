            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. framework, which tissue state is characterized by a lack of digestive enzymes, pale tongue, and a 'heavy' feeling after eating small meals?",
            "options": [
                "Irritation/Heat",
                "Depression/Atrophy",
                "Stagnation/Damp",
                "Tension/Spasm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Depression/Atrophy indicates a lack of functional activity and secretions, often presenting with low HCL, enzyme deficiency, and a pale, thin tongue."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "The 'Bitter Reflex' is mediated by T2R receptors. According to the lesson on upper GI function, where are these receptors located besides the tongue?",
            "options": [
                "Only the tongue and soft palate",
                "The stomach, bile duct, and respiratory tract",
                "The large intestine exclusively",
                "T2R receptors are only found in the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Extra-oral T2R receptors are found throughout the GI tract, including the stomach and bile ducts, where they trigger the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) and stimulate bile flow."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A client presents with sluggish fat digestion and pale stools. You decide to use a 'Choleretic' agent. What is the primary mechanism of a choleretic?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulating the gallbladder to contract and expel stored bile",
                "Increasing the production of bile by the hepatocytes in the liver",
                "Binding to bile acids in the colon to prevent reabsorption",
                "Inhibiting the breakdown of bilirubin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While cholagogues stimulate gallbladder contraction, choleretics specifically increase the volume of bile produced by the liver itself."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When addressing 'Leaky Gut' or intestinal permeability, why are high-mucilage demulcents like Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow) used in the Gut-Immune Interface?",
            "options": [
                "They act as a physical barrier and provide prebiotic substrate for the GALT",
                "They chemically neutralize stomach acid",
                "They stimulate the production of hydrochloric acid",
                "They act as systemic antibiotics to kill pathogens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Demulcents provide a soothing physical film over the mucosa and contain polysaccharides that interact with the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) to modulate immune response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "The Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is crucial for preventing SIBO. Which factor is most likely to inhibit the MMC's 'sweeping' action in the lower GI?",
            "options": [
                "Intermittent fasting for 12 hours",
                "The use of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) as a prokinetic",
                "Frequent grazing or snacking between meals",
                "Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MMC only occurs during the inter-digestive (fasting) phase. Eating or snacking stops the MMC, which can lead to bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Regarding Metabolic Homeostasis, Berberine is noted for its ability to lower blood glucose. What is its primary molecular target?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine is a potent activator of AMPK, often called the 'metabolic master switch,' which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake."

            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut (the enteric nervous system), highlighting the importance of the Gut-Brain Axis?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "30-40%",
                "50%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Roughly 90-95% of the body's serotonin is synthesized in the enterochromaffin cells of the gut, influencing both motility and mood."

                "The Reset begins with Reinoculation in Week 1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The protocol typically follows: 1. Remove/Stimulate, 2. Repair/Soothe, 3. Reinoculate/Restore. Reinoculation is the final stage once the environment is prepared."

            "options": [
                "Strong Anthraquinone Laxatives (e.g., Senna)",
                "Carminative Nervines (e.g., Matricaria chamomilla)",
                "Pungent Stimulants (e.g., Cayenne)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Carminative nervines address both the physical spasm (tension) and the psychological trigger (stress) via the Gut-Brain Axis."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "According to the clinical data presented in Lesson 2, how long before a meal should liquid bitters be administered for maximum cephalic phase activation?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately after finishing the meal",
                "15-20 minutes before the meal",
                "2 hours before the meal",
                "Bitters should only be taken on an empty stomach at bedtime"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Taking bitters 15-20 minutes before eating allows the T2R receptors to signal the vagus nerve, priming the stomach with HCL and the pancreas with enzymes before food arrives."
