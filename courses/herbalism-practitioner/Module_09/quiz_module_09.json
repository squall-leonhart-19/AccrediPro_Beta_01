            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "In the R.O.O.T.S. framework of digestion, which 'Tissue State' is characterized by a lack of hydrochloric acid (hypochlorhydria), pale tongue with teeth marks, and systemic 'coldness'?",
            "options": ["Tissue Irritation (Heat)", "Tissue Atrophy (Depression)", "Tissue Stagnation (Dampness)", "Tissue Constriction (Tension)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tissue Atrophy, or the 'Depression' state, is characterized by a lack of vital function, low secretions (like HCL), and poor nutrient absorption, often presenting as a pale, flabby tongue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "The 'Bitter Reflex' is mediated by T2R receptors. According to the lesson on upper GI function, where are these receptors located beyond the tongue?",
            "options": ["Only on the tongue and soft palate", "Tongue, stomach, and small intestine only", "Tongue, stomach, pancreas, and respiratory tract", "Tongue and esophagus only"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T2R (bitter) receptors are extra-oral; they are found throughout the GI tract (stomach, pancreas, intestines) and even in the respiratory system, influencing metabolic hormones and innate immunity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A practitioner wants to increase the *production* of bile by the hepatocytes. Which class of herbal action is specifically required?",
            "options": ["Cholagogue", "Choleretic", "Carminative", "Antispasmodic"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choleretics (like Curcuma longa) stimulate the liver to produce more bile, whereas Cholagogues (like Taraxacum officinale root) stimulate the gallbladder to contract and release stored bile."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, the 'Gut-Immune Interface' was discussed. What is the primary mechanism by which high-mucilage demulcents like Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow) support the mucosal barrier?",
            "options": ["By chemically neutralizing gastric acid", "By forming a physical polyholoside film over inflamed epithelium", "By stimulating the production of hydrochloric acid", "By increasing systemic cortisol levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Demulcents contain high-molecular-weight polysaccharides (polyholosides) that form a physical, protective film over mucous membranes, reducing irritation and allowing the underlying tissue to heal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "The Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is the 'housekeeping' wave of the GI tract. According to Lesson 5, which state of the Autonomic Nervous System is required for the MMC to function optimally?",
            "options": ["Sympathetic Dominance (Fight or Flight)", "Parasympathetic Dominance (Rest and Digest)", "Enteric Isolation", "Adrenal Surge"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MMC only occurs in the inter-digestive (fasting) state and is heavily dependent on Parasympathetic (Vagal) tone; stress and Sympathetic dominance inhibit these waves, leading to SIBO and stagnation."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A 2019 meta-analysis (n=2,569) discussed in Lesson 6 compared Berberine to Metformin. What was the primary finding regarding its effect on metabolic homeostasis?",
            "options": ["Berberine was significantly less effective than Metformin", "Berberine showed no effect on HbA1c levels", "Berberine was comparable to Metformin in reducing HbA1c and FBG", "Berberine only worked if combined with insulin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Berberine (found in Hydrastis and Berberis spp.) has a clinical efficacy comparable to Metformin in reducing Hemoglobin A1c and Fasting Blood Glucose by activating AMPK pathways."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Which nervine herb is specifically indicated for 'nervous indigestion' where stress manifests as gastric spasms and 'knots' in the stomach?",
            "options": ["Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort)", "Melissa officinalis (Lemon Balm)", "Arctium lappa (Burdock)", "Salvia officinalis (Sage)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melissa officinalis is a classic 'trophorestorative' for the gut-brain axis, acting as a carminative and mild sedative to resolve psychosomatic digestive tension."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "During Phase 1 (The Soothing Phase) of the 3-Month Digestive Reset, what is the primary clinical objective?",
            "options": ["Aggressive antimicrobial eradication of dysbiosis", "Stimulating intense bile flow with strong cholagogues", "Reducing inflammation and restoring mucosal integrity", "High-dose prebiotic loading to shift the microbiome"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 focuses on 'extinguishing the fire.' Before stimulating or weeding the gut, the practitioner must soothe inflammation and repair the mucosal barrier to prevent 'die-off' reactions later."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "In the context of Hepatic Pathways (Lesson 3), which botanical is known to increase intracellular glutathione levels by up to 35%, protecting the liver from oxidative stress?",
            "options": ["Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle)", "Mentha piperita (Peppermint)", "Zingiber officinale (Ginger)", "Foeniculum vulgare (Fennel)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Silymarin (from Milk Thistle) is clinically proven to increase glutathione levels and stabilize hepatocyte membranes against toxins."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Tissue Stagnation' (Dampness), characterized by a thick greasy tongue coating and sluggish bowel movements. Which herbal strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": ["Heavy demulcents and astringents", "Pungent carminatives and stimulating bitters", "Sedative nervines and mucilage", "Cooling refrigerants and tannins"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tissue Stagnation/Dampness requires 'moving' and 'drying' actions. Pungent carminatives (like Ginger) and stimulating bitters (like Gentian) increase motility and clear metabolic waste."
