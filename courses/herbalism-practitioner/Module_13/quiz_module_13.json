            "question": "When transitioning a client from the acute phase to long-term integration, which shift in herbal strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the dosage of 'heroic' or high-potency antimicrobials",
                "Shifting from symptomatic relief to trophorestorative tonics that support organ systems",
                "Maintaining the exact same protocol for a minimum of 12 months to ensure stability",
                "Discontinuing all herbal support immediately to test the body's resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term integration focuses on 'tonification' and 'trophorestoration'—rebuilding and nourishing tissues—rather than the 'heroic' or suppressive actions often used in acute phases."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of Circadian Synergy (Lesson 2), why is the timing of adaptogen administration critical?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the herbs reach the liver exactly at noon for detoxification",
                "To prevent the herbs from being neutralized by stomach acid during digestion",
                "To align with the body's natural diurnal cortisol rhythm and HPA-axis activity",
                "To maximize the absorption of minerals like calcium and magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Timing herbs to align with circadian rhythms, such as taking stimulating adaptogens in the morning to mirror the cortisol awakening response, enhances their efficacy and supports the HPA-axis."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In 'The Herbalist’s Kitchen' (Lesson 3), which category of herbs is recommended for daily culinary integration to support long-term mineral status?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutritive herbs are safe for daily use in food and infusions, providing essential minerals and vitamins that support long-term metabolic health and constitutional strength."

            "question": "A client reports a 70% reduction in symptoms but has reached a 'plateau' after 3 months. What is the recommended practitioner response per Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "Double the current dosage to break through the resistance",

                "Switch the entire protocol to synthetic pharmaceuticals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Plateaus often occur due to receptor downregulation or the body reaching a new homeostatic set point. Pulsed dosing (e.g., 5 days on, 2 days off) can help 'wake up' the physiological response."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spring is traditionally the time for 'cleansing' or supporting the liver and lymphatic system. Alteratives (blood purifiers) and hepatics are used to clear metabolic waste accumulated during winter."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintenance dosing aims to provide the minimum effective stimulus to keep the body in equilibrium, often using pulsed dosing to maintain long-term sensitivity."
