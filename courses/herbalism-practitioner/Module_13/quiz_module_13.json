            "options": [
                "Clearing metabolic waste from the liver and kidneys",
                "Restoring the rhythmic timing and feedback loops of the HPA/HPG axes",

                "Addressing the nutritional deficiencies that serve as cofactors for hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Organize' stage in the ROOTS method focuses on the communication pathways and feedback loops (like the HPA, HPT, and HPG axes) to ensure the body’s 'biological clock' and hormonal signals are synchronized."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on the HPA Axis, which adaptogen is most appropriate for a client in a 'state of exhaustion' characterized by low morning cortisol (hypocortisolism) and chronic fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "Panax ginseng (Asian Ginseng)",
                "Melissa officinalis (Lemon Balm)",
                "Lavandula angustifolia (Lavender)",
                "Passiflora incarnata (Passionflower)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Panax ginseng is a stimulating adaptogen that helps 'lift' the HPA axis response, making it ideal for hypocortisolism/exhaustion, whereas the other options are nervines or relaxants."

                "Directly binding to glucose in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Berberine is a potent AMPK activator, which improves insulin sensitivity, increases glucose uptake in cells, and reduces hepatic glucose production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitex acts on the pituitary gland via dopaminergic pathways to lower prolactin. High prolactin can inhibit the corpus luteum, so lowering it helps normalize progesterone levels in the luteal phase."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serenoa repens is well-documented for its ability to inhibit the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone (DHT) associated with prostate enlargement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are most sensitive to short-wavelength blue light in the 460-480 nm range, which signals the pineal gland to stop melatonin synthesis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions; the ROOTS approach prioritizes insulin sensitivity (e.g., Berberine, Cinnamon) and reducing the 'inflammaging' that drives insulin resistance."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which botanical is considered a 'Trophorestorative' for the HPA axis, specifically helping to 'rebuild' the system after long-term corticosteroid use or extreme burnout?",

            "question": "In the context of the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (HPA Axis physiology), what happens when a client is under chronic, high-intensity stress?",
            "options": [
                "The body prioritizes the production of DHEA over Cortisol",
                "The body prioritizes the production of Cortisol at the expense of sex hormones",
                "Progesterone levels increase significantly to buffer the stress",
                "The thyroid increases T3 production to match the stress demand"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) occurs when the body diverts the precursor pregnenolone toward cortisol production to survive stress, leading to deficiencies in DHEA, progesterone, and testosterone."
