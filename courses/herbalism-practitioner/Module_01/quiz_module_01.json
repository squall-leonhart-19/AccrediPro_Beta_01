            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine (EBM), which of the following represents 'Level 1' evidence for clinical decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "A single well-designed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)",
                "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of multiple RCTs",
                "Case-control studies and cohort studies",
                "Expert consensus and traditional use monographs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are considered the gold standard of evidence because they synthesize data from multiple high-quality trials, reducing the impact of bias in individual studies."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme. What is the primary clinical consequence of this induction?",
            "options": [
                "Increased plasma concentration of co-administered drugs",
                "Decreased metabolism and delayed excretion of drugs",
                "Reduced efficacy of drugs like cyclosporine and oral contraceptives",
                "Total inhibition of the Phase II glucuronidation pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Induction of CYP3A4 increases the metabolic rate of drugs processed by this enzyme, leading to lower plasma levels and reduced therapeutic efficacy, which can be life-threatening in the case of immunosuppressants."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis found that approximately what percentage of commercial herbal supplements for weight loss contained undeclared synthetic adulterants?",

                "Over 65%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into quality control (Lesson 6) indicates that economic adulteration is significant, with studies consistently showing 25-31% of certain supplement categories containing undeclared substances like sibutramine."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "When calculating the safety margin of a botanical, the 'Therapeutic Index' (TI) is determined by which ratio?",

                "Absorption rate / Excretion rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Therapeutic Index is the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity (LD50) to the dose that produces a clinically desired effect (ED50). A higher TI indicates a safer herb."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A client taking Warfarin (an anticoagulant) begins consuming high doses of Garlic (Allium sativum). This is an example of which type of interaction?",

                "Synergistic interaction increasing Vitamin K synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is a pharmacodynamic interaction because both substances affect the same physiological process (blood clotting) through different mechanisms, leading to an increased risk of bleeding without necessarily changing drug blood levels."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which of the following populations is considered most vulnerable to the hepatotoxic effects of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids (PAs) found in herbs like Comfrey?",
            "options": [
                "Adult males with high muscle mass",

                "Athletes using protein supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infants are highly susceptible to PA-induced veno-occlusive disease because their hepatic detoxification pathways are not fully developed, making even small doses potentially fatal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Naranjo Algorithm is a validated questionnaire used to determine the likelihood that an adverse drug/herb reaction was actually caused by the substance rather than other factors."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "According to the 'Precautionary Principle' in herbal ethics, if the safety of a herb during pregnancy is unknown (Category C), the practitioner should:",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe it at half the standard dose",
                "Prescribe it only if the client requests it",
                "Avoid use until safety is established, as the absence of evidence is not evidence of safety",
                "Assume it is safe if it has been used traditionally for over 100 years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Precautionary Principle dictates that in the absence of scientific consensus or safety data, especially in vulnerable populations, the practitioner should err on the side of caution and avoid the intervention."

                "Increased heart rate from excessive caffeine intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type B reactions are idiosyncratic, meaning they are unpredictable, not related to the known pharmacological action of the herb, and are often related to the individual's unique genetics or immune system."
