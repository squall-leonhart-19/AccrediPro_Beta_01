            "question": "Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme. What is the clinical consequence of this for a client taking a drug metabolized by this pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Increased blood plasma concentration of the drug, leading to toxicity",
                "Decreased blood plasma concentration of the drug, leading to therapeutic failure",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging is associated with a decline in renal and hepatic clearance, meaning herbs and drugs stay in the system longer, increasing the risk of accumulation and toxicity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of <0.05 is generally considered statistically significant, indicating that the probability of the results occurring by random chance is less than 5%."
