            "options": [
                "Potency, Purity, and Price",
                "Ecological Integrity, Social Equity, and Economic Viability",
                "Harvesting, Processing, and Distribution",
                "Wildcrafting, Cultivation, and Importation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Triple Bottom Line (TBL) shifts the focus from purely financial profit to include social equity (people) and ecological integrity (planet), ensuring long-term viability for the herbal industry."

            "question": "A 2021 industry report found that nearly 25% of 'Wildcrafted' herbs lacked verifiable chain-of-custody documentation. What is the primary risk of using unverified wild-harvested Scutellaria lateriflora (Skullcap)?",
            "options": [
                "Reduced flavonoid content due to poor drying",
                "Accidental adulteration with Teucrium species (Germander), which is hepatotoxic",
                "Higher concentrations of lead from roadside harvesting",
                "Loss of volatile oils during long-distance transport"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Skullcap is frequently adulterated with Germander in unverified supply chains. Germander contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can cause severe liver damage, highlighting the importance of supply chain integrity."

            "question": "The United Plant Savers (UpS) 'At-Risk' list includes Hydrastis canadensis (Goldenseal). What is the recommended practitioner action when a client requires its berberine-rich profile?",
            "options": [
                "Only use wild-harvested roots from private land",
                "Increase the dosage to ensure efficacy from smaller roots",
                "Substitute with Coptis chinensis or cultivated Berberis vulgaris to reduce pressure on wild Goldenseal",
                "Use the leaves instead of the root, as they contain 50% more berberine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To protect at-risk species like Goldenseal, practitioners should utilize ecologically stable alternatives (like cultivated Barberry) or ensure they are only purchasing 100% 'Certified Forest Grown' or cultivated sources."

                "Harvesting only 1 plant for every 20 healthy plants of the same species found",
                "Spending 20 minutes scouting for every 1 minute of harvesting",
                "Ensuring 20% of the seeds are replanted immediately",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 1-in-20 rule (5% harvest) is a conservative guideline used for sensitive or slow-growing populations to ensure the reproductive capacity of the stand is not compromised."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prop 65 is one of the strictest standards in the world, setting the limit for lead at 0.5 mcg/day. Many premium practitioners use this as a quality control benchmark for their apothecaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Japanese Knotweed is a highly invasive species in North America and Europe. Utilizing it medicinally helps manage its spread while providing a potent source of resveratrol, reducing the need to harvest more sensitive plants."

            "options": [
                "Eleuthero is more potent for acute stress",
                "Rhodiola is an at-risk species due to over-harvesting in the wild, while Eleuthero is widely and sustainably cultivated",
                "Eleuthero is significantly more expensive, indicating higher quality",
                "Rhodiola has a higher rate of heavy metal accumulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola rosea populations are under significant pressure in their native habitats (Siberia/Scandinavia). Eleuthero provides similar adaptogenic benefits and is much more ecologically sustainable for long-term use."

            "question": "A practitioner notices a 'Mass Balance' claim on a bulk herb supply. What does this indicate about the supply chain?",
            "options": [
                "The herbs were weighed using certified scales",
                "The total volume of sustainable herb purchased matches the volume sold, though the specific batches may have been mixed during processing",
                "The herbs were grown using biodynamic composting methods",
                "The price of the herb is pegged to the global commodity market"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mass Balance is a sourcing model where sustainable and non-sustainable ingredients are mixed, but the company ensures the volume of sustainable product produced matches the volume of sustainable raw material purchased."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Harvesting in late autumn allows the plant to complete its reproductive cycle (dropping seeds) and ensures the highest concentration of active constituents as the plant stores energy for winter."
