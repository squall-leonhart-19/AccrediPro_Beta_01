            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Clinical evidence suggests Ashwagandha acts as a thyroid stimulant, effectively lowering TSH and raising T4, making it useful for subclinical hypothyroidism."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Unlike caffeine, Bacopa's effects on memory and cognitive performance are cumulative; meta-analyses show that significant improvements in memory recall typically require 8-12 weeks of consistent dosing."
