            "question": "When managing a 'Multi-System Client' (L1) with five or more active pathologies, what is the primary clinical priority according to the AccrediPro methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Treating all symptoms simultaneously with a large formula",
                "Identifying the 'Lead Dominant System' that drives the cascade of dysfunction",

                "Immediately starting a deep systemic detoxification protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, practitioners must identify the 'Lead Dominant System' (often the nervous or endocrine system) to avoid overwhelming the client's vitality and to create a strategic sequence of healing."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client presents with sudden onset of 'the worst headache of their life,' coupled with neck stiffness and photophobia. According to Triage Protocols (L2), what is the correct action?",

                "Perform a constitutional assessment to determine the energetic root of the headache"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sudden 'thunderclap' headaches with meningismus (neck stiffness) are red-flag symptoms for life-threatening intracranial events and require immediate emergency medical intervention."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme. In a polypharmacy context (L3), what is the clinical result of this induction?",
            "options": [
                "Increased plasma concentration of the drug, leading to toxicity",
                "Decreased plasma concentration of the drug, leading to therapeutic failure",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Induction of CYP3A4 increases the rate at which the liver metabolizes drugs, which lowers the drug's concentration in the blood, potentially rendering life-saving medications (like anticoagulants or immunosuppressants) ineffective."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scutellaria baicalensis, specifically its constituent baicalin, has been shown in clinical studies to modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, making it a key intervention for acute inflammatory storms."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In Palliative Care (L6), what is the primary distinction between 'Curative Intent' and 'Comfort Care'?",
            "options": [
                "Curative intent uses only herbs; comfort care uses only drugs",
                "Comfort care prioritizes symptom management and quality of life over disease reversal",
                "Curative intent is only for young patients",
                "Comfort care avoids all use of nervines and sedatives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Palliative care shifts the focus from reversing pathology to maximizing comfort, dignity, and quality of life, using herbs to manage pain, secretions, and agitation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A GFR below 30 (Stage 4 CKD) represents a metabolic crisis point where the clearance of herbal metabolites is severely impaired, necessitating the cessation of most non-essential supplements."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "During the 'Post-Crisis Stabilization' phase (L8), what is the danger of using strong 'Stimulant Adaptogens' like Panax ginseng or Eleutherococcus?",
            "options": [
                "They may cause immediate kidney failure",
                "They can 'borrow' energy the body doesn't have, leading to a deeper 'crash' or relapse",
                "They are too expensive for the recovery phase",
                "They prevent the absorption of vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the immediate recovery phase, the body is 'metabolically brittle.' Stimulant adaptogens can over-tax the HPA axis; gentle trophorestoratives are preferred to rebuild 'deep reserves' first."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Which term describes the clinical phenomenon where a new medication is prescribed to 'treat' the side effects of a previous medication, common in complex elderly cases (L3)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Prescribing Cascade' is a major risk in complex cases where side effects are misidentified as new medical conditions, leading to further polypharmacy and increased risk of Herb-Drug Interactions."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In a case study from Lesson 4 involving an 'Immune Storm,' what was the observed effect of using high-dose Sambucus (Elderberry) *during* the peak of a cytokine release syndrome?",
            "options": [
                "It immediately cured the patient",
                "It had no effect whatsoever",
                "It potentially exacerbated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) if not balanced with modulators",
                "It acted as a potent anticoagulant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Elderberry is excellent for prevention/early stage, some data suggests it can increase pro-inflammatory cytokines; in a 'storm' scenario, practitioners must use 'modulators' (like Scutellaria) rather than 'stimulants'."
