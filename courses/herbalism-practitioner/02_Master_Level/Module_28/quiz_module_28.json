            "question": "In the context of L1, which clinical marker is the most significant indicator of 'Allostatic Load' in a multi-system complex client?",
            "options": [
                "Single-organ pathology reports",
                "The cumulative wear and tear on the body's systems from chronic over-activation of adaptive responses",
                "Acute-phase reactant levels (e.g., CRP) during a single viral infection",
                "A client's subjective report of stress levels over a 24-hour period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the cumulative physiological toll on the body resulting from chronic exposure to fluctuating or heightened neural or neuroendocrine responses to stress. In complex cases, we look at the synergy of multiple systems failing to return to homeostasis."

            "question": "According to Lesson 2 (Triage), which of the following 'Red Flag' symptoms requires immediate cessation of a consultation and referral to Emergency Services (911/A&E)?",
            "options": [
                "A mild skin rash following the introduction of a new herbal tea",
                "Chronic fatigue that has worsened over the last three months",
                "A 'Thunderclap' headache described as the worst pain of the client's life",
                "Occasional heart palpitations associated with caffeine consumption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Thunderclap' headache is a classic red flag for subarachnoid hemorrhage or other life-threatening neurological events. Herbalists must triage these cases immediately as they are outside the scope of herbal practice."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, polypharmacy is defined as the concurrent use of 5 or more medications. What is the primary pharmacokinetic concern when a client is taking a 'Narrow Therapeutic Index' (NTI) drug like Warfarin alongside St. John's Wort?",
            "options": [
                "St. John's Wort inhibits CYP3A4, leading to toxic levels of Warfarin",
                "St. John's Wort induces CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, potentially lowering Warfarin's efficacy and increasing clot risk",
                "The herbs increase the absorption of Warfarin in the small intestine",
                "There is no interaction between St. John's Wort and Warfarin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (specifically CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein. This speeds up the metabolism of NTI drugs, reducing their plasma concentration to sub-therapeutic levels."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "During an acute 'Immune Storm' (Lesson 4), which mechanism of action makes Scutellaria baicalensis (Baical Skullcap) a preferred intervention over Echinacea species?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6",
                "It acts as a potent immunostimulant to increase white blood cell count",
                "It inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome and downregulates the cytokine storm without overstimulating the immune system",
                "It is a purely nutritive herb with no effect on the inflammatory cascade"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In an immune storm (hyper-inflammation), we avoid immunostimulants. Scutellaria baicalensis contains baicalin, which has been shown in studies to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, helping to modulate and dampen the excessive cytokine response."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A client presents in an acute psychological crisis (Panic Attack) in your office. Based on Lesson 5 (Nervous System First Aid), which herbal delivery method is most appropriate for immediate 'grounding'?",
            "options": [
                "A standard infusion (tea) to be sipped over 30 minutes",
                "A low-dose drop-dosage of a fresh plant tincture (e.g., Pulsatilla or Avena) placed directly on the tongue or in a small sip of water",
                "A 4-week course of encapsulated dried valerian root",
                "A high-dose decoction of adaptogenic roots"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute emotional crisis, 'drop-dosage' or low-dose liquid extracts provide a sensory 'anchor' and rapid absorption. This allows for immediate energetic and physiological shifts compared to capsules or slow-sipped teas."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In Palliative Care (Lesson 6), what is the primary goal of using 'Terminal Nervines' like Eschscholzia californica (California Poppy) or Lactuca virosa (Wild Lettuce)?",
            "options": [
                "To reverse the underlying terminal disease pathology",
                "To provide aggressive detoxification of the liver",
                "To manage 'Terminal Agitation' and provide comfort by easing dyspnea and anxiety",
                "To increase the client's appetite and caloric intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In palliative care, the focus shifts from cure to comfort. Terminal nervines help manage the distress, anxiety, and restlessness (agitation) often seen in the final stages of life."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, which clinical value must be monitored before administering high-tannin or alkaloid-heavy herbs to a client in a metabolic crisis involving the kidneys?",
            "options": [
                "Blood Glucose levels",
                "Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and Creatinine",
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Vitamin D levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The eGFR and Creatinine levels indicate renal function. In metabolic crisis or renal failure, the kidneys cannot clear certain herbal constituents, which can lead to toxicity. Monitoring these is vital for safety."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "During the 'Recovery Phase' (Lesson 8), why is the use of 'Trophorestoratives' like Urtica dioica seed (Nettle Seed) or Avena sativa (Milky Oats) prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "To induce a strong laxative effect to clear medications",
                "To provide deep tissue nourishment and restore function to exhausted organs (e.g., the adrenals or kidneys) post-crisis",
                "To suppress the immune system to prevent further attacks",
                "To act as a stimulant to force the client back to work immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trophorestoratives are herbs that nourish and restore the function of specific organs or systems that have been depleted by chronic stress or acute crisis. Nettle seed is specifically valued for renal trophorestoration."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 72-year-old client on Digoxin (for heart failure) and Furosemide (a diuretic) wants to take Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) for a cough. Why is this a 'Complex Case' risk?",
            "options": [
                "Licorice will make the Digoxin taste better",
                "Licorice can cause potassium depletion (hypokalemia), which significantly increases the risk of Digoxin toxicity",
                "Licorice will neutralize the effects of the diuretic, causing weight loss",
                "There is no risk; Licorice is safe for all cardiac patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licorice (containing glycyrrhizin) can cause potassium loss. Furosemide also causes potassium loss. Low potassium (hypokalemia) sensitizes the myocardium to Digoxin, potentially leading to fatal cardiac arrhythmias."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A 2020 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that what percentage of patients using herbal supplements concurrently with prescription medications are at risk of a clinically significant Herb-Drug Interaction (HDI)?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 25-30%",
                "100% of all patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly 1 in 4 to 1 in 3 (25-30%) patients using herbs alongside pharmaceuticals are at risk of interactions, highlighting the need for rigorous screening in complex cases."
