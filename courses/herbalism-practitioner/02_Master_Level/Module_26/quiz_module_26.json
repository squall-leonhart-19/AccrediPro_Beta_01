        {
            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "In the ROOTS Staging Method, which phase focuses specifically on supporting the primary channels of elimination (liver, kidneys, bowel) before introducing deep tonics?",
            "options": ["Relief", "Opening", "Optimizing", "Sustaining"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Opening' phase (the first O in ROOTS) is dedicated to ensuring elimination channels are patent and functioning correctly to prevent 'healing crises' or stagnation when metabolic waste is mobilized."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Strategic Client Intake' framework (L1), what is the primary benefit of establishing a 'Goal Architecture' during the first session?",
            "options": ["It allows the practitioner to charge higher fees", "It creates a 12-month fixed protocol that cannot be changed", "It establishes measurable benchmarks to track efficacy and maintain client motivation", "It replaces the need for a physical assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Goal Architecture transforms vague desires into measurable benchmarks, allowing both the practitioner and client to see objective progress, which is critical for long-term clinical success."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "When designing a formula for 'Advanced Synergy' (L3), what is the recommended percentage range for 'Catalyst' herbs that enhance the delivery or activity of the primary herbs?",
            "options": ["50-70%", "30-45%", "10-20%", "1-5%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In advanced formulation, the 'Catalyst' or 'Messenger' herbs typically comprise 10-20% of the formula, providing enough potency to direct the action without overwhelming the primary therapeutic goals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Damp-Heat' energetics (L4) characterized by inflammatory skin conditions and yellow tongue coating. Which formulation strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": ["Warm and Pungent herbs to move stagnation", "Bitter and Cold herbs to clear heat and drain dampness", "Sweet and Tonic herbs to build Qi", "Salty and Cold herbs to soften hardness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traditional energetics require a 'contraria contrariis' approach; Damp-Heat is best addressed with herbs that are Bitter (to drain/dry) and Cold (to clear heat), such as Berberis vulgaris."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "Research into behavioral psychology (L5) suggests that client compliance drops significantly when a protocol exceeds how many daily 'actions' or doses?",
            "options": ["2 actions", "3 actions", "5 actions", "7 actions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows a 'compliance cliff' where adherence drops by nearly 40% when a protocol moves from 2 daily actions to 3 or more, emphasizing the need for simplified dosing schedules."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In the 'Evaluation and Data-Driven Adjustment' phase (L6), what is the 'Rule of Three' regarding protocol changes?",
            "options": ["Wait three days before changing a formula", "Change three ingredients at every follow-up", "Observe a protocol for at least three metabolic cycles (approx. 90 days) for chronic issues before major overhauls", "Only use three herbs per formula"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For chronic conditions, the Rule of Three suggests allowing roughly 90 days (three 30-day cycles) to observe systemic shifts before concluding a protocol is ineffective, unless acute sensitivities occur."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "Which organization provides the 'Red List' of threatened species that herbalists must consult to ensure Ethical Sourcing (L7)?",
            "options": ["WHO", "IUCN", "FDA", "UNESCO"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List is the global standard for identifying species at risk of extinction, which is vital for sustainable herbal practice management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In Advanced Case Management (L8), what is the defining characteristic of a 'Dual Relationship'?",
            "options": ["Treating two clients from the same family", "Using two different herbal traditions in one formula", "When a practitioner has a professional and another significant personal/business relationship with a client", "Consulting with two different doctors about one case"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A dual relationship occurs when a practitioner holds more than one role in a client's life (e.g., friend and therapist), which can complicate professional boundaries and ethical decision-making."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A client has successfully completed the 'Relief' and 'Opening' phases but experiences a plateau in the 'Optimizing' phase. What is the most likely clinical adjustment needed (L3/L6)?",
            "options": ["Return to the Relief phase indefinitely", "Assess for 'Sub-clinical Stagnation' and introduce a circulatory stimulant or catalyst", "Increase the dose of the primary tonic by 300%", "Stop all herbs for 30 days"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plateaus in the Optimizing phase often indicate that the primary herbs aren't reaching the target tissues effectively; introducing a circulatory stimulant (catalyst) can 'break' the stagnation and restart progress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Which metric is considered the most reliable 'Subjective Data' point for monitoring long-term protocol success in a clinical herbal setting?",
            "options": ["The client's verbal 'feeling' on the day of the visit", "A validated Symptom Burden Scale (0-10) tracked over multiple sessions", "The color of the herbal tincture", "The practitioner's intuition alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'feelings' are important, a standardized Symptom Burden Scale provides quantifiable subjective data that can be graphed over time to show trends, reducing the impact of 'recency bias' in client reporting."
