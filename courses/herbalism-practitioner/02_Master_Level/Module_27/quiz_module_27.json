                "A 1.43 relative risk for 12-month survival compared to chemotherapy alone",
                "A total elimination of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy",
                "Complete inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme pathway",
                "No significant difference in survival rates but improved appetite"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Astragalus has been shown in large meta-analyses to significantly improve survival rates and reduce toxicity when used as supportive care alongside platinum-based chemotherapy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) acts as a true immunomodulator, helping to suppress the Th17 inflammatory response while supporting T-regulatory cell function."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Using Clark's Rule for pediatric dosing, if an adult dose of a tincture is 5mL and the child weighs 30 lbs, what is the appropriate pediatric dose?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clark's Rule: (Weight in lbs / 150) x Adult Dose. (30 / 150) = 0.2. 0.2 x 5mL = 1.0 mL."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In geriatric care, why is the induction of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter by St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) particularly dangerous for patients on Digoxin?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the absorption of Digoxin to toxic levels",
                "It causes Digoxin to cross the blood-brain barrier",
                "It increases the efflux of the drug, leading to sub-therapeutic blood levels and heart failure risk",
                "It converts Digoxin into an inactive metabolite in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort induces P-gp, which pumps drugs out of cells. For Digoxin, this results in lower plasma concentrations, potentially rendering the medication ineffective."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A 32-year-old female client presents with infertility associated with latent hyperprolactinemia. Which mechanism of Vitex agnus-castus makes it the primary choice for this case?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitex contains diterpenes that bind to dopamine D2 receptors in the pituitary, inhibiting the overproduction of prolactin, which helps normalize the luteal phase."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In Clinical Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), a 2019 study on Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) demonstrated that a 60-day protocol resulted in what average reduction in morning cortisol levels?",

                "It acts as a topical antibiotic to kill C. acnes",
                "It is a 'blood purifier' (alterative) that supports the skin-liver-kidney axis of elimination",

                "It increases sebum production to prevent skin cracking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Burdock is a classic alterative used to improve metabolic waste elimination via the liver and kidneys, which reduces the 'burden' on the skin as an eliminatory organ."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In palliative care, which botanical intervention has been shown in clinical trials to be as effective as trolamine for preventing Grade 2 or higher radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients?",

            "options": [
                "By increasing testosterone levels",
                "By reducing insulin resistance and improving glucose uptake",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In PCOS, hyperinsulinemia drives excess androgen production. Cinnamon improves insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps lower androgens and restore regular ovulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The prescribing cascade occurs when side effects of drugs are misdiagnosed as new symptoms, leading to further prescriptions. Herbalists must be aware of this to avoid adding more 'fuel' to the polypharmacy fire."
