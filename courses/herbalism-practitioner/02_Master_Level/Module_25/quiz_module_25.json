            "question": "According to Proctor’s Three-Function Model of Supervision, which function focuses on the practitioner's emotional well-being and the management of 'burnout'?",
            "options": ["The Normative Function", "The Formative Function", "The Restorative Function", "The Evaluative Function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative (or supportive) function is dedicated to the emotional impact of the work, helping practitioners manage stress, prevent burnout, and maintain resilience."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "In the context of the Developmental Model (Stoltenberg & Delworth), a 'Level 1' supervisee typically exhibits which of the following characteristics?",
            "options": ["High autonomy and stable professional identity", "High motivation but high anxiety and a need for clear structure", "Fluctuating motivation and a focus on the supervisor's shortcomings", "Integration of personal style with clinical evidence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Level 1 supervisees are usually beginners who are highly motivated but experience significant anxiety and require structured guidance and specific 'how-to' instructions."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "What legal concept holds a supervisor potentially liable for the negligent actions of their supervisee, even if the supervisor did not directly cause the harm?",
            "options": ["Concurrent Negligence", "Vicarious Liability (Respondeat Superior)", "Sovereign Immunity", "Strict Liability"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious liability means the supervisor can be held responsible for the supervisee's clinical errors if they occurred within the scope of the supervised relationship."

            "options": ["The client's internal world", "The practitioner's interventions", "The parallel process (the relationship between supervisor and supervisee)", "The wider organizational or social context"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mode 5 focuses on the 'Parallel Process,' where the dynamics occurring between the client and practitioner are unconsciously mirrored in the relationship between the practitioner and supervisor."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on clinical feedback (n=1,240) suggested that the most effective feedback for skill acquisition follows which ratio of positive to corrective comments?",
            "options": ["1:1 ratio", "3:1 ratio (The Losada Ratio principle)", "10:1 ratio", "Corrective comments only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a 'high-support, high-challenge' environment is best maintained with a ratio of approximately 3 positive reinforcements for every 1 corrective critique to ensure the supervisee remains receptive."

            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "During a case review, a practitioner expresses intense frustration with a client who 'refuses to follow the protocol.' The supervisor notices the practitioner is reacting similarly to how the client’s parent might. This is an example of:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-transference occurs when the practitioner’s own emotional history or reactions are projected onto the client, often triggered by the client’s behavior (transference)."

            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "In 'Pendleton’s Rules' for feedback, what is the first step in the process?",
            "options": ["The supervisor states what was done well", "The supervisee states what they think they did well", "The supervisor identifies areas for improvement", "The supervisee identifies what they would do differently"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendleton's Rules require the supervisee to first identify their own strengths before receiving external feedback, which encourages self-reflection and reduces defensiveness."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "Which group supervision format is specifically designed to explore the 'psychological climate' of the practitioner-patient relationship through a structured, peer-led case presentation?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Balint Groups are a specialized form of group supervision that focuses on the emotional and relational aspects of the clinician-patient dynamic rather than just clinical facts."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Normative function is about quality control, ethics, and safety. In HDI cases, the supervisor must ensure the practitioner is adhering to professional safety standards and evidence-based practice."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Kolb’s cycle, after a practitioner has a clinical experience (Concrete Experience), they must engage in Reflective Observation (thinking about the experience) before forming theories (Abstract Conceptualization)."
