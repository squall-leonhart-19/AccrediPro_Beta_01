            "question": "When calculating a pediatric dose using Clark’s Rule, which primary variable is used to determine the proportion of the adult dose?",
            "options": [
                "The child’s age in years",
                "The child’s age in months",
                "The child’s weight in pounds",
                "The child’s body surface area (BSA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clark’s Rule calculates the pediatric dose by dividing the child's weight in pounds by 150 and multiplying by the adult dose. Age-based rules like Young’s Rule are generally considered less accurate than weight-based calculations."

            "question": "In geriatric care, why is the 'start low and go slow' approach clinically necessary regarding pharmacokinetics?",
            "options": [
                "Increased total body water increases the concentration of water-soluble herbs.",
                "Reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) slows the excretion of herbal metabolites.",
                "Increased hepatic blood flow accelerates the first-pass metabolism.",
                "Reduced body fat decreases the half-life of lipophilic constituents."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging is associated with a physiological decline in renal function (reduced GFR) and hepatic clearance. This increases the risk of constituent accumulation and toxicity, making lower initial doses safer for elderly clients."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which mechanism of action explains the use of Vitex agnus-castus in supporting female fertility during the preconception phase?",
            "options": [
                "It contains high levels of phytoestrogens that stimulate the uterine lining.",
                "It acts as a direct precursor to progesterone in the adrenal glands.",
                "It modulates the pituitary gland to inhibit prolactin and support the luteal phase.",
                "It induces acute ovulation by mimicking the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitex is a dopaminergic herb that inhibits excessive prolactin secretion and supports the production of LH, which in turn promotes progesterone production during the luteal phase, essential for implantation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red Raspberry Leaf is a traditional uterine tonic rich in vitamins and minerals. The other options contain alkaloids or volatile oils (like thujone) that are contraindicated in pregnancy due to abortifacient or neurotoxic risks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Black Cohosh is one of the most well-researched herbs for menopause; clinical data consistently shows its efficacy in reducing vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) via selective estrogen receptor modulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saw Palmetto works by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone into the more potent DHT, which is a primary driver of prostate tissue enlargement."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of palliative herbalism is comfort, dignity, and symptom relief (such as managing nausea, anxiety, or dry mouth). Attempting to 'cure' terminal illness or removing necessary palliative pharmaceuticals is outside the scope of practice and ethically unsound."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 40% of older adults take five or more medications. This high prevalence of polypharmacy is a critical factor for herbalists to consider due to the increased risk of herb-drug interactions."
