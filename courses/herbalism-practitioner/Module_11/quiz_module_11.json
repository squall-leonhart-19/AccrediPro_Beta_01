            "question": "In the context of Immunology Fundamentals (L1), how does the 'Innate' immune system differ primarily from the 'Adaptive' immune system?",
            "options": [
                "The innate system provides a rapid, non-specific response, while the adaptive system creates specific memory cells.",
                "The innate system is only found in the gut, while the adaptive system is found in the blood.",
                "The adaptive system responds within minutes, whereas the innate system takes days to activate.",
                "The innate system is comprised solely of T-cells, while the adaptive system uses B-cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The innate immune system is the first line of defense, providing immediate but non-specific protection. The adaptive system is slower to respond initially but develops highly specific memory for future encounters."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Which physiological mechanism is most critical for the movement of lymph fluid, given that the lymphatic system lacks a central pump like the heart?",
            "options": [
                "Hepatic filtration rates",
                "Skeletal muscle contraction and deep diaphragmatic breathing",
                "High arterial blood pressure",
                "The secretion of bile into the duodenum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lymphatic flow is passive and relies on the 'muscle pump' of physical movement and the pressure changes created by deep breathing to move fluid through the vessels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the primary clinical distinction between an 'Immunostimulant' (e.g., Echinacea) and an 'Immunomodulator' (e.g., Reishi)?",
            "options": [
                "Immunostimulants are used for long-term tonification, while modulators are for acute infections.",
                "Immunostimulants suppress the immune system, while modulators activate it.",
                "Immunostimulants provoke a short-term increase in activity (phagocytosis), while modulators balance and optimize immune function over time.",
                "There is no clinical difference; the terms are interchangeable in professional herbalism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Immunostimulants like Echinacea provide a 'nudge' to the system for acute needs, whereas modulators (often containing complex polysaccharides) work to normalize immune responses, making them safer for long-term use."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Specific research on Sambucus nigra (Elderberry) suggests its antiviral efficacy is largely due to which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Directly dissolving the bacterial cell wall",
                "Binding to viral hemagglutinin spikes to prevent cellular entry",
                "Increasing the acidity of the blood to kill viruses",
                "Acting as a sedative to the nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elderberry flavonoids, particularly anthocyanins, have been shown to bind to the viral spikes, effectively 'locking' the virus out of the host cell and preventing replication."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When addressing Autoimmunity (L5), why is the 'Constitutional Approach' preferred over simple immune suppression?",
            "options": [
                "Suppression is always toxic to the liver.",
                "Herbalists are legally prohibited from using the word 'suppression'.",
                "The goal is to improve T-regulatory cell function and resolve the underlying 'leaky' barriers or inflammatory triggers.",
                "Autoimmune conditions are caused by a lack of Vitamin C, which suppression doesn't fix."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In autoimmunity, the immune system is misdirected, not necessarily 'too strong.' A constitutional approach focuses on T-reg cell modulation and fixing the integrity of the gut and skin barriers."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "What percentage of the body's total immune cells are estimated to reside within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), as discussed in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 30-40%",

                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The majority of the immune system (70-80%) is located in the gut, highlighting the critical link between the microbiome and systemic immunity."

            "options": [
                "In high doses only when a fever is present",
                "Consistently over a period of 4-8 weeks to build 'Wei Qi' and marrow reserve",

                "Only topically as a poultice over the lymph nodes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep immune tonics are restorative and require consistent, long-term use to influence the production of white blood cells and build constitutional resilience."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'boggy' or swollen lymph nodes in the neck that are painless and slow to drain. Which 'lymphagogue' herb is most classically indicated for this specific presentation?",
            "options": [
                "Galium aparine (Cleavers)",
                "Zingiber officinale (Ginger)",

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, when formulating for 'Seasonal Resilience,' why is it recommended to include a carminative herb (like Ginger) alongside immune polysaccharides?",
            "options": [
                "To make the formula taste better for children.",
                "To increase peripheral circulation and enhance the absorption of the larger polysaccharide molecules.",
                "To prevent the immune herbs from becoming toxic.",
                "Carminatives are the only herbs that can kill viruses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Carminatives and circulatory stimulants like Ginger improve 'uptake' and ensure the active constituents are distributed effectively throughout the body's tissues."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "During the 'Convalescence' phase of an illness (L7), what is the primary goal of the herbalist?",
            "options": [
                "To induce a heavy sweat (diaphoretic therapy)",
                "To strictly limit caloric intake to 'starve the remaining virus'",
                "To nourish depleted tissues and support the HPA axis to prevent post-viral fatigue",
                "To use the strongest antibacterial herbs available to ensure no bacteria survived"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Convalescence is about rebuilding. The focus shifts from 'fighting' to 'nourishing' (using adaptogens and nutritive tonics) to ensure the client returns to full vitality and avoids chronic fatigue."
