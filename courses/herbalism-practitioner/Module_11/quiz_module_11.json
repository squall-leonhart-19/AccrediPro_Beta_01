        {
            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which component of the immune system provides a rapid, non-specific response to pathogens and includes physical barriers like the skin and chemical signals like cytokines?",
            "options": [
                "Adaptive Immune System",
                "Innate Immune System",
                "Humoral Immunity",
                "Cell-Mediated Immunity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense, providing immediate but non-specific protection, whereas the adaptive system is slower but creates immunological memory."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system lacks a central pump. What is the primary mechanism for moving lymph fluid through the vessels?",
            "options": [
                "Cardiac output and arterial pressure",
                "Osmotic pressure from the kidneys",
                "Skeletal muscle contraction and deep diaphragmatic breathing",
                "Passive diffusion through the skin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lymphatic flow is dependent on external pressure from skeletal muscle movement and the pressure changes created by deep breathing (the thoracic pump)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "An 'immunomodulator' like Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) differs from an 'immunostimulant' because it:",
            "options": [
                "Only increases the production of white blood cells",
                "Suppresses the immune system entirely to prevent allergies",
                "Balances immune activity, down-regulating overactivity and up-regulating underactivity",
                "Is only effective when taken during the first 24 hours of an infection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Immunomodulators, often containing polysaccharides or beta-glucans, seek to normalize or 'tune' the immune response rather than simply forcing an increase in activity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "According to clinical studies on Sambucus nigra (Elderberry), what is the primary mechanism by which it inhibits viral replication?",
            "options": [
                "It dissolves the lipid envelope of all bacteria",
                "It binds to viral hemagglutinin spikes, preventing the virus from entering host cells",
                "It acts as a systemic antibiotic by inhibiting protein synthesis",
                "It increases body temperature to 103°F to kill viruses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elderberry flavonoids bind to the viral hemagglutinin spikes, effectively 'disarming' the virus and preventing it from penetrating the cell membrane."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When working with a client with a confirmed autoimmune condition (e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis), which herbal category is generally approached with the most caution during an acute flare-up?",
            "options": [
                "Nervine Relaxants",
                "Strong Immunostimulants (e.g., Echinacea in high doses)",
                "Deep Immune Tonics (e.g., Astragalus)",
                "Nutritive Alteratives (e.g., Nettle leaf)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strong immunostimulants can potentially exacerbate the overactive immune response during an autoimmune flare; immunomodulators are typically preferred for long-term management."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's immune cells are located in the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "30-40%",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut, highlighting the critical connection between the microbiome and systemic immunity."

                "Only when a client is taking immunosuppressant drugs",
                "As a preventative tonic to build 'Wei Qi' during periods of health",
                "To stop an allergic reaction in progress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Astragalus is a deep immune tonic used to build resilience and prevent illness; traditional Chinese medicine advises against its use during acute, 'excess' heat conditions like high fevers."

            "id": "q11_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Calendula is a classic lymphatic herb used to move stagnant lymph, support drainage, and clear metabolic waste from the tissues."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "During the 'Convalescence' phase (recovery after a long illness), what is the primary goal of the herbalist?",
            "options": [
                "To continue using high-dose antivirals to ensure the virus is gone",
                "To use trophorestoratives and nutritive tonics to restore depleted vital reserves",
                "To induce heavy sweating (diaphoresis) to clear remaining toxins",
                "To restrict caloric intake to 'starve' any remaining pathogens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Convalescence focuses on rebuilding the body's strength and nutrient stores (vitality) after the immune system has exhausted its resources fighting an infection."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'seasonal resilience' concerns. They get every cold that goes around. A 2021 meta-analysis suggests that which protocol is most effective for reducing the duration of respiratory infections?",
            "options": [
                "Taking Vitamin C only after symptoms disappear",
                "Combining Echinacea with early intervention at the first sign of a 'tickle' in the throat",
                "Using only topical essential oils without internal herbs",
                "Strict bed rest without any herbal intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that immunostimulants like Echinacea are most effective when started immediately at the onset of symptoms, rather than waiting until the infection is fully established."
