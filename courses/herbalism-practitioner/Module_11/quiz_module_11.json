            "question": "Which specific class of phytochemicals found in Symphytum officinale (Comfrey) and Senecio species is known to cause hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) through the formation of reactive pyrroles?",
            "options": [
                "Triterpene saponins",
                "Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs)",
                "Anthraquinone glycosides",
                "Furanocoumarins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are potent hepatotoxins. When metabolized by the liver, they form reactive pyrroles that damage the vascular endothelium of the liver, leading to hepatic veno-occlusive disease."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client taking St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) alongside the immunosuppressant Cyclosporine experiences a 50% drop in the drug's plasma concentration. This is an example of which pharmacokinetic mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibition of the CYP2D6 enzyme",
                "Induction of the CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)",
                "Competitive inhibition of renal clearance",
                "Physicochemical complexation in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme and the P-gp efflux pump. This increases the rate of drug metabolism and elimination, significantly lowering the therapeutic levels of drugs like Cyclosporine, Warfarin, and oral contraceptives."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In the context of pharmacodynamics, if a practitioner prescribes Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) to a client already taking a benzodiazepine, what is the most likely clinical outcome?",
            "options": [
                "The Valerian will neutralize the effects of the drug.",
                "The drug will prevent the Valerian from binding to receptors.",
                "An additive or synergistic sedative effect, increasing the risk of CNS depression.",
                "The Valerian will increase the rate of drug excretion through the kidneys."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a pharmacodynamic interaction where both substances act on the same physiological system (GABA receptors). The combined effect is additive, potentially leading to excessive sedation or respiratory depression."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which botanical is strictly contraindicated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to its historical association with 'Chinese Herbs Nephropathy' and irreversible interstitial fibrosis?",

                "Taraxacum officinale (Dandelion leaf)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Aristolochic acid is a potent nephrotoxin and carcinogen. It causes rapid, progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis and is strictly banned in most countries due to its high toxicity to the renal system."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2006, within what timeframe must 'Serious Adverse Events' (SAEs) be reported to the FDA via the MedWatch system?",

                "30 calendar days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Federal law requires that serious adverse events (resulting in death, hospitalization, or significant disability) related to dietary supplements be reported to the FDA within 15 business days."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While limits vary by jurisdiction, the USP <2232> standard for dietary supplements sets a limit of 5 mcg per day for lead exposure to ensure consumer safety against chronic heavy metal toxicity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DSHEA allows for 'Structure/Function' claims (e.g., 'supports healthy...') but prohibits 'Disease Claims' (e.g., treats, cures, or prevents a specific named disease)."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A client with atrial fibrillation is taking Warfarin (INR target 2.0-3.0). They begin taking high doses of Garlic (Allium sativum) and Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba). What is the primary clinical concern for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of blood clots due to herb-drug antagonism",
                "Increased risk of spontaneous hemorrhage due to additive anti-platelet effects",

                "Vitamin K toxicity from the herbal supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Both Garlic and Ginkgo possess anti-platelet properties. When combined with an anticoagulant like Warfarin, they can increase the risk of bleeding (hemorrhage) even if the INR remains within the therapeutic range."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "The 'Grapefruit Juice Effect' is a classic example of enzyme inhibition. Which enzyme is primarily inhibited in the intestinal wall, leading to increased bioavailability of drugs like Simvastatin?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Furanocoumarins in grapefruit juice inhibit intestinal CYP3A4. This prevents the 'first-pass metabolism' of certain drugs, allowing significantly higher concentrations to enter the bloodstream, which can lead to toxicity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The priority is client safety. If an adverse event is suspected, the practitioner must 'First, do no harm' by suspending the protocol, assessing the symptoms, and documenting the event to determine if a causal link exists."
