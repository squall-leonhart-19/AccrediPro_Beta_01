            "question": "In the context of 'The Science of Synergy' (L1), what is the defining characteristic of pharmacokinetic synergy compared to pharmacodynamic synergy?",
            "options": [
                "Pharmacokinetic synergy involves one herb altering the absorption, distribution, or metabolism of another.",
                "Pharmacokinetic synergy occurs when two herbs bind to the same receptor site to increase potency.",
                "Pharmacodynamic synergy refers specifically to the taste-based energetic shifts in the body.",
                "Pharmacokinetic synergy only occurs in aqueous delivery systems like decoctions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pharmacokinetic synergy (PK) deals with how the body processes the herbs (ADME: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), while pharmacodynamic synergy (PD) deals with the herb's effect on the body's receptors or physiological targets."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the Tripartite Structure (L2), which role is primarily responsible for moderating the toxicity of the 'King' herb or addressing secondary symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "The Chief (King)",
                "The Deputy (Minister)",
                "The Assistant (Assistant)",
                "The Envoy (Messenger)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Assistant herb (sometimes called the Adjuvant) has three roles: reinforcing the King/Minister, moderating harsh properties/toxicity, or treating secondary symptoms."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Using the 'Dosage Mathematics' (L3) protocols, if you are creating a 1:4 tincture using 125g of dried herb, what is the total volume of menstruum required?",
            "options": [
                "250ml",
                "400ml",
                "500ml",
                "625ml"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a 1:4 ratio, for every 1 part herb (weight), you use 4 parts menstruum (volume). 125g x 4 = 500ml."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Tension/Constriction' tissue states (L4), characterized by spasms, nervousness, and a wiry pulse. Which combination of energetics and tastes is most indicated?",
            "options": [
                "Relaxant/Antispasmodic and Acrid/Pungent tastes",
                "Astringent/Tonic and Sour tastes",
                "Bitter/Cooling and Purgative tastes",
                "Demulcent/Moisturizing and Sweet tastes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Tension/Constriction state requires relaxants. Acrid and Pungent herbs (like Valerian or Lobelia) are traditionally used to 'break' the tension and move stagnant energy."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 5 regarding Delivery Systems, why might a practitioner choose a 'Glycerite' over an 'Ethanol Tincture' for a formula containing high amounts of tannins?",
            "options": [
                "Glycerine is a superior solvent for alkaloids compared to ethanol.",
                "Glycerine prevents the precipitation of tannins over time, maintaining formula stability.",
                "Glycerine increases the heat of the formula, aiding in digestion.",
                "Ethanol completely destroys the therapeutic value of tannins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycerine is often added to high-tannin tinctures (as a stabilizer) because it prevents tannins from precipitating out of the solution during storage."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "In the study of 'The Five Tastes' (L6), the 'Bitter' taste triggers the release of Cholecystokinin (CCK). What is the primary clinical outcome of this mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate increase in blood glucose levels.",
                "Stimulation of bile secretion and the 'Cephalic Phase' of digestion.",

                "Rapid sedation of the central nervous system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bitters stimulate the bitter receptors (T2Rs) on the tongue, triggering the vagus nerve and the release of digestive hormones like CCK, which stimulates bile and enzyme production."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "During the 'Safety Protocols' (L7) assessment, you identify a client taking Warfarin. Which herb-drug interaction represents the highest risk of 'Pharmacodynamic Potentiation'?",
            "options": [
                "Matricaria chamomilla (Chamomile) due to mild sedation.",
                "Salix alba (White Willow) due to additive antiplatelet effects.",
                "Silybum marianum (Milk Thistle) due to liver enzyme induction.",
                "Mentha piperita (Peppermint) due to esophageal sphincter relaxation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "White Willow contains salicylates which, when combined with anticoagulants like Warfarin, significantly increase the risk of spontaneous bleeding (an additive pharmacodynamic effect)."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In a 2022 clinical trial (referenced in L1), the combination of Berberine with Quercetin showed a 32% increase in Berberine's plasma concentration compared to Berberine alone. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "The 'Entourage Effect' via P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition.",
                "Antagonistic interaction reducing toxicity.",
                "Chemical degradation of the Berberine molecule.",
                "Sensory synergy via the Pungent taste."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quercetin acts as a 'Minister' herb by inhibiting P-gp efflux pumps, which would otherwise pump Berberine out of the cell, thereby increasing its bioavailability."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When 'Formulating for Tissue States' (L4), which herb would be the most appropriate 'King' for a 'Damp Relaxation' (tissue prolapse, leaking fluids) presentation?",
            "options": [
                "Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow) - Moistening",
                "Quercus alba (White Oak) - Astringent",

                "Zingiber officinale (Ginger) - Warming"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Damp Relaxation involves a loss of tone and excessive fluid leakage. Astringents like White Oak (rich in tannins) 'knit' the tissues back together and increase tone."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "In the 'Formulation Workshop' (L8), what is the final step before compounding the physical medicine?",
            "options": [
                "Determining the energetic temperature of the client.",
                "Calculating the specific milliliters (ml) for each herb based on the percentage ratio.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "After the intake, assessment, and strategy (selecting herbs and roles), the practitioner must translate the theoretical ratios (e.g., 40% King, 30% Minister) into actual volumes (ml) for compounding."
