            "question": "Unlike primary metabolites, plant secondary metabolites are primarily produced for which of the following purposes?",
            "options": [
                "Basic cellular structure and growth",
                "Photosynthesis and energy storage",

            "question": "Which structural feature of flavonoids is primarily responsible for their potent antioxidant capacity?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flavonoids contain multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups on their phenolic rings, allowing them to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) by donating hydrogen atoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alkaloids (like morphine or caffeine) are highly potent and often have a narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between a therapeutic and toxic dose is small."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium, which increases the force of myocardial contraction."

            "question": "When formulating for a client with 'leaky gut' or inflamed mucosal membranes, which constituent group provides a physical protective barrier through its polysaccharide structure?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synergy occurs when 'minor' constituents enhance the absorption, stabilize the molecule, or mitigate side effects of the 'major' active constituent."
