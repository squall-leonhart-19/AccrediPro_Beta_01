            "question": "In the context of energetic herbalism, how is 'Constitution' distinguished from 'Condition'?",
            "options": [
                "Constitution is the current acute symptom, while Condition is the genetic history.",
                "Constitution is the individual's inherent baseline and tendencies, while Condition is the current state of imbalance.",
                "Constitution refers only to physical height and weight, while Condition refers to emotional state.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms describe the same physiological state in practitioner assessment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Constitution represents the underlying energetic blueprint and long-term tendencies of an individual, whereas Condition represents the temporary, symptomatic manifestation of imbalance currently being experienced."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a bright red face, rapid pulse (95 bpm), and complains of 'burning' sensations. Which tissue state is most likely represented?",
            "options": [
                "Cold (Depression)",
                "Damp (Stagnation)",
                "Heat (Excitation)",
                "Dry (Atrophy)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heat (Excitation) is characterized by hyper-function, redness, rapid pulse, and sensations of warmth or burning, often involving an overactive sympathetic nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Six Tissue States' model, which symptoms are most characteristic of the 'Damp Relaxation' (Atrophy) state?",
            "options": [
                "Spasms, cramps, and a wiry pulse.",
                "Chronic thirst, brittle nails, and dry mucous membranes.",
                "Leaking fluids, such as chronic diarrhea, pale frequent urination, or night sweats.",
                "High fever, sharp pains, and a thick yellow tongue coating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Damp Relaxation (also known as Tissue Relaxation) is defined by the inability of tissues to hold fluids, leading to 'leaking' symptoms like diarrhea, prolapse, or excessive discharge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When assessing the tongue, what does a 'scalloped' or 'teeth-marked' edge typically indicate in energetic pattern recognition?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive Heat in the Heart",
                "Dampness and Spleen Qi Deficiency (Fluid accumulation)",
                "Extreme Dryness and lack of Yin",
                "Acute viral infection"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Teeth marks (scallops) on the sides of the tongue indicate that the tongue is swollen and pressing against the teeth, which is a classic sign of fluid stagnation or Dampness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A 'Wiry' or 'Tense' pulse is most commonly associated with which of the following tissue states?",
            "options": [
                "Tension (Wind/Constriction)",
                "Cold (Depression)",
                "Damp (Stagnation)",
                "Heat (Excitation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Wiry pulse feels like a tight guitar string and is the primary diagnostic indicator for the Tension (Wind/Constriction) state, reflecting nervous system stress or physical constriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "During the client intake process, why is it critical to identify 'Cold' patterns before administering cooling sedatives?",
            "options": [
                "Cooling sedatives will increase the metabolic rate too quickly.",
                "Cooling herbs in a Cold state can further depress metabolic function and worsen the condition.",
                "Cold patterns require 'Cold' herbs to balance the temperature via the Law of Similars.",
                "There is no risk; cooling herbs are generally safe for all constitutions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Administering cooling herbs to a client already in a state of 'Cold (Depression)' can further suppress cellular metabolism and vital energy, leading to deeper fatigue and stagnation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which specific observation would lead a practitioner to identify 'Damp Stagnation' rather than 'Damp Relaxation'?",
            "options": [
                "Clear, watery discharge and a pale tongue.",
                "A thick, greasy tongue coating and localized swelling or lymph congestion.",
                "Extreme thirst and a dry, cracked tongue.",
                "A rapid, thready pulse and red skin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Damp Stagnation involves an accumulation of metabolic waste and 'heavy' fluids, signaled by a thick, greasy coating on the tongue and physical blockages like swollen lymph nodes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In synthesizing a protocol for a 'Dry Atrophy' state, which class of herbs is considered the primary therapeutic choice?",
            "options": [
                "Astringents (to tighten tissues)",
                "Pungent Stimulants (to increase heat)",
                "Demulcents and Tonics (to restore moisture and nutrition)",
                "Strong Diuretics (to remove excess fluids)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dry Atrophy requires moistening and nourishing. Demulcents (which provide mucilage) and Tonics (which restore tissue integrity) are the standard intervention."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Jane, 34, presents with alternating constipation and diarrhea, sharp abdominal cramps that move location, and a pulse that feels 'tight.' What is the most likely energetic pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Fixed Heat",
                "Damp Stagnation",
                "Tension (Wind/Constriction)",
                "Cold Depression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alternating symptoms, 'moving' pain, and a tight/wiry pulse are hallmark signs of the Tension (Wind) state, reflecting erratic physiological function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When observing the 'Spirit' (or 'Shen') during an intake, a dull, lackluster expression in the eyes is statistically correlated with which energetic deficit?",
            "options": [
                "Excess Heat in the Liver",
                "A deficiency in Vital Essence or 'Cold' depression",
                "Acute Wind-Heat invasion",
                "Excessive Dampness in the Gallbladder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Shen' or Spirit is observed through the eyes; a lack of 'glitter' or vitality in the eyes typically indicates a deep-seated Cold state or a deficiency in the body's fundamental energy (Qi/Essence)."
