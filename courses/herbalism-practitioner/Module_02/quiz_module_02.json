            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "A client presents with a rapid pulse (95 bpm), a bright red tongue body, and acute localized inflammation. According to the Six Tissue States, which state is most likely present?",
            "options": [
                "Heat (Excitation)",
                "Cold (Depression)",
                "Damp (Stagnation)",
                "Dry (Atrophy)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Heat or Excitation is characterized by increased metabolic activity, rapid pulse, redness, and acute inflammatory responses."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Relaxation' (Atony) as a tissue state, which clinical sign is most indicative of the loss of structural integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Spasmodic coughing and tight muscles",
                "Chronic diarrhea, organ prolapse, or leaking of fluids",
                "Withered, thin tongue with cracks",
                "A wiry pulse that feels like a guitar string"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relaxation or Atony represents a state where tissues cannot hold fluids or maintain their position, leading to prolapse, incontinence, or chronic discharge."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A 2019 study on tongue diagnosis reliability found that 'Tongue Coating Thickness' had a high inter-rater agreement (Kappa > 0.70). If you observe a thick, greasy yellow coating, what does this suggest in pattern recognition?",
            "options": [
                "Systemic Cold and Dryness",
                "Damp-Heat accumulation",
                "Blood Deficiency",
                "Nervous System Tension"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A thick, greasy coating indicates Dampness (mucoid accumulation), while a yellow color indicates the presence of Heat."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When assessing the pulse, a 'Wiry' or 'String-like' quality—reminiscent of a taut musical string—is the primary indicator for which tissue state?",
            "options": [
                "Damp (Stagnation)",
                "Cold (Depression)",
                "Tension (Constriction)",
                "Dry (Atrophy)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tension/Constriction involves the constriction of the nervous system and musculature, which manifests in the pulse as a wiry, forceful quality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue, a pale, swollen tongue with teeth marks (scalloping) on the edges, and a slow, deep pulse. What is the most appropriate energetic synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Heat and Dryness",
                "Tension and Excitation",
                "Cold and Damp Stagnation",
                "Dryness and Constriction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A pale, swollen tongue with scalloping indicates Dampness and lack of metabolic fire (Cold/Depression), often associated with poor fluid metabolism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Dry/Atrophy' tissue state, what is the underlying physiological mechanism that often leads to the 'withered' appearance of the tongue?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive fluid retention in the extracellular matrix",
                "Lack of nutrition and hydration reaching the tissues",
                "Spasmodic contraction of the lingual muscles",
                "Hyper-metabolic activity burning off fluids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dryness/Atrophy occurs when tissues are under-nourished and dehydrated, leading to a loss of function and a thin, shrunken, or cracked appearance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "During the client intake process, 'Pattern Recognition' is prioritized over 'Symptom Matching.' Why is this approach considered superior in clinical herbalism?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the practitioner to use fewer herbs",
                "It addresses the underlying tissue environment rather than just suppressing signs",
                "It is faster than performing a full intake",
                "It ignores the client's subjective experience in favor of objective data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pattern recognition identifies the 'energetic terrain' or tissue state, allowing the practitioner to choose herbs that correct the environment, which in turn resolves multiple symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which specific area of the tongue is traditionally associated with the 'Digestive Center' (Stomach and Spleen) in most energetic assessment models?",
            "options": [
                "The very tip",
                "The sides/margins",
                "The center/middle third",
                "The very back (root)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The center of the tongue reflects the state of the middle burner, specifically the stomach and spleen/pancreas digestive functions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving a 55-year-old male with chronic 'Cold/Depression' (pale skin, cold extremities, bradycardia), which herbal action would be directly indicated to balance this state?",
            "options": [
                "Refrigerant (Cooling)",
                "Sedative (Relaxing)",
                "Stimulant (Warming)",
                "Astringent (Binding)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cold/Depression requires stimulation and warming to increase metabolic activity and blood flow."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "If a client exhibits 'Damp Stagnation' (lymphatic congestion) paired with 'Tension' (spasmodic pain), what is the primary goal of the synthesized protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To dry the tissues and increase constriction",
                "To move fluids (alterative) and relax the nervous system (antispasmodic)",
                "To cool the blood and astringe the fluids",
                "To suppress the immune system and induce sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The synthesis requires moving the stagnant fluids (addressing Damp) while simultaneously releasing the constriction (addressing Tension)."
