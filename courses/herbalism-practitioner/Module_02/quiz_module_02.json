            "question": "When identifying members of the Lamiaceae (Mint) family, which combination of morphological characteristics is considered diagnostic?",
            "options": [
                "Alternate leaves, hollow stems, and umbel-shaped inflorescences",
                "Square stems, opposite leaves, and zygomorphic (bilateral) flowers",
                "Basal rosette, milky sap, and composite flower heads",
                "Parallel leaf venation, 3-petaled flowers, and bulbous roots"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Lamiaceae family is characterized by four-angled (square) stems, opposite leaf arrangement, and irregular, two-lipped (zygomorphic) flowers, which typically contain high concentrations of volatile oils in glandular trichomes."

            "question": "In the binomial nomenclature system, what does the 'x' indicate in the name Mentha x piperita?",
            "options": [
                "The plant is an extinct wild variety",
                "The plant is a polyploid mutation",
                "The plant is a sterile hybrid of two different species",
                "The plant is a subspecies found only in specific geographic regions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'x' indicates a hybrid. Mentha x piperita (Peppermint) is a sterile hybrid of Mentha aquatica (Water Mint) and Mentha spicata (Spearmint), necessitating vegetative propagation rather than seed."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of plant physiology discussed in Lesson 6, why is it traditionally recommended to harvest aromatic leaves and flowers in the mid-morning after the dew has dried?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the concentration of water-soluble polysaccharides",
                "To prevent the development of fungal pathogens during the drying process",
                "To capture peak essential oil content before the sun's heat causes volatilization",
                "To ensure the plant has completed its daily cycle of photorespiration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Volatile oils (essential oils) are at their highest concentration in the morning. As the day progresses and temperatures rise, these volatile compounds evaporate into the atmosphere to protect the plant from heat stress."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A practitioner is foraging for Wild Carrot (Daucus carota) but notices purple spotting on the smooth, hairless stem of a look-alike. Which toxic species have they likely encountered?",
            "options": [
                "Cicuta maculata (Water Hemlock)",
                "Conium maculatum (Poison Hemlock)",
                "Digitalis purpurea (Foxglove)",
                "Aconitum napellus (Monkshood)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conium maculatum (Poison Hemlock) is a deadly member of the Apiaceae family. It is distinguished from Daucus carota by its smooth, hairless stem with characteristic purple/reddish blotches and its mousy odor."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'Terroir' and phytochemistry, a 2021 study on Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) demonstrated that plants grown in high-altitude environments produced significantly higher levels of which constituent?",
            "options": [
                "Hypericin (due to increased UV-B radiation exposure)",
                "Chlorophyll (due to lower CO2 levels)",
                "Mucilage (due to increased humidity)",
                "Fixed oils (due to colder soil temperatures)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Environmental stress, particularly increased UV-B radiation at higher altitudes, triggers the 'Environmental Stress Hypothesis,' leading the plant to produce higher levels of protective secondary metabolites like hypericin and flavonoids."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When harvesting roots for medicinal use (such as Taraxacum officinale), why is the late autumn harvest generally preferred over the early spring harvest for prebiotic applications?",
            "options": [
                "The roots contain higher levels of bitter alkaloids in the autumn",
                "The plant has converted its starch into inulin to survive the winter",
                "The roots are more fibrous and easier to dry in the autumn",
                "Autumn roots contain higher concentrations of vitamin C"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In autumn, plants move their energy reserves into the roots. In plants like Dandelion or Burdock, this results in a high concentration of inulin, a prebiotic polysaccharide. In spring, this inulin is converted back into simple sugars to fuel new growth."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which anatomical part of the flower is the primary source of the yellow pigment and medicinal resins in Calendula officinalis?",
            "options": [
                "The sepals and pedicel",
                "The fibrous receptacle",
                "The ray and disc florets (the 'petals' and center)",
                "The style and stigma only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Asteraceae family features composite heads. In Calendula, the medicinal resins and carotenoids are concentrated in the ray and disc florets, which is why the whole flower head is harvested rather than just the petals."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "To preserve thermolabile constituents (such as enzymes and certain volatile oils) during the drying process, what is the maximum recommended temperature for the drying environment?",
            "options": [
                "75°F (24°C)",
                "110°F (43°C)",
                "160°F (71°C)",
                "212°F (100°C)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Drying temperatures should generally not exceed 110°F (43°C). Temperatures above this threshold can cause the rapid degradation of volatile oils and the denaturing of sensitive enzymes and glycosides."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A soil pH of 5.5 (acidic) is most likely to affect the phytochemistry of a medicinal garden by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the bioavailability of all macronutrients",
                "Restricting the uptake of essential minerals like magnesium and calcium",
                "Eliminating the risk of heavy metal accumulation",
                "Increasing the water-retention capacity of the rhizosphere"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soil pH significantly affects nutrient availability. In acidic soils (below 6.0), the availability of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus decreases, which can stunt plant growth and alter the production of secondary metabolites."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Involucre' often found in the Asteraceae family?",
            "options": [
                "The specialized root system of perennial herbs",
                "A ring of bracts (modified leaves) surrounding the base of the flower head",
                "The reproductive organ containing the pollen",
                "The waxy coating on the leaf surface that prevents transpiration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The involucre is a collection of bracts (phyllaries) that support and protect the composite flower head of the Asteraceae family. Its appearance is a key diagnostic feature in field identification."
