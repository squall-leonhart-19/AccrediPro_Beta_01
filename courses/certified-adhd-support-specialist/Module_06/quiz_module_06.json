        {
            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "Which specific region of the brain serves as the 'Command Center' for executive functions and is frequently observed to have delayed cortical maturation in children with ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)",
                "The Corpus Callosum",
                "The Brainstem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dlPFC is the primary hub for executive functions like planning, working memory, and inhibition. Research shows a maturation delay of approximately 2-3 years in this region for individuals with ADHD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Working memory is often described as the 'Mental Sketchpad.' According to the module, what is the primary reason individuals with ADHD struggle with complex multi-step instructions?",
            "options": [
                "They have a total lack of long-term memory storage",
                "They are intentionally defiant of authority",
                "Information 'decays' rapidly before it can be encoded or used",
                "They possess an overactive auditory processing speed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In ADHD, the 'buffer' of working memory is smaller and more volatile, meaning information decays or is pushed out by new stimuli before it can be acted upon."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is best defined as:",
            "options": [
                "A conscious choice to be dramatic in social situations",
                "An extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception of being rejected or criticized",
                "A secondary symptom of Generalized Anxiety Disorder only",
                "The inability to recognize facial expressions in others"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is a common but often overlooked component of ADHD involving intense emotional pain tied to perceived or actual rejection, often linked to impaired PFC-Amygdala communication."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In the study of inhibition, what does the 'Stop-Signal Reaction Time' (SSRT) measure?",
            "options": [
                "How fast a person can run 100 meters",
                "The time it takes for the brain to suppress a motor response once a 'stop' cue is given",
                "The delay between waking up and taking medication",
                "The speed at which a person reads a sentence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SSRT is a standard neuro-psychological metric used to quantify inhibitory control. Individuals with ADHD typically show significantly longer SSRTs than neurotypical controls."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client with 'Time Blindness' struggles to estimate how long a task will take. Which brain structure, responsible for non-conscious timing and coordination, is often implicated in this deficit?",
            "options": [
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Visual Cortex",
                "The Medulla Oblongata",
                "The Thalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The cerebellum is heavily involved in the internal 'clock' and temporal processing. Structural differences here contribute to the 'nearsightedness to time' seen in ADHD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Task initiation failure in ADHD is frequently caused by 'Analysis Paralysis.' What is the most effective neuro-specialist strategy to overcome this?",
            "options": [
                "Waiting for a 'burst of motivation' to arrive",
                "Increasing the complexity of the task to make it more interesting",
                "Reducing the 'Activation Energy' by breaking the task into 'micro-steps'",
                "Using negative reinforcement and shame"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By reducing the cognitive load and 'activation energy' required to start, we bypass the executive function bottleneck. Breaking a task into steps as small as 'open the laptop' helps initiate movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Which executive function is being tested when a client is asked to switch between sorting cards by 'color' to sorting them by 'shape'?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibition",
                "Cognitive Flexibility (Set-Shifting)",
                "Emotional Regulation",
                "Non-verbal Working Memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive flexibility, or set-shifting, is the ability to transition between different concepts or rules. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test is the gold standard for measuring this."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A client consistently underestimates the time needed for a project, leading to 'all-nighters.' This is an example of the 'Planning Fallacy.' Which strategy helps mitigate this?",
            "options": [
                "Backward Mapping (starting from the deadline and working toward today)",
                "Buying a more expensive digital planner",
                "Telling the client to 'just try harder'",
                "Removing all deadlines to reduce pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Backward mapping/chaining allows the brain to visualize the sequence of events and the time required for each, making the future deadline more 'real' in the present."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "According to Dr. Russell Barkley's model, ADHD is primarily a developmental disorder of:",

                "Intelligence and IQ",

                "Sensory processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Barkley emphasizes that ADHD is not a disorder of 'knowing what to do,' but a disorder of 'doing what you know' at the 'point of performance' due to self-regulation deficits."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, age 32, finds herself unable to start her taxes because the 'whole thing' feels like an insurmountable mountain. She instead spends 4 hours organizing her spice rack. This is a classic example of:",
            "options": [
                "Productive Procrastination driven by Task Initiation deficits",
                "High Cognitive Flexibility",

                "Lack of interest in spices"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Productive procrastination occurs when an individual completes lower-priority tasks to avoid the high 'activation energy' or emotional 'Wall of Awful' associated with a more complex, daunting task."
