            "question": "In the context of ADHD in the Corporate Executive Space, what is the primary reason the 'ADHD Tax' often manifests as a 'Delegation Deficit'?",
            "options": [
                "Executives with ADHD are biologically incapable of trusting subordinates.",
                "The fear of losing control over the 'vision' leads to micromanagement of low-value administrative tasks.",
                "A lack of interest in high-level strategy causes them to focus on small details.",
                "Executive functioning deficits make it impossible to explain tasks to others."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many executives with ADHD struggle with the 'Innovation-Implementation Gap,' where they hold onto administrative tasks due to a fear that delegating will lead to a loss of momentum or vision, despite these tasks draining their limited executive function reserves."

            "question": "Research on high-performance athletes suggests that ADHD prevalence in elite sports is significantly higher than the general population. Which specific trait is often cited as a competitive advantage in high-speed sports like hockey or racing?",
            "options": [
                "Superior long-term memory for playbooks",
                "Enhanced peripheral processing and faster reaction times in high-stimulation environments",
                "A natural tendency toward rigid, repetitive training schedules",
                "Reduced need for physical recovery time due to hyperactivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ADHD brain often thrives in high-stimulation environments where rapid-fire decision-making is required, allowing athletes to process environmental cues faster than neurotypical peers during 'flow state' moments."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Twice-Exceptional (2e) learners in higher education often face a 'masking' effect. How does this typically present in a clinical or academic setting?",
            "options": [
                "The ADHD symptoms are so severe they hide the student's high intelligence.",
                "The student's high intelligence compensates for ADHD deficits, resulting in 'average' performance that prevents them from receiving support.",
                "The student uses physical masks to hide facial tics associated with ADHD.",
                "The student performs exceptionally well in all areas, making the ADHD diagnosis irrelevant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "2e individuals often use their high cognitive abilities to develop complex coping mechanisms that mask their executive function deficits, leading to a 'paradox of underachievement' or being overlooked for services because they are not 'failing' by traditional standards."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "According to studies on 'The Founder’s Brain,' entrepreneurs with ADHD are significantly more likely to engage in 'Divergent Thinking.' What is a common risk associated with this in a startup environment?",
            "options": [
                "An inability to generate new ideas for the business",
                "Excessive focus on a single product for decades",
                "The 'Shiny Object Syndrome,' where the founder abandons viable projects for new, more stimulating ideas",
                "A refusal to take risks or seek venture capital"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While divergent thinking fuels innovation, it often leads to 'Shiny Object Syndrome,' where the founder's need for novelty causes them to pivot too frequently, preventing the business from reaching the 'implementation' phase of the lifecycle."

                "Encouraging the client to work 24/7 during a hyperfocus episode to maximize output",
                "Switching the client to a rigid 9-to-5 office job to provide structure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because the creative ADHD brain often operates in bursts, the most sustainable approach is to lean into the 'sprints' while building in non-negotiable recovery periods to prevent the inevitable crash and subsequent depressive episodes."

            "id": "q27_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that 25-40% of the prison population has ADHD, often undiagnosed and untreated, which contributes to higher rates of impulsivity-driven crimes and recidivism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "STEM work requires deep cognitive loads. Time-blocking reduces the cost of context switching, and body doubling (working alongside someone else) provides the external accountability needed to stay on task during 'boring' but necessary data cleaning or documentation."

            "id": "q27_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD and early-stage neurodegenerative diseases share overlapping symptoms (forgetfulness, distractibility). Practitioners must use longitudinal history to determine if the symptoms are lifelong (ADHD) or a new decline (MCI)."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study on ADHD in the workplace found that employees who disclosed their diagnosis and received 'micro-accommodations' showed a 30% increase in job satisfaction. Which of the following is considered a 'micro-accommodation'?",

                "A 50% reduction in total workload",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-accommodations are small, low-cost adjustments—like noise-canceling headphones or recording software—that mitigate specific sensory or executive function barriers without fundamentally altering the job requirements."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "In the 'Systems and Data' (STEM) lesson, the 'Interest-Based Nervous System' is discussed. How does this system affect a software engineer's ability to complete 'technical debt' tasks?",
            "options": [
                "They will complete them first because they are easy.",
                "They will likely procrastinate on them because they lack the novelty or urgency required to trigger dopamine release.",
                "The engineer will find them more stimulating than new feature development.",
                "It has no impact on technical tasks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Technical debt (fixing old bugs, documentation) is often repetitive and lacks novelty. For an interest-based nervous system, these tasks provide little stimulation, making them significantly harder to initiate than the 'novel' challenge of writing new code."
