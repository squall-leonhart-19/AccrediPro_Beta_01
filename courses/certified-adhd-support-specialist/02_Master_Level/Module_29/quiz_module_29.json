            "question": "In the Unified Biopsychosocial-Environmental Framework, which mechanism describes how environmental factors like chronic stress can 'turn on' or 'turn off' genetic expressions related to dopamine transporter density?",
            "options": [
                "Neuroplasticity",
                "Epigenetic modification",
                "Synaptic pruning",
                "Mendelian inheritance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics refers to the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, often triggered by environmental stressors."

            "question": "A Lead Practitioner is evaluating a client with suspected ADHD and Bipolar II. Which clinical feature is the most reliable 'differential' marker indicating Bipolar II over ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic distractibility and restlessness",
                "Impulsive spending and social disinhibition",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While ADHD is a trait-based, chronic condition, Bipolar II is characterized by distinct mood episodes (hypomania) that represent a clear departure from the individual's baseline."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Social Model of Disability posits that disability is caused by the way society is organized, rather than by a person's impairment. Advocacy focuses on systemic and environmental modification."

            "question": "In the critical appraisal of neurotechnology, a 2023 meta-analysis of neurofeedback (n=1,200+) found that while parent-rated 'unblinded' scores showed an effect size (d) of 0.6, 'blinded' teacher ratings often dropped to:",
            "options": [
                "0.8 (Stronger effect)",

                "The effect size remained the same"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blinded ratings in ADHD research (where the rater doesn't know the treatment status) often show significantly lower effect sizes for neurofeedback compared to unblinded parent ratings, suggesting a placebo or expectation effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Lead Practitioner manages the 'Care Constellation' by integrating information from various specialists (doctors, teachers, therapists) to ensure the client receives cohesive care."

            "question": "Which specific risk factor is a 'red flag' in Crisis Intervention for ADHD, as it is associated with a 2-3x higher risk of suicidal ideation compared to the general population?",
            "options": [
                "High intelligence (IQ > 120)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional dysregulation combined with the impulsivity inherent in ADHD (and often exacerbated by ODD) significantly increases the risk for high-risk behaviors and crisis situations."

            "options": [
                "It is shorter and takes less time to complete",
                "It measures real-world impact across domains (work, family, social) rather than just symptom counts",
                "It is the only scale that can diagnose ADHD",
                "It focuses exclusively on brain-wave patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While symptom scales (ADHD-RS-IV) track the severity of traits, functional scales (WFIRS) track how those traits actually impair the client's life, which is the primary goal of Master-level intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP is the 'three-legged stool' of clinical expertise, scientific evidence, and the unique needs/values of the client."

            "question": "Case Study: 'David' (Age 34) has ADHD and chronic unemployment. He has failed multiple CBT programs. A Lead Practitioner discovers David has severe 'Time Blindness' and a workplace that requires strict self-scheduling. What is the 'Master Integration' approach?",
            "options": [
                "Refer David for more CBT to fix his 'motivation'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves both skill-building (prosthetic timers) and institutional advocacy (ROWE) to bridge the gap between David's biology and his environment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Statistical significance tells us if an effect exists; clinical significance tells us if that effect is large enough to actually matter in the life of the patient."
