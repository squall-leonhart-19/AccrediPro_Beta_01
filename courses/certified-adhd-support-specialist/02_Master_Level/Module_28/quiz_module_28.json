            "question": "In acute crisis de-escalation for an individual with ADHD, which physiological factor is most likely to exacerbate the 'emotional hijacking' of the amygdala?",
            "options": [
                "Hypoglycemia and sleep deprivation",
                "Excessive dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex",
                "High executive function load",
                "Suppression of the sympathetic nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Individuals with ADHD are more susceptible to emotional dysregulation when physiological 'bottom-up' triggers like hypoglycemia or sleep deprivation are present, as these further weaken the already taxed prefrontal 'top-down' control."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis regarding ADHD and Substance Use Disorders (SUD) indicated that adults with untreated ADHD are approximately how many times more likely to develop a SUD compared to the general population?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times",
                "2 to 3 times",
                "5 to 7 times",
                "10 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that untreated ADHD increases the risk of SUD by 2 to 3 times, often due to self-medication of executive function deficits and emotional dysregulation."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "When assessing suicide risk in ADHD clients, which specific trait is the strongest predictor of a transition from suicidal ideation to a lethal attempt?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperactivity",
                "Inattentiveness",
                "Trait Impulsivity",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While ideation is common in many disorders, the 'trait impulsivity' inherent in ADHD acts as a bridge that facilitates the rapid transition from thought to life-threatening action during a crisis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep disorders, particularly OSA, can mimic or exacerbate ADHD symptoms to the point where stimulants provide little benefit because the underlying neurobiological issue is oxygen deprivation and sleep fragmentation."

            "explanation": "Studies across international justice systems consistently find that 25-30% of the prison population meets the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, significantly higher than the 3-5% found in the general adult population."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In the context of complex family dynamics, 'High Expressed Emotion' (High EE) in parents is correlated with which outcome for children with ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Improved medication adherence",
                "Higher rates of symptom relapse and oppositional behavior",

                "Development of superior coping mechanisms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Expressed Emotion (criticism, hostility, or emotional over-involvement) creates a high-stress environment that triggers the ADHD nervous system, leading to increased symptom severity and behavioral escalation."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "What is a primary clinical differentiator between ADHD-related distractibility and Trauma-related hypervigilance?",

                "ADHD distractibility is always external; Trauma is always internal",
                "Trauma-related hypervigilance is a search for threat; ADHD distractibility is a search for stimulation",
                "ADHD symptoms only appear in childhood; Trauma only appears in adulthood",
                "There is no clinical difference; they are the same mechanism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both look like 'inattention,' the driver is different: the traumatized brain is scanning for danger (safety-seeking), whereas the ADHD brain is scanning for novelty or interest (dopamine-seeking)."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "According to risk management protocols, if a client with ADHD expresses a 'vague' desire to harm an identifiable third party during an impulsive outburst, what is the practitioner's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate involuntary hospitalization",
                "Calling the police immediately",
                "Assessing the 'imminence' and 'capacity' versus impulsive venting",
                "Terminating the session and the professional relationship"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because ADHD involves high emotional lability and impulsive speech, the practitioner must distinguish between 'venting' (emotional discharge) and a true 'threat' (intent, plan, and means) before breaching confidentiality."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",

            "options": [
                "Short-acting Methylphenidate",
                "High-dose Dextroamphetamine",
                "Non-stimulants like Atomoxetine or Alpha-2 Agonists",
                "Benzodiazepines"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-stimulants carry no diversion risk and have a lower abuse potential, making them the first-line choice in forensic settings or for clients with active, severe stimulant-specific SUD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Spillover Effect' refers to how the executive function deficits of a parent (e.g., inability to organize schedules or maintain consistency) directly undermine the treatment and progress of the child's ADHD."
