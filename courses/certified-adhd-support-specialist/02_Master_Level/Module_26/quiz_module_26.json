            "question": "In the context of ADHD Program Architecture (L1), what is the primary objective of 'Cognitive Scaffolding'?",
            "options": [
                "To permanently replace the client's internal executive functions with external software.",
                "To provide temporary external structures that facilitate success while internal skills are being developed.",
                "To ensure the client is never required to make an independent decision.",
                "To maximize the specialist's billable hours through intensive monitoring."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive scaffolding involves creating external supports (checklists, timers, environmental cues) that act as a 'prosthetic' for executive functions, which are gradually faded as the client internalizes new habits and skills."

            "options": [
                "Social Loafing, where individuals work harder in a group than alone.",
                "Cognitive Overload, where the social demands of the group exceed the client's regulatory capacity.",
                "Hyperfocus, where the group becomes too efficient and finishes the curriculum early.",
                "The 'Hawthorne Effect', which only occurs in individual coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For ADHD clients, the 'Social Facilitation Effect' (performing better in the presence of others) must be balanced against the risk of Cognitive Overload, where the complexity of group dynamics distracts from the coaching objectives."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Universal Design for Productivity suggests that workplace modifications (like quiet zones or flexible task-management tools) often benefit the entire workforce while specifically supporting those with ADHD."

                "Tutoring is only for students with ADHD, while coaching is for neurotypical students.",
                "Coaching is strictly for college students, while tutoring is for K-12.",
                "There is no functional difference; the terms are used interchangeably in professional settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Academic tutoring is content-specific (e.g., Math or History), whereas Executive Function coaching focuses on the underlying processes—planning, initiation, and emotional regulation—required to succeed in any subject."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In behavioral sciences and ADHD research, a Cohen’s d of 0.8 or higher is considered a large effect size, indicating a substantial and clinically significant impact of the intervention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Forgetting Curve' suggests that information is lost over time if not reinforced. Hybrid models use asynchronous tools (videos, reminders, worksheets) to provide continuous reinforcement between live coaching sessions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SOPs are the foundation of operational excellence and scaling; they allow a practice to maintain high quality and consistency as more clients or team members are added."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Task chunking reduces cognitive load by breaking complex projects into manageable pieces, which prevents the 'paralysis' often associated with ADHD and leads to higher productivity."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For high-intensity coaching where deep interaction and accountability are required, a group size of 4 to 8 is ideal. Larger groups often lead to decreased engagement and increased distraction for ADHD participants."
