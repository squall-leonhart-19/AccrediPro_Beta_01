            "question": "Neuroanatomical research, including a landmark 2017 study by Hoogman et al. (n=3,242), identified significant volume reductions in which specific subcortical structures in individuals with ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "The Hypothalamus and Pituitary gland",
                "The Accumbens, Amygdala, and Caudate",
                "The Occipital lobe and Primary Visual Cortex",
                "The Pineal gland and Brainstem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ENIGMA ADHD working group found that the volumes of the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen were smaller in individuals with ADHD, particularly in children."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In the context of neurochemical mechanisms, the 'Tonic-Phasic Dopamine Theory' suggests that ADHD symptoms arise from which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive tonic dopamine levels leading to constant overstimulation",
                "Complete absence of phasic dopamine responses to reward",
                "Low tonic dopamine levels causing an exaggerated phasic response to immediate stimuli",
                "High levels of serotonin inhibiting the production of norepinephrine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is often characterized by low background (tonic) dopamine, which makes the brain more reactive to the sharp spikes (phasic) of dopamine triggered by novel or immediate rewards, leading to distractibility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Functional connectivity studies show that in ADHD, the 'Default Mode Network' (DMN) often fails to deactivate when the 'Task-Positive Network' (TPN) is engaged. This is clinically observed as:",
            "options": [
                "Enhanced hyperfocus on complex mathematical tasks",
                "Intrusive 'mind-wandering' and internal distractions during goal-directed activity",
                "Superior memory recall for names and dates",
                "A significant increase in motor coordination and balance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The failure of the DMN to suppress during task-engagement leads to interference from internal thoughts, which manifests as the mind-wandering and 'zoning out' typical of ADHD."

            "id": "q8_4",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Barkley posits that Behavioral Inhibition (the ability to delay a response) is the core deficit; without it, the other executive functions cannot operate effectively."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Meta-analyses of twin studies (e.g., Faraone & Larsson, 2019) consistently report that the heritability of ADHD is approximately:",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is among the most heritable psychiatric conditions, with genetic factors accounting for roughly 74% to 80% of the variance in the population."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "When performing a differential diagnosis, how does the clinical presentation of 'mood lability' in ADHD typically differ from Bipolar Disorder?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD mood shifts are usually triggered by events and last hours; Bipolar shifts are often autonomous and last days/weeks",
                "ADHD mood shifts only occur during the night, whereas Bipolar shifts occur in the morning",
                "ADHD is characterized by prolonged periods of mania lasting at least 14 days",
                "There is no difference; mood lability is only present in Bipolar Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ADHD emotional dysregulation is typically 'reactive' (triggered by immediate stressors or frustrations) and transient, whereas Bipolar Disorder involves distinct, sustained episodes of mania or depression."

                "Overt motor hyperactivity decreases and is replaced by 'internalized restlessness'",
                "Hyperactivity increases significantly in the third decade of life",
                "The need for executive function support decreases as the brain reaches full maturity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While visible hyperactivity (running, climbing) tends to decline with age, it often transforms into a subjective sense of inner tension, restlessness, or the inability to relax."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "The DSM-5-TR requires that for an adult (age 17+) to be diagnosed with ADHD, they must exhibit at least how many symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity?",

                "6 symptoms",
                "4 symptoms",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DSM-5 reduced the threshold for adults (17 and older) to 5 symptoms, acknowledging that the previous 6-symptom threshold was designed for children."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD is not a lack of attention, but a dysregulation of attention. High-stimulation tasks (like gaming) provide the dopamine necessary for focus, which 'boring' tasks lack."
