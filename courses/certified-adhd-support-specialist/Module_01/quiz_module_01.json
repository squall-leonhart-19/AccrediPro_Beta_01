            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In the historical evolution of the ADHD construct, which term was utilized in the DSM-II (1968) to describe what we now recognize as ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Minimal Brain Dysfunction",
                "Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood",
                "Attention Deficit Disorder (with or without Hyperactivity)",
                "Post-Encephalitic Behavior Disorder"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DSM-II (1968) used the term 'Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood,' focusing primarily on motor activity rather than cognitive inattention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological foundations of ADHD, what is the primary dysfunction observed in dopamine signaling within the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive tonic dopamine levels leading to over-stimulation",
                "Insufficient phasic spikes during reward processing",
                "Low tonic dopamine levels that fail to sufficiently stimulate D1 receptors",
                "Complete absence of norepinephrine transporter (NET) activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is characterized by low 'tonic' (baseline) dopamine levels, which results in a low signal-to-noise ratio; this prevents the PFC from effectively filtering distractions via D1 receptor stimulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Functional connectivity studies in ADHD brains frequently show a failure in the 'anti-correlation' between which two neural networks?",
            "options": [
                "The Visual Network and the Auditory Network",
                "The Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Task-Positive Network (TPN)",
                "The Cerebellum and the Occipital Lobe",
                "The Limbic System and the Brainstem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In neurotypical brains, the DMN (internal thought) deactivates when the TPN (external task) activates. In ADHD, the DMN fails to suppress, leading to 'intrusive thoughts' and lapses in attention."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Large-scale twin studies and meta-analyses have consistently estimated the heritability of ADHD to be approximately what percentage?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is among the most heritable psychiatric conditions, with meta-analyses (such as Faraone et al.) consistently placing heritability at roughly 74% to 80%."

            "id": "q1_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Barkley’s model posits that the fundamental deficit in ADHD is Behavioral Inhibition, which provides the necessary delay for the four secondary executive functions to operate."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When diagnosing an adult (age 17 or older) using DSM-5-TR criteria, how many symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity are required for a diagnosis?",
            "options": [
                "6 symptoms in either category",
                "5 symptoms in either category",
                "4 symptoms in both categories",
                "9 symptoms total across both categories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While children require 6 symptoms, the DSM-5-TR reduced the threshold for adults (17+) to 5 symptoms, reflecting the developmental decline in overt hyperactive behaviors."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Research into comorbidities indicates that approximately what percentage of adults with ADHD will meet the criteria for at least one other psychiatric disorder in their lifetime?",

                "20%",
                "45%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception; studies show that up to 80% of adults with ADHD have at least one comorbid condition, such as anxiety, depression, or substance use disorder."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'lifespan trajectory' of ADHD symptoms as a child moves into adulthood?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperactivity usually increases while inattention decreases",
                "Inattention remains relatively stable, while overt hyperactivity often transitions into internal restlessness",
                "All symptoms typically remit by age 18 in 90% of cases",
                "Impulsivity is the only symptom that persists into the senior years"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While overt physical hyperactivity (climbing, running) often diminishes with age, inattention tends to persist, and hyperactivity often morphs into 'subjective' or internal restlessness."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which epigenetic/environmental factor has been most strongly correlated with an increased risk of ADHD phenotype expression in genetically predisposed individuals?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While diet is debated, prenatal exposure to environmental toxins like tobacco smoke, alcohol, and lead are well-documented non-inherited risk factors that impact gene expression in ADHD."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client presents with chronic 'mind-wandering,' frequent lost items, and a history of being called a 'daydreamer' in school, but no history of disruptive behavior. Which clinical presentation is most likely?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The description of mind-wandering, losing items, and lack of disruptive/hyperactive behavior is hallmark for the Predominantly Inattentive Presentation (formerly known as ADD)."
