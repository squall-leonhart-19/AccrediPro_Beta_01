            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve acts as a bidirectional 'superhighway' between the gut and the brain, transmitting signals from the microbiome that influence neurotransmitter production and ADHD symptom severity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that up to 75-80% of adults with ADHD exhibit a circadian rhythm shift, leading to Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, which significantly exacerbates executive dysfunction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body Doubling is a productivity strategy where the presence of another person (physical or virtual) helps an ADHD individual stay anchored to their task and reduces the likelihood of distraction."

            "options": [
                "They provide a predictable reward every 5 minutes",
                "They eliminate the need for dopamine production",
                "They create an unpredictable reward pattern that triggers intense dopamine spikes",
                "They decrease the activity of the Nucleus Accumbens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Variable ratio schedules (like social media feeds) provide rewards at unpredictable intervals, which the ADHD brain finds highly stimulating, leading to the 'dopamine loop' and compulsive checking."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 highlights that acute aerobic exercise increases the levels of which neurotrophic factor, often described as 'Miracle-Gro' for the brain?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a protein that supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth of new neurons and synapses, which is critical for improving executive function in ADHD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During the Luteal Phase, estrogen levels drop. Since estrogen modulates dopamine, this drop often leads to a significant increase in ADHD symptoms and a decrease in the effectiveness of stimulant medications."

            "id": "q11_7",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is associated with mind-wandering and self-referential thought. In ADHD, the DMN often fails to 'turn off' during tasks, but mindfulness helps regulate this network."

                "The final stage of ADHD burnout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coined by Brendan Mahan, the 'Wall of Awful' represents the emotional baggage (shame, guilt, failure) that builds up around a task, making it harder for an ADHD individual to start."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Switching a smartphone to grayscale reduces the neurochemical 'reward' of colorful icons and notifications, making the device less stimulating and easier to put down."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in the course found that 'Combined Interventions' (Exercise + Medication) showed what result compared to medication alone?",
