            "question": "In the architecture of Executive Function (EF), what is the primary distinction between 'Cool' EF and 'Hot' EF?",
            "options": [
                "Cool EF involves logic and task-oriented processes, while Hot EF involves emotional regulation and reward-based decision making.",
                "Cool EF refers to motor control, while Hot EF refers to cognitive flexibility.",
                "Cool EF is managed by the amygdala, while Hot EF is managed by the prefrontal cortex.",
                "Cool EF is only present in children, while Hot EF develops in adulthood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cool EF involves logic and objective tasks (working memory, planning), whereas Hot EF involves situations with high emotional stakes or social-affective significance, often involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex."

            "question": "Research into Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) suggests it is a common but non-DSM-5 feature of ADHD. What percentage of ADHD adults report experiencing significant RSD symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 75%",
                "Nearly 98-99%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Clinical experts like Dr. William Dodson have noted that nearly 98-99% of people with ADHD experience RSD, describing it as an intense, unbearable emotional pain resulting from perceived or actual rejection."

            "options": [
                "5% in ADHD vs 2% in general population",
                "25% in ADHD vs 10% in general population",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 75% of adults with ADHD have a delayed circadian rhythm (DSPS), where the internal clock is shifted 2-3 hours later than the societal norm."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of Sensory Processing, 'Sensory Gating' refers to the brain's ability to filter out redundant stimuli. How does this typically manifest in the ADHD brain?",
            "options": [
                "Hyper-efficient gating leading to sensory deprivation",
                "Deficient gating leading to sensory overload and inability to 'tune out' background noise",
                "Gating is only affected during sleep cycles",
                "Gating is identical to neurotypical brains but is ignored by the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD is often associated with deficient sensory gating, meaning the brain fails to filter out repetitive or irrelevant stimuli, leading to the characteristic distractibility and sensory overwhelm."

            "id": "q3_5",

            "options": [
                "Women do not develop ADHD until after puberty",
                "The symptoms of ADHD in women are usually purely physical hyperactivity",
                "Women are more likely to present with 'internalized' symptoms and high levels of social masking",
                "Hormonal changes in menopause are the only time ADHD becomes visible in women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Women often present with the Inattentive subtype and use 'masking' (compensatory strategies) to hide struggles, leading to late diagnosis when the 'internalized' cognitive load becomes unsustainable."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When performing a differential diagnosis between ADHD and Bipolar II Disorder, what is the most critical factor to evaluate?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of distractibility",
                "The person's age at the time of the assessment",
                "Whether the symptoms are chronic (ADHD) or episodic (Bipolar)",
                "The presence of impulsive spending"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is a neurodevelopmental, chronic condition with symptoms present since childhood. Bipolar Disorder is characterized by distinct mood episodes (mania/hypomania/depression) that represent a change from the person's baseline."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body Doubling involves having another person present (virtually or physically) while working. This provides social accountability and reduces the emotional activation required to initiate a difficult task."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In advanced assessment, why is the 'Observer Paradox' significant?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD individuals often over-report their symptoms compared to observers",
                "Because ADHD individuals often under-report their symptoms due to 'lack of insight' or internalizing, while observers only see externalized behaviors",
                "Because observers are usually biased toward a positive diagnosis",
                "Because the presence of an observer cures the symptoms of ADHD temporarily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Observer Paradox refers to the frequent discrepancy where the individual's self-report of internal struggle (Executive Function deficits) is much higher than what an external observer sees, or vice versa, necessitating multi-informant data."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in the module found that what percentage of adults with ADHD have at least one comorbid psychiatric condition?",
            "options": [
                "20%",
                "40%",
                "60%",
                "80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in adult ADHD, with approximately 80% of adults having at least one other psychiatric diagnosis, such as anxiety, depression, or substance use disorder."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which specific neurotransmitter pathway is most implicated in the 'Reward Deficiency Syndrome' seen in ADHD, leading to 'bottom-up' drive for stimulation?",
            "options": [
                "The Serotonergic pathway in the gut",
                "The Mesolimbic Dopamine pathway",
                "The GABAergic pathway in the cerebellum",
                "The Acetylcholine pathway in the brainstem"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mesolimbic Dopamine pathway (the reward circuit) is often under-stimulated in ADHD, leading individuals to seek 'high-stimulation' activities to reach a baseline level of engagement and arousal."
