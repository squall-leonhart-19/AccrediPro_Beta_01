            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The dlPFC is the primary site for high-level executive processing, including working memory, planning, and cognitive flexibility."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In Baddeley's Model of Working Memory, which component is responsible for coordinating the 'slave systems' and shifting attention between tasks?",

                "Visuospatial Sketchpad",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Central Executive acts as the 'manager,' directing attention and managing the flow of information to and from the other sub-systems."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client struggles to ignore the sound of a ticking clock while trying to read. This is a specific deficit in which type of inhibitory control?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interference control is the ability to filter out irrelevant sensory information or 'distractors' to maintain focus on a primary task."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "What term describes the cognitive error of continuing to apply a previously successful rule or behavior even after the task requirements have changed?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perseveration is a hallmark of poor cognitive flexibility, where the individual 'gets stuck' on a specific thought or action pattern."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Integrated Systems' approach, why is emotional regulation considered an executive function in ADHD populations?",
            "options": [
                "Because emotions are purely biological and cannot be managed",
                "Because it requires inhibiting an initial emotional impulse to allow for a goal-directed response",
                "Because ADHD only affects the emotional centers of the brain",
                "Because it is managed by the cerebellum rather than the PFC"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional regulation is an EF because it involves using self-directed actions (inhibition and metacognition) to modify an emotional state in service of a long-term goal."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "The 'Scalar Expectancy Theory' suggests that 'Time Blindness' in ADHD is caused by a dysfunction in which internal mechanism?",

                "The visual cortex's ability to see clocks",
                "The internal pacemaker and the accumulation of 'pulses' used to track duration",
                "The long-term memory's ability to store dates",
                "The auditory system's ability to hear alarms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scalar Expectancy Theory posits that the brain's internal clock (pacemaker) sends pulses that are 'counted' to track time; in ADHD, this pulse-counting is often inconsistent."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Metacognition is best defined as 'thinking about thinking.' Which of its two main components involves the active adjustment of cognitive strategies based on performance feedback?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metacognitive Regulation (or Control) is the 'doing' part of metacognition, where the individual monitors progress and changes their approach if it isn't working."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "Research on the developmental trajectory of ADHD suggests that the maturity of executive functions in children with ADHD typically lags behind neurotypical peers by approximately what percentage?",

                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests a developmental delay of roughly 30% in EF maturity, meaning a 10-year-old with ADHD may have the executive capacity of a 7-year-old."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Mark (28) frequently loses his place while following multi-step assembly instructions. Which intervention strategy directly addresses his Working Memory deficit?",

                "Giving him a reward for finishing the task",
                "Externalizing the steps using a visual checklist or 'point-of-performance' cues",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Since working memory has a limited capacity, 'externalizing' the information onto a checklist reduces the cognitive load on Mark's internal memory systems."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which neurochemical system is most closely associated with the 'reward-deficiency' aspect of executive dysfunction, leading to difficulties in sustained effort for non-preferred tasks?",

                "The Serotonergic System",
                "The Mesocorticolimbic Dopamine Pathway",
                "The GABAergic Pathway",
                "The Acetylcholine System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dopamine pathway regulates motivation and reward; dysfunction here makes it difficult for individuals with ADHD to stay engaged with tasks that do not provide immediate feedback."
