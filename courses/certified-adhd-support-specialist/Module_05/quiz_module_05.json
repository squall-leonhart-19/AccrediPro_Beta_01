            "question": "In the frontostriatal circuitry of an ADHD brain, which specific structural abnormality is most commonly associated with the failure of 'top-down' inhibitory control?",
            "options": [
                "Hypertrophy of the occipital lobe",
                "Reduced gray matter volume in the right inferior prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus",

                "Increased activation in the primary motor cortex during rest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroimaging consistently shows reduced volume and functional activation in the right inferior prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia (specifically the caudate), which are critical for inhibitory control."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "While dopamine is central to ADHD, Lesson 2 highlights the role of Norepinephrine. What is the primary function of Norepinephrine in the 'Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine' (LC-NE) system regarding attention?",
            "options": [
                "Regulating the reward-seeking behavior and satiety",
                "Modulating the signal-to-noise ratio to enhance focus on relevant stimuli",

                "Inhibiting the release of glutamate in the hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The LC-NE system functions to increase the 'signal' of important information while decreasing 'noise' (distractions), essentially tuning the brain's alertness to relevant tasks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Barkley posits that Behavioral Inhibition is the primary deficit; without the ability to delay a response, the other executive functions (working memory, self-regulation, etc.) cannot operate effectively."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While ADHD involves 'performance' deficits (forgetting, fidgeting), ODD is characterized by a 'willful' pattern of irritability and defiance against authority."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": [
                "They are too expensive to administer",
                "They rely on subjective perception and can be influenced by rater bias or 'halo effects'",
                "They only measure IQ, not ADHD symptoms",
                "They are only valid for children under the age of 10"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rating scales are subjective. Advanced protocols require multi-informant data, clinical interviews, and objective measures (like CPTs) to account for rater bias and context-specific symptoms."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah is using masking (socially performing) and compensatory scaffolding (over-committing/hyper-vigilance) to hide her underlying ADHD struggles."

            "question": "In the context of Neurotransmitter Dynamics, what is the 'Tonic vs. Phasic' dopamine imbalance theory?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD involves too much tonic dopamine and not enough phasic dopamine",
                "ADHD involves low tonic (background) dopamine levels and excessive phasic (reactive) spikes",
                "Dopamine is only released during sleep in the ADHD brain",
                "Tonic dopamine is responsible for muscle movement, while phasic is for memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The theory suggests that low tonic (baseline) dopamine levels in ADHD lead to exaggerated phasic (spike) releases in response to immediate rewards, driving impulsivity."
