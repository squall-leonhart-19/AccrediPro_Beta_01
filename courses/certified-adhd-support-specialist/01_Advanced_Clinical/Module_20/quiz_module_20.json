            "question": "In the context of psychometric foundations, a 'Reliability Coefficient' of 0.90 for an ADHD rating scale like the CAARS indicates which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The scale has 90% accuracy in diagnosing ADHD.",
                "90% of the variance in scores is due to true score variance rather than error.",
                "The scale is 90% more effective than a clinical interview.",
                "There is a 10% chance the client is malingering."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In psychometrics, reliability coefficients (like Cronbach's alpha) measure internal consistency; 0.90 means 90% of the variance is attributed to the 'true score,' which is considered excellent for clinical decision-making."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the DSM-IV required symptoms before age 7, the DSM-5 and the corresponding DIVA-5 protocol require evidence of symptoms and impairment before age 12."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ASRS v1.1 Screener (Part A) is considered positive if a client marks four or more responses in the shaded boxes, indicating a high probability of adult ADHD."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) on the BRIEF-A captures the ability to shift cognitive set and modulate emotions and behavior via appropriate inhibitory control and self-monitoring."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Conners 4 updated its clinical utility by including critical items for Self-Harm and Severe Conduct, allowing practitioners to immediately identify high-risk safety concerns during the assessment process."

            "question": "During a differential diagnosis screen, a practitioner uses the MDQ (Mood Disorder Questionnaire). If a client scores high on ADHD scales and the MDQ, what is the most critical clinical distinction to make?",
            "options": [
                "Whether the symptoms are episodic (Bipolar) or chronic/trait-like (ADHD).",
                "Which condition is more expensive to treat.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A primary differentiator between ADHD and Bipolar Disorder is the temporal nature of symptoms; ADHD is a neurodevelopmental trait (chronic), whereas Bipolar Disorder is characterized by distinct mood episodes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omission errors (failing to respond to a target) indicate that the individual is 'missing' the stimulus, which is a hallmark of inattention or a failure in sustained vigilance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The QbTest uses an infrared camera to track micro-movements (hyperactivity) during the test, providing an objective measure of motor activity that often correlates with the hyperactive-impulsive presentation."

            "id": "q20_9",

            "explanation": "The CGI-I is a 7-point scale where 1 is 'Very Much Improved,' 4 is 'No Change,' and 7 is 'Very Much Worse.' It is a gold-standard tool for longitudinal outcome measurement."

            "question": "A meta-analysis of the Vanderbilt Assessment Scales (n=14,000+) showed that while sensitivity for ADHD is high (~0.90), its specificity is lower (~0.60). What is the practical implication of this?",
            "options": [
                "The tool is excellent for 'ruling in' ADHD but may produce false positives in children with other disorders.",
                "The tool should never be used in clinical practice.",
                "The tool is only accurate for female patients.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High sensitivity means the tool rarely misses ADHD (few false negatives), but lower specificity means it may flag children with other conditions (like anxiety or ODD) as having ADHD (false positives), necessitating a careful differential diagnosis."
