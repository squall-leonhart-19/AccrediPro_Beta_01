            "question": "In the 'Triple Threat' profile (ADHD, Anxiety, and MDD), why is ADHD often the 'hidden' driver of treatment resistance in depression?",
            "options": [
                "Because ADHD medication neutralizes the effects of SSRIs",
                "Because executive dysfunction prevents the consistent application of CBT tools and lifestyle changes",
                "Because ADHD and MDD occupy the same receptors in the prefrontal cortex",
                "Because anxiety masks the hyperactivity associated with ADHD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Executive dysfunction (poor working memory, lack of task initiation) often prevents clients from following through on the very treatments meant to help their depression or anxiety, leading to a cycle of perceived failure."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which phenomenon describes the internal conflict of an 'AuDHD' client who simultaneously craves rigid routine for safety but requires high novelty to maintain dopamine levels?",
            "options": [
                "The Sensory-Processing Paradox",
                "The Executive Function Stalemate",

                "Hyper-Systemizing ADHD"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Routine-Novelty Tug-of-War' is a hallmark of the AuDHD profile, where the ADHD side of the brain seeks stimulation while the Autistic side seeks predictability, often leading to rapid burnout."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female executive is diagnosed with ADHD after a lifetime of high achievement. She reports 'feeling like a fraud' and intense exhaustion. This is a classic example of:",

                "Malingering"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-functioning masking involves using high intelligence or anxiety to compensate for executive deficits, which results in a massive 'allostatic load' (wear and tear on the body/brain) and late-diagnosis trauma."

            "options": [
                "A desire for recreational euphoria",
                "An attempt to quiet 'mental noise' and achieve focus or emotional regulation",

                "Social pressure within the ADHD community"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that many ADHD individuals with SUD are attempting to 'self-medicate' their under-stimulated prefrontal cortex to achieve a sense of normalcy or quiet their racing thoughts."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While both involve impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, BPD is specifically characterized by an unstable sense of self and an intense fear of abandonment, which are not core ADHD traits."

            "options": [
                "Increased progesterone causes hyperactivity",
                "Falling estrogen levels lead to a decrease in dopamine receptor sensitivity and availability",

                "Cortisol levels drop, leading to lethargy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a key role in dopamine production and receptor sensitivity. As estrogen drops during perimenopause/menopause, ADHD symptoms often become significantly more severe and less responsive to previous medication doses."

                "The inability to delegate tasks to subordinates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Executive Function Debt occurs when a professional uses extreme effort to 'mask' or perform at a high level during work hours, leading to total collapse, irritability, or inability to function in their personal life."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client who has been making progress for six months suddenly stops using their systems and misses three appointments. How should a specialist interpret this 'Regression'?",
            "options": [
                "As a sign that the client is no longer motivated to change",
                "As a normal part of the non-linear ADHD journey, often triggered by increased life stress or 'optimization fatigue'",
                "As evidence that the initial diagnosis was incorrect",
                "As a failure of the coaching methodology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progress in ADHD management is non-linear. Regression is often 'optimization fatigue' or a sign that the client's current environmental demands have exceeded their current coping capacity."

            "question": "Research on ADHD and SUD shows that treating ADHD with appropriate stimulant medication actually _______ the risk of future substance abuse in ADHD populations.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple longitudinal studies and meta-analyses show that effectively treating ADHD with stimulants reduces the risk of substance use disorders by addressing the underlying neurobiological deficit."

                "The client feels too much empathy for others and burns out",
                "A breakdown in communication where both the neurotypical and neurodivergent person fail to understand each other's perspective",
                "The specialist feeling more empathy for the ADHD traits than the Autistic traits",
                "The client having two different types of empathy for two different people"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communication breakdowns between neurodivergent and neurotypical people are a two-way street, rather than a 'deficit' solely belonging to the neurodivergent individual."
