            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that in ADHD, the Default Mode Network (DMN)—responsible for mind-wandering—fails to suppress properly when the Task-Positive Network or Central Executive Network is engaged, leading to attentional lapses."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stimulants are highly effective with large effect sizes usually ranging from 0.9 to 1.0, while non-stimulants, though effective, typically show moderate effect sizes around 0.6 to 0.7."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FDA clearance was based on data from five clinical studies, including a randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing objective improvements in attentional control (TOVA scores)."

                "The treatment is highly effective and should be recommended",
                "The result is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level",
                "The result is not statistically significant, as it exceeds the standard 0.05 threshold",
                "The p-value is too low to draw any conclusions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.08 is greater than the standard 0.05 threshold, meaning the results could likely have occurred by chance and are not considered statistically significant."

            "question": "A client presents a study claiming a new supplement has an 'Effect Size of 0.2.' Based on clinical research standards, how should you describe this to the client?",

                "This is a 'Large' effect, comparable to stimulant medication",
                "This is a 'Moderate' effect, showing significant clinical promise",
                "This is a 'Small' effect, which may not result in noticeable clinical improvement",
                "Effect sizes of 0.2 are considered 'Negative' and the supplement is harmful"

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to Cohen's benchmarks, an effect size of 0.2 is considered 'small,' 0.5 is 'medium,' and 0.8 or higher is 'large.' A 0.2 effect size suggests a very subtle impact."
