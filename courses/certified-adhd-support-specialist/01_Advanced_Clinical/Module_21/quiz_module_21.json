            "options": [
                "Neurotransmitter dysregulation in the prefrontal cortex",
                "Individual cognitive distortions regarding self-worth",
                "Workplace environmental demands and cultural expectations",
                "Executive function deficits in working memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Social domain encompasses the external environment, including workplace accommodations, family dynamics, and societal expectations, whereas biological and psychological factors focus on internal mechanisms."

            "question": "The Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA) indicated that while medication effectively manages core symptoms, behavioral interventions are superior for which outcome?",

                "Extending the duration of sustained attention on repetitive tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTA study found that multimodal treatment (meds + behavioral) yielded the best results for functional outcomes like social skills and family relations, which medication alone often fails to address."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In the SMART-EF framework, what does the 'EF' specifically require the practitioner to evaluate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'EF' component ensures that goals are realistic by identifying which executive function (e.g., task initiation, working memory) is required and how to support it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurologically, a state of dysregulation (high stress/anxiety) inhibits the prefrontal cortex's ability to learn and implement the complex cognitive strategies required for organization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental scaffolding involves 'externalizing' the brain—using visible cues, timers, and organized spaces to compensate for internal executive function deficits."

                "24 to 48 hours",
                "Exactly 7 days",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A period of 2-4 weeks allows for the initial 'novelty effect' to wear off and provides enough data points to see if the intervention is sustainable across different contexts."

                "504 Plans require a student to be in special education classes",

                "IEPs are only for students with physical disabilities",
                "504 Plans do not have any legal standing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 504 Plan is a civil rights provision that focuses on removing barriers to learning through accommodations (like extra time), whereas an IEP provides specialized, individualized instruction."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Friction Audit' helps identify potential relapse points in a new environment, allowing for the proactive creation of scaffolding before the client becomes overwhelmed."

                "Medication alone is 100% effective for all ADHD patients",
                "Combined treatment allows for lower doses of medication while maintaining symptom control",
                "Behavioral therapy has no effect if the patient is not on stimulants",
                "Treatment planning should only focus on the child, as parents have no impact on outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that combining behavioral therapy with medication often allows for a 'lower effective dose' of medication, reducing side effects while optimizing functional outcomes."
