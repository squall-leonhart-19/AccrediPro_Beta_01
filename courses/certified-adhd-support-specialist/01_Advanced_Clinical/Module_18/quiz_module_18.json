            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "When synthesizing a holistic assessment (L1), why is it critical to map the intersection of 'Executive Function' and 'Emotional Dysregulation'?",
            "options": [
                "Because executive functions like working memory and inhibition are the primary drivers of emotional modulation.",
                "Because they are biologically unrelated and must be treated as separate comorbid conditions.",
                "To ensure the client receives two different diagnostic codes for insurance purposes.",
                "Only to determine if the client requires stimulant vs. non-stimulant medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Holistic assessment recognizes that ADHD is not just a cognitive deficit; executive functions provide the 'top-down' regulation required to manage emotional 'bottom-up' impulses."

        {
            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "According to the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA) discussed in L2, what was a primary benefit of the 'Integrated Framework' (Combined Treatment)?",
            "options": [
                "It showed that behavioral therapy alone was superior to medication in all cases.",
                "It demonstrated that combined treatment allowed for lower medication dosages while maintaining high efficacy.",
                "It proved that psychosocial interventions have no impact on core ADHD symptoms.",
                "It found that 100% of participants reached full remission within six months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTA study found that while medication is highly effective for core symptoms, combined treatment (Medication + Behavioral) often allows for lower doses and addresses functional impairments more broadly."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "In the 'Resilience-Based Model' (L3), which factor is defined as the internal moderator that most significantly predicts long-term success despite ADHD challenges?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-efficacy is a core pillar of resilience in ADHD, as it bridges the gap between 'knowing what to do' and 'doing what you know' through persistent effort."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The systemic ecosystem recognizes that ADHD symptoms manifest and are managed within a complex environment involving multiple stakeholders and structural barriers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lifespan trajectories show that while overt hyperactivity often declines, it frequently transforms into subjective feelings of inner restlessness and more complex executive function failures."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference in ADHD work often involves the practitioner 'acting out' the roles missing in the client's life, such as the 'rescuer' or the 'punitive authority figure.'"

                "A small effect size with little clinical significance.",
                "A moderate effect size common in nutritional interventions.",
                "A large effect size, indicating the intervention has a robust impact.",
                "An error in data collection."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In clinical research, a Cohen's d of 0.80 or higher is considered a 'large' effect size, indicating a substantial difference between the treatment and control groups."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Evidence-Based Practice' (EBP) and 'Practice-Based Evidence' (PBE) as taught in L8?",
            "options": [
                "EBP uses research to guide practice; PBE uses clinical data from the practitioner's own work to refine their approach.",
                "EBP is for doctors, while PBE is for coaches and support specialists.",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms.",
                "PBE is considered unscientific and should be avoided in professional mastery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Professional mastery requires a synthesis of both: applying external research (EBP) and systematically tracking one's own clinical outcomes (PBE) to improve performance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis requires addressing both the internal emotional experience (RSD) and the external environment (workplace) to create a sustainable outcome."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthesis of research shows that collaborative, shared decision-making increases the client's sense of agency and significantly improves long-term adherence to multimodal plans."
