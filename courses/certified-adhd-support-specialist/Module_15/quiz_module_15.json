            "question": "When differentiating between ADHD and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which clinical feature is most characteristic of BPD rather than ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Impulsive spending and poor financial management",
                "Chronic feelings of emptiness and a frantic effort to avoid real or imagined abandonment",
                "Emotional dysregulation following a perceived slight or rejection",
                "Difficulty sustaining attention during non-preferred tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both share impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, the 'frantic effort to avoid abandonment' and 'chronic emptiness' are core diagnostic criteria for BPD (Cluster B) and are not standard features of ADHD."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A 52-year-old female client reports that her ADHD stimulant medication has become significantly less effective over the last 12 months. Based on Module 15, L2, what physiological factor is likely responsible?",
            "options": [
                "Development of pharmacological tolerance to methylphenidate",
                "A decrease in circulating estrogen, which acts as a modulator for dopamine receptor sensitivity",
                "Age-related decline in liver enzyme activity slowing drug metabolism",
                "The natural progression of ADHD into early-onset dementia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is neuroprotective and modulates dopamine. During perimenopause and menopause, declining estrogen levels can lead to a significant decrease in dopamine efficacy, often requiring a titration or hormonal HRT adjunct."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "High-performing executives with ADHD often utilize 'Anxiety-Driven Productivity.' What is the primary risk of this compensatory strategy according to the course content?",
            "options": [
                "It leads to a permanent increase in IQ scores",
                "It results in 'Adrenal Burnout' and a sudden collapse in executive function after years of high output",
                "It eliminates the need for pharmacological intervention",
                "It prevents the development of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-achievers often use cortisol and adrenaline (stress) to bypass executive function deficits. This 'over-functioning' is unsustainable and typically leads to significant burnout or physical health issues in mid-life."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "In advanced pharmacotherapy, what is the primary benefit of adding an Alpha-2 Agonist (like Guanfacine) to a stimulant protocol?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the 'rush' felt by stimulants to improve motivation",
                "It acts as a sedative to ensure the client sleeps through the night",
                "It strengthens the 'signal' of the prefrontal cortex while reducing 'noise' (distractibility and hyperactivity)",
                "It blocks the absorption of dopamine in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha-2 agonists work postsynaptically in the prefrontal cortex to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, often smoothing out the 'edges' of stimulants and improving emotional regulation."

            "id": "q15_5",

            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 35-40%",

                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that up to 75-80% of adults with ADHD have a circadian rhythm disruption known as Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder, where their internal clock is shifted 2-3 hours later than the societal norm."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "What is the 'masking effect' in Twice-Exceptional (2e) individuals?",

                "Using physical masks to hide facial tics",
                "High intelligence compensating for ADHD deficits, resulting in 'average' performance that hides the person's true potential and their disability",

                "The use of stimulants to hide the symptoms of giftedness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In 2e individuals, the high IQ 'masks' the ADHD deficits, and the ADHD 'masks' the high IQ. This often leads to the individual being overlooked for support because they perform at 'grade level' despite significant internal struggle."

            "id": "q15_7",

            "options": [
                "Eliminating all deadlines for the employee",
                "Allowing the use of noise-canceling headphones and a flexible start time (within reason)",

                "Promoting the employee to a management position to reduce their paperwork"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reasonable accommodations are adjustments that allow the employee to perform the 'essential functions' of the job without causing 'undue hardship' to the employer. Noise-canceling headphones and flexible scheduling are standard examples."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "How does Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) typically differ from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in terms of duration and onset?",
            "options": [
                "RSD lasts for months, while MDD lasts for hours",
                "RSD is always triggered by an event and resolves quickly (minutes to hours), while MDD is often persistent regardless of external events",
                "There is no difference; RSD is simply a modern name for MDD",
                "RSD only occurs in children, while MDD only occurs in adults"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is characterized by intense, episodic emotional pain triggered by a specific event (real or perceived rejection). Unlike MDD, which is a pervasive mood state, RSD episodes are relatively short-lived but extremely intense."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In the context of 'Andropause' and ADHD, a decline in bioavailable testosterone in men is most closely linked to an increase in which symptom?",
            "options": [
                "Improved focus and calm",
                "Hyperactive-impulsive behaviors",
                "Executive dysfunction, 'brain fog,' and reduced spatial memory",
                "Increased efficacy of stimulant medications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Declining testosterone in aging men can exacerbate ADHD symptoms, specifically increasing 'brain fog' and reducing the executive capacity to manage complex tasks and spatial information."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which neurological structure is increasingly implicated in the 'bottom-up' emotional flooding seen in Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria?",
            "options": [
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Thalamus and its inability to filter emotional stimuli before they reach the Amygdala",
                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Pituitary Gland"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Current theories suggest that in RSD, the thalamus fails to properly filter perceived social threats, leading to an immediate and overwhelming 'flooding' of the amygdala and the limbic system."
