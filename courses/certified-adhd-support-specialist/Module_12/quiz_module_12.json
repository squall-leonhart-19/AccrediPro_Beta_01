            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiology of sleep in ADHD, research indicates that approximately 75% of adults with ADHD exhibit a 'delayed sleep phase' characterized by a melatonin onset shift of how long compared to neurotypical controls?",
            "options": [
                "15 to 30 minutes",
                "45 to 60 minutes",
                "90 to 120 minutes",
                "Over 4 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies show that individuals with ADHD often experience a circadian rhythm delay where endogenous melatonin levels do not rise until 1.5 to 2 hours later than the neurotypical average."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS) in ADHD is linked to 'leaky' sensory gating. Which brain structure is primarily responsible for this failure to filter out irrelevant environmental stimuli?",
            "options": [
                "Thalamus",
                "Occipital Lobe",
                "Cerebellum",
                "Hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Thalamus acts as the 'relay station' or gatekeeper of the brain; in ADHD and SPS, it fails to inhibit non-essential sensory information, leading to sensory overload."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, why do many ADHD patients experience a significant 'rebound' of symptoms and reduced medication efficacy?",
            "options": [
                "High progesterone causes excessive dopamine clearance",
                "Estrogen levels drop, reducing dopamine synthesis and receptor sensitivity",
                "Testosterone spikes interfere with stimulant absorption",
                "Cortisol levels stabilize, masking the effects of dopamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a neuroprotective modulator that promotes dopamine synthesis. When it drops sharply before menstruation, dopamine levels plummet, often rendering standard stimulant doses less effective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is neurobiologically distinct from Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) because RSD is characterized by:",
            "options": [
                "A slow build-up of dread regarding future social events",
                "An intense, sudden emotional 'flash' or 'crash' in response to perceived rejection",
                "A primary fear of being scrutinized by strangers",
                "Physical symptoms like sweating and shaking that precede the social interaction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD is characterized by its suddenness and intensity (emotional dysregulation), whereas SAD involves anticipatory anxiety and a persistent fear of judgment."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'Digital Overload,' how do variable ratio reinforcement schedules on social media affect the ADHD brain's dopamine levels?",
            "options": [
                "They stabilize tonic dopamine levels for better focus",
                "They create frequent phasic dopamine spikes that deplete the baseline (tonic) pool",
                "They increase the density of D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex",
                "They have no effect on dopamine, only on serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The unpredictability of 'likes' and 'notifications' creates phasic spikes that provide temporary reward but eventually lower the baseline (tonic) dopamine level, leading to the 'dopamine crash' and increased ADHD symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "When advocating for workplace accommodations under the ADA, which of the following would likely be considered a 'reasonable accommodation' for an ADHD employee?",
            "options": [
                "Removing all essential job functions from the employee's description",
                "Providing a quiet workspace or noise-canceling headphones to mitigate sensory distractions",
                "Allowing the employee to miss all deadlines without consequence",
                "Hiring a second employee to perform the ADHD employee's administrative tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reasonable accommodations must allow the employee to perform 'essential functions' without causing 'undue hardship.' Environmental modifications like noise-canceling headphones are standard reasonable accommodations."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Longitudinal data suggests that what percentage of adults with ADHD will experience a comorbid internalizing disorder, such as Major Depressive Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "Up to 70-80%",
                "Less than 5%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in ADHD; studies indicate that 70-80% of adults with ADHD will struggle with at least one internalizing disorder in their lifetime."
        },

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Which specific protein, often called 'brain fertilizer,' is upregulated through aerobic exercise and is critical for neuroplasticity and cognitive maintenance in ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Amyloid Beta",
                "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)",
                "Hemoglobin",
                "C-Reactive Protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BDNF supports the survival of existing neurons and encourages the growth of new neurons and synapses, making it vital for long-term ADHD management."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client with ADHD and RSD finds that cognitive-behavioral tools alone are insufficient for managing the 'physical pain' of rejection. Which pharmacological class is often used off-label to specifically target the alpha-2 receptors involved in RSD?",
            "options": [
                "Benzodiazepines",
                "SSRIs",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha-2 agonists like Guanfacine and Clonidine are often effective for the emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity associated with ADHD by modulating the prefrontal cortex."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "To facilitate neuroplasticity and long-term maintenance, what is the 'Gold Standard' approach for treating adult ADHD according to current clinical guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulant medication alone",
                "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) alone",
                "A multimodal approach combining medication, psychoeducation, and environmental supports",
                "Elimination diets and herbal supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The multimodal approach is the most effective, as it addresses the biological, psychological, and social/environmental aspects of the disorder simultaneously."
