            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "According to Russell Barkley’s Executive Functioning Model, what is the 'anchor' or primary deficit that prevents the other four executive functions from operating effectively?",
            "options": [
                "Working Memory",
                "Behavioral Inhibition",
                "Emotional Self-Regulation",
                "Reconstitution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Barkley posits that Behavioral Inhibition is the foundational deficit; without the ability to 'stop' an initial response, the other executive functions (working memory, self-regulation, etc.) cannot be engaged to guide behavior."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In the context of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), how does the emotional response typically differ from clinical depression?",
            "options": [
                "RSD is a slow-onset, long-lasting mood state.",
                "RSD is always triggered by a specific, perceived event and resolves quickly.",
                "RSD is unrelated to the dopamine system.",
                "RSD only occurs in childhood ADHD cases."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike the 'leaden paralysis' of depression which can last weeks, RSD is characterized by intense, episodic emotional 'flashes' triggered by perceived rejection or failure, often resolving as quickly as they began."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on ADHD comorbidities found that approximately what percentage of adults with ADHD present with at least one other psychiatric condition?",
            "options": [
                "25-30%",
                "45-50%",
                "Around 80%",
                "Exactly 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in adult ADHD, with approximately 80% of adults having at least one co-occurring disorder, such as anxiety, depression, or SUD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) suggests that the ADHD brain has a specific dysfunction in the 'Reward Circuit.' Which neurobiological feature is most associated with this?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive serotonin in the synapse",
                "Reduced density or sensitivity of D2 dopamine receptors",
                "Overactive prefrontal cortex",
                "Increased GABA production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RDS is characterized by a lack of 'tonic' dopamine and reduced D2 receptor availability, leading individuals to seek 'high-stimulation' activities to reach a baseline level of reward satisfaction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Regarding ADHD across the lifespan, how does the manifestation of hyperactivity typically change as a child moves into adulthood?",
            "options": [
                "It disappears entirely by age 18.",
                "It shifts from external motor activity to internal restlessness and 'mental hyperactivity.'",
                "It increases in intensity, leading to more physical risk-taking.",
                "It transforms into a preference for sedentary lifestyles."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While overt physical hyperactivity (running, climbing) often declines with age, it typically morphs into 'internalized' restlessness, racing thoughts, or an inability to relax."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is prevalent in up to 75% of the ADHD population. What is the physiological hallmark of this condition?",
            "options": [
                "A 2-hour or more delay in the circadian rhythm and melatonin onset.",
                "An inability to enter REM sleep.",
                "Waking up 3 hours earlier than intended.",
                "Chronic sleep apnea caused by stimulants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "DSPS in ADHD involves a significant shift in the circadian clock, where the natural 'dim light melatonin onset' (DLMO) occurs much later than in the neurotypical population."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to Cognitive Load Theory, which type of load should a specialist aim to REDUCE when designing a workspace for a client with ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Intrinsic Load",
                "Germane Load",
                "Extraneous Load",
                "Critical Load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extraneous load refers to unnecessary cognitive demands (like a cluttered environment or poorly explained instructions) that distract from the actual task at hand."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "The concept of 'Time Blindness' implies that individuals with ADHD primarily live in which two 'time zones'?",
            "options": [
                "Past and Future",
                "Now and Not Now",
                "Morning and Night",
                "Productive and Unproductive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Russell Barkley describes 'Time Blindness' as a 'Now vs. Not Now' dichotomy, where the ADHD brain struggles to prioritize or feel the urgency of tasks that are not in the immediate present."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'Mark' is a 35-year-old executive who excels in crises but cannot finish routine reports. Using the Reward Deficiency Syndrome model, why does Mark excel in a crisis?",
            "options": [
                "Crisis environments provide the high-dopamine 'phasic' spikes his brain requires for focus.",
                "He has a higher-than-average baseline of dopamine.",
                "Crisis environments reduce his sensory processing sensitivity.",
                "He is using his superior working memory to solve problems."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-stakes or 'crisis' situations trigger significant dopamine release, which temporarily 'fixes' the reward deficiency, allowing the ADHD brain to engage and focus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which intervention best addresses the 'Point of Performance' as described in Barkley's model?",
            "options": [
                "Weekly talk therapy to discuss childhood origins of ADHD.",
                "Placing a physical timer and a visual checklist directly on the desk where the work happens.",
                "Reading a book about the history of ADHD.",
                "Setting a goal to be more organized by the end of the year."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Barkley argues that because ADHD is a 'performance disorder,' interventions must be 'at the point of performance'—externalizing information and cues exactly where and when the behavior is needed."
