            "question": "In the 'Neuro-Architecture' of the ADHD brain, which specific functional deficit is most closely associated with the inability to hold and manipulate information in mind over short periods?",
            "options": [
                "Hypoactivation of the Basal Ganglia",
                "Deficits in Working Memory within the Prefrontal Cortex",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working memory, localized primarily in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), is the 'mental workspace' that allows for the temporary storage and manipulation of information, a core executive function deficit in ADHD."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is characterized by an intense emotional response to perceived criticism. Which neurological structure is hypothesized to be hyper-reactive in individuals experiencing RSD?",

                "The Cerebellum",
                "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)",
                "The Medulla Oblongata",
                "The Primary Visual Cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is involved in processing the 'emotional' component of pain and social rejection; in ADHD/RSD, this area often shows heightened sensitivity."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Research into Circadian Biology indicates that approximately 75-80% of adults with ADHD experience 'Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome' (DSPS). What is the primary physiological marker of this condition?",
            "options": [
                "An inability to enter REM sleep regardless of timing",

                "Excessive production of cortisol at 10:00 PM",
                "A total lack of Adenosine buildup throughout the day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DSPS in ADHD is marked by a circadian rhythm shift where melatonin—the hormone signaling sleep—is released significantly later than in neurotypical individuals."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In women and AFAB individuals, how does the fluctuation of estrogen during the luteal phase typically affect ADHD symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Rising estrogen increases dopamine, making symptoms disappear",
                "Falling estrogen levels correlate with decreased dopamine efficacy, worsening symptoms",
                "Estrogen has no known interaction with dopamine or ADHD",
                "Progesterone increases focus and counteracts all ADHD executive dysfunction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen facilitates dopamine synthesis and receptor sensitivity. When estrogen drops during the luteal phase, dopamine efficacy decreases, often rendering ADHD medications less effective and worsening symptoms."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "A client is struggling with 'task initiation' in an open-office environment. Which workplace accommodation is specifically designed to provide external 'pacing' and accountability?",
            "options": [
                "Noise-canceling headphones",
                "Ergonomic seating",

                "Increased lighting in the workspace"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Body doubling is a productivity strategy where the presence of another person helps an individual with ADHD stay anchored to a task and improve initiation."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "When ADHD and Autism (AuDHD) co-occur, what is a common 'internal conflict' reported by clients regarding their executive function needs?",
            "options": [
                "A simultaneous need for novelty (ADHD) and a rigid need for sameness (Autism)",
                "A complete lack of sensory processing issues",
                "An inability to experience hyperfocus in any capacity",
                "Hyper-socialization combined with a lack of verbal communication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'AuDHD' paradox involves the ADHD brain's drive for dopamine-seeking novelty clashing with the Autistic brain's need for predictability and routine."

                "The Bystander Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Zeigarnik Effect is the tendency to remember interrupted or incomplete tasks better than completed ones, which digital interfaces exploit to keep users engaged."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 2021 study on ADHD and technology found that individuals with ADHD are at a higher risk for 'Problematic Internet Use' (PIU). What is the primary neurobiological driver for this?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital platforms use variable-ratio reinforcement (like slot machines), which provides the intermittent dopamine hits that the ADHD brain is neurologically primed to seek."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "When distinguishing between Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and ADHD-related anxiety, which factor is most indicative of ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "The anxiety is constant and unrelated to specific tasks",
                "The anxiety is primarily a 'secondary' symptom of executive function failures (e.g., fear of missing deadlines)",
                "The anxiety is relieved by avoiding all social contact",
                "The anxiety is characterized by physical tremors and high blood pressure only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD-related anxiety is often 'situational' or 'secondary,' arising from a history of executive function failures, whereas GAD is often 'free-floating' and persists regardless of task performance."
