            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ADA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations unless doing so causes 'undue hardship,' which refers to significant difficulty or expense relative to the employer's resources."

                "The ADHD partner assumes all household responsibilities to overcompensate for their symptoms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This dynamic is common when executive dysfunction leads one partner to handle all logistics, resulting in resentment for the 'parent' partner and a sense of shame or rebellion for the 'child' partner."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine. When estrogen drops during the luteal phase, dopamine availability decreases, often making ADHD symptoms more severe and medications less effective."

                "It triggers a consistent, low-level release of serotonin that induces sleep.",
                "The unpredictability of the 'reward' (likes/notifications) creates a dopamine loop that is harder for an ADHD brain to exit.",
                "It requires high levels of sustained attention that ADHD individuals lack."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Variable rewards are the most addictive reinforcement schedule. For ADHD brains seeking dopamine, the 'gamified' nature of social media creates a feedback loop that is difficult to break."
