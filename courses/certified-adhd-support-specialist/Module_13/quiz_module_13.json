            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological models discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary structural deficit contributing to emotional dysregulation in ADHD?",
            "options": [
                "Over-activity of the hippocampus during memory retrieval",
                "Weak functional connectivity between the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and the Amygdala",
                "Excessive dopamine production in the ventral striatum",
                "Atrophy of the occipital lobe affecting visual perception of emotions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'top-down' regulation failure in ADHD is primarily due to weak functional connectivity between the PFC (the brakes) and the amygdala (the emotional center), leading to unfiltered emotional responses."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), as explored in Lesson 2, is best described as:",
            "options": [
                "A slow-building resentment toward authority figures",
                "A social anxiety disorder characterized by fear of public speaking",
                "An intense, agonizing emotional pain triggered by perceived or actual rejection or criticism",
                "A personality trait associated with narcissism and entitlement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RSD is a specific symptom of ADHD characterized by extreme emotional sensitivity and pain triggered by the perception—not necessarily the reality—of being rejected or criticized."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "What is the key clinical differentiator between ADHD-related 'Affective Lability' and Bipolar Disorder mood shifts?",
            "options": [
                "ADHD shifts are usually triggered by external events and last minutes to hours, while Bipolar shifts are often autonomous and last days to weeks",
                "ADHD mood shifts only occur in childhood, whereas Bipolar shifts only occur in adulthood",
                "Bipolar shifts are always triggered by sleep deprivation, while ADHD shifts are not",
                "There is no clinical difference; they are the same physiological phenomenon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ADHD emotionality is typically reactive (triggered) and short-lived (transient), whereas Bipolar Disorder involves episodic shifts in mood that persist for days or weeks regardless of external triggers."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies (n=1,450) cited in the module found that what percentage of adults with ADHD manifest significant emotional dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Approximately 35-40%",

                "Nearly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 70-80% of adults with ADHD experience significant emotional dysregulation, leading many experts to propose it be included in the diagnostic criteria."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "How does a deficit in 'Working Memory' (an Executive Function) specifically impact emotional regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the individual to forget their own name during an argument",
                "It prevents the individual from holding a 'calming thought' or future consequence in mind while experiencing an emotion",
                "It leads to a total loss of long-term memories from childhood",
                "It results in the inability to recognize faces (prosopagnosia)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working memory allows us to hold self-soothing talk or the memory of past consequences in mind. When it fails, the current emotion fills the entire 'mental workspace,' leading to flooding."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Negative Sentiment Override' in ADHD relationships refers to:",
            "options": [
                "A software glitch in ADHD coaching apps",
                "The tendency for a partner to interpret even neutral or positive actions as negative due to a history of ADHD-related conflict",
                "The ADHD brain's inability to process negative words",
                "A state where the ADHD individual refuses to speak to their partner"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Negative Sentiment Override occurs when the accumulation of ADHD-related stressors leads a partner to view even benign behaviors through a lens of resentment or suspicion."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Which 'TIPP' skill from Lesson 6 is most effective for immediate physiological de-escalation during an 'amygdala hijack'?",
            "options": [
                "Talking through the problem with a friend",
                "Temperature (e.g., splashing cold water on the face to trigger the mammalian dive reflex)",
                "Thinking about a positive vacation memory",
                "Taking a nap"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'T' in TIPP stands for Temperature. Using cold water changes the body chemistry quickly by triggering the mammalian dive reflex, which lowers the heart rate and breaks the emotional flood."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 7, why are Alpha-2 agonists like Guanfacine or Clonidine often prescribed for ADHD emotional symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "They are powerful stimulants that increase focus",
                "They act as sedatives that force the patient to sleep",
                "They strengthen the PFC's ability to regulate the amygdala by mimicking norepinephrine at the synapse",
                "They inhibit the digestion of sugar to prevent mood swings"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha-2 agonists work by strengthening the signal in the prefrontal cortex, effectively 'tuning' the PFC to better manage the emotional signals coming from the limbic system."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "When developing a 'Personalized Emotional Resilience Plan' (Lesson 8), what is the purpose of identifying 'Early Warning Signs'?",
            "options": [
                "To punish the client for getting angry",
                "To catch the emotional arousal at a '2 or 3' out of 10 before it reaches a '9 or 10' where executive function is lost",
                "To predict when the client will lose their job",
                "To document symptoms for insurance purposes only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying early signs (like jaw clenching or foot tapping) allows the individual to deploy coping strategies while their 'Executive Function Filter' is still online."

            "question": "Case Study: Mark is an ADHD professional who feels 'paralyzed' for hours after receiving a minor correction on a report. He feels 'worthless' and 'hated' by his boss. Which concept from the module best explains Mark's reaction?",
            "options": [
                "Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)",
                "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)",
                "Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)",
                "Lack of professional ambition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mark's extreme, paralyzing reaction to a minor critique, characterized by feelings of worthlessness, is a classic presentation of Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)."
