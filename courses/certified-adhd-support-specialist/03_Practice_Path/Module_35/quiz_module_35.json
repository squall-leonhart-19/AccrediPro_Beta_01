            "question": "When shifting from a Solo Practitioner to a Practice Director mindset, what is the primary metric that defines success in the scaling phase?",
            "options": [
                "Total number of direct clinical hours billed by the founder",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires decoupling the founder's time from revenue. The Founder-Independence Ratio measures how well the systems and team function without the founder's direct clinical labor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "ADHD clients often require high-touch administrative support (reminders, scheduling, onboarding). A Success Manager protects the Lead Coach's time, allowing them to focus on high-value interventions."
