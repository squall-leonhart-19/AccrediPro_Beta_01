            "question": "According to the 'Niche Specificity' framework in Lesson 1, why is targeting a 'general ADHD' audience often less effective than a micro-niche like 'ADHD for Female Entrepreneurs'?",
            "options": [
                "Generalist marketing increases decision fatigue and reduces perceived expertise",
                "Broad niches are legally required to have clinical oversight",

                "Most ADHD clients prefer to work with generalists to avoid stigma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that micro-niching reduces the 'paradox of choice' for clients with executive dysfunction and establishes the practitioner as a specialist, allowing for higher premium pricing."

                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance",
                "It ensures that clients pay exactly the same amount regardless of their progress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the transformation and results provided to the client, which allows the practitioner to increase revenue without necessarily increasing their working hours."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To remain ethically and legally compliant, support specialists focus on executive function strategies, lifestyle support, and functional goals rather than clinical diagnosis or medical treatment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD-friendly marketing must accommodate executive function challenges. 'Chunking' information makes it easier to process and reduces the likelihood of the client becoming overwhelmed and abandoning the page."
