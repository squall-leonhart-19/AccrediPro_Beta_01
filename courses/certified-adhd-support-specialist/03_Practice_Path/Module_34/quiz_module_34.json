            "question": "According to Yalom’s therapeutic factors applied to ADHD groups, which factor is most effective at reducing the 'shame-secrecy' cycle regarding executive dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Interpersonal learning", "Universality", "Catharsis", "Existential factors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality allows ADHD clients to realize they are not alone in their struggles, which is the primary antidote to the chronic shame associated with executive function failures."
        },

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a curriculum for ADHD adults (L2), what is the recommended maximum duration for a single instructional 'content block' before requiring a transition or activity?",
            "options": ["30-40 minutes", "5-10 minutes", "12-15 minutes", "20-25 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into ADHD cognitive load suggests that 'scaffolding' content into 12-15 minute micro-segments prevents 'zoning out' and improves retention compared to longer lectures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A participant in your group constantly interrupts others with tangential stories. According to Advanced Facilitation techniques (L3), which is the most effective intervention?",
            "options": ["Muting their microphone immediately without warning", "The 'Parking Lot' method to validate the thought while deferring it", "Ignoring the interruption to maintain the group flow", "Ending the session early to address the behavior privately"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Parking Lot' technique visually or verbally validates the participant's contribution (reducing rejection sensitivity) while maintaining the structural integrity of the lesson."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In virtual workshop logistics (L4), 'Zoom Fatigue' is more pronounced in ADHD populations. What specific strategy is recommended to mitigate this?",
            "options": ["Mandatory 'cameras on' policy for the entire 2 hours", "Using a single static slide for the whole presentation", "Scheduled 5-minute 'sensory breaks' every 45-50 minutes", "Providing a 50-page PDF manual to read during the session"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scheduled sensory or movement breaks help ADHD participants regulate their arousal levels and maintain focus during virtual sessions."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Body Doubling' in group models. Why is this model particularly effective for ADHD clients?",
            "options": ["It provides a competitive environment that increases adrenaline", "It utilizes 'Social Facilitation' to lower the activation energy required for boring tasks", "It removes the need for any executive function planning", "It is a form of deep-tissue therapy for physical restlessness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body doubling leverages social facilitation; the mere presence of others working toward a similar goal helps ADHD brains initiate and sustain effort on low-stimulation tasks."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "When marketing a specialized workshop for ADHD Executives (L6), which value proposition is most likely to convert based on the lesson's data?",
            "options": ["'A journey into your childhood roots of ADHD'", "'Managing your emotions through finger painting'", "'ROI-driven systems for 10x output and cognitive energy management'", "'A 24-week slow-paced introductory course'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD Executives typically respond to high-level, efficiency-focused language that emphasizes 'ROI' (Return on Investment) and practical systems over long-term therapeutic exploration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "To measure the efficacy of an ADHD group program (L7), which metric provides the most objective data regarding executive function improvement?",
            "options": ["The 'Net Promoter Score' (NPS)", "Pre- and post-program scores on the BRIEF-A (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function)", "The total number of likes on the group's Facebook page", "The facilitator's subjective feeling of the group's energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validated psychometric scales like the BRIEF-A provide standardized data on specific executive functions, making them superior for measuring clinical efficacy compared to subjective satisfaction scores."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis mentioned in Lesson 7 found that group-based ADHD interventions yielded an average effect size (Cohen's d) of approximately:",
            "options": ["0.15 (Negligible)", "0.30 (Small)", "0.65 (Moderate-to-Large)", "1.50 (Extreme)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses of ADHD group coaching and CBT programs typically show moderate-to-large effect sizes (0.60 to 0.70) for symptom reduction and quality of life improvements."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "In the 'Collaborative Accountability' model (L5), what is the 'Goldilocks' number of participants for a peer-support breakout room?",
            "options": ["2-3 participants", "10-12 participants", "Exactly 1 participant", "15-20 participants"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Small groups of 2-3 maximize 'air time' and prevent ADHD participants from 'hiding' or becoming overwhelmed by too many simultaneous social inputs."

        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "When scaling your impact (L8), what is the primary benefit of using a 'Waitlist Strategy' for an ADHD program launch?",
            "options": ["It allows the facilitator to go on vacation longer", "It creates 'positive friction' and urgency while allowing for pre-launch nurturing", "It guarantees that 100% of people on the list will buy", "It hides the fact that the program isn't ready yet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Waitlists create urgency and allow the facilitator to send 'priming' content to prospects, which is essential for ADHD clients who may need multiple reminders to take action on a purchase."
