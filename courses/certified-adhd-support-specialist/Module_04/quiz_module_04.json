            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Structural neuroimaging studies have consistently identified reduced volume and delayed maturation in which specific region of the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) responsible for inhibitory control in ADHD patients?",
            "options": [
                "Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus",
                "Left Occipital Lobe",
                "Primary Somatosensory Cortex",
                "Superior Temporal Gyrus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus is a critical node for 'top-down' inhibitory control. Meta-analyses show this region consistently exhibits reduced activation and volume in individuals with ADHD compared to neurotypical controls."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the neurochemical 'Signal-to-Noise' model of ADHD, what is the specific role of Norepinephrine (NE) at the Alpha-2A receptor site?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the 'noise' by overstimulating the amygdala",
                "It strengthens the 'signal' by enhancing the connectivity of the Prefrontal Cortex",
                "It reduces the 'signal' to prevent sensory overload",
                "It has no effect on signal transduction in the PFC"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Norepinephrine increases the 'signal' by stimulating Alpha-2A receptors, which strengthens PFC network connectivity. Conversely, Dopamine (D1 receptors) decreases 'noise' by weakening irrelevant network connections."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to research on the Default Mode Network (DMN), why do individuals with ADHD often experience 'mind-wandering' during cognitively demanding tasks?",
            "options": [
                "The TPN (Task-Positive Network) is overactive",
                "The DMN and TPN become perfectly synchronized",
                "The DMN fails to suppress (deactivate) when the TPN is engaged",
                "The DMN is entirely absent in the ADHD brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In neurotypical brains, the DMN and TPN are anti-correlated (when one is on, the other is off). In ADHD, the DMN fails to sufficiently deactivate, leading to 'interference' where internal thoughts intrude upon external task performance."

                "Long-term Memory Retrieval"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Russell Barkley's model posits that Behavioral Inhibition is the primary deficit. Without the ability to 'stop' or delay a response, the four dependent executive functions (working memory, self-regulation, etc.) cannot function effectively."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD is among the most heritable psychiatric conditions, with twin and molecular genetic studies consistently placing heritability between 74% and 80%."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "When differentiating between ADHD and Bipolar Disorder, which clinical feature is most characteristic of ADHD-related emotional dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "Mood shifts that last for weeks or months",
                "A distinct period of decreased need for sleep (3+ days)",
                "Rapidly shifting moods triggered by external events/slights",
                "Grandiosity and inflated self-esteem lasting several days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ADHD emotional dysregulation is usually 'reactive' to triggers and lasts minutes to hours. Bipolar mood shifts are typically 'endogenous' (internal) and last for days or weeks, regardless of external circumstances."

            "id": "q4_7",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD involves an intense emotional response to perceived rejection. This is linked to the Prefrontal Cortex failing to regulate the 'bottom-up' emotional signaling from the Amygdala."

            "id": "q4_8",

                "The Serotonergic Raphe Nuclei"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Mesolimbic pathway (connecting the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens) is the brain's reward center. Dysfunction here leads to 'delay aversion' and the need for higher stimulation to feel a sense of reward."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client presents with significant difficulty in 'internalized self-directed speech,' often talking out loud to solve problems and lacking an 'inner critic' to guide behavior. According to Barkley, this represents a deficit in:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Verbal Working Memory is the process of internalizing speech to provide self-instruction and reflection. In ADHD, this process is often delayed or remains externalized longer than in neurotypical development."
