            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "According to the neurobiological understanding of ADHD, which specific pathway is primarily implicated in the 'reward deficiency syndrome' associated with impulsive behaviors?",
            "options": [
                "The Mesocortical pathway",
                "The Mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway",
                "The Nigrostriatal pathway",
                "The Tuberoinfundibular pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mesolimbic pathway, connecting the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens, is the primary reward circuit. In ADHD, dysfunction here leads to 'reward deficiency,' requiring higher stimulation to achieve the same level of satisfaction, which drives impulsivity."

                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extensive twin and molecular genetic studies consistently place the heritability of ADHD between 70% and 80%, making it one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions."

            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "When working with a client experiencing Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), which neuro-anatomical structure is typically overactive during the perception of social evaluation?",
            "options": [
                "The Hippocampus",
                "The Amygdala",
                "The Basal Ganglia",
                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RSD involves an intense emotional response where the Amygdala (the brain's emotional processing center) becomes hyper-reactive to perceived criticism or rejection, bypassing the prefrontal cortex's regulatory control."

            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "In the context of Executive Functioning (EF) support, 'Body Doubling' is an evidence-based intervention. What is the primary mechanism that makes this effective for ADHD clients?",
            "options": [
                "Social pressure to perform",
                "Increased dopamine through social interaction",

                "Direct improvement of working memory capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Body doubling works by providing an external 'anchor.' The presence of another person helps regulate the client's nervous system, reduces the 'activation energy' required to start a task, and provides a gentle social accountability that sustains focus."

        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "According to the DSM-5-TR, for an adult (17+) to be diagnosed with ADHD, how many symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be present?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While children require 6 symptoms, the DSM-5-TR reduced the threshold for adults (17 and older) to 5 symptoms in either category (inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity) because symptoms often manifest differently in adulthood."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dr. Russell Barkley's research highlights that individuals with ADHD often experience a developmental lag of approximately 30% in executive function skills (e.g., a 20-year-old may have the self-regulation of a 14-year-old)."

                "There is no clinical distinction between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ADHD mind-wandering is characterized by a spontaneous shift in attention toward unrelated (often neutral or stimulating) topics. GAD worry is characterized by persistent, uncontrollable, and distressing thoughts specifically about future threats."
