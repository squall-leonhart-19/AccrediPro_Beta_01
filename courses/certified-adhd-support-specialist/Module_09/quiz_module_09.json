            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Body doubling is a productivity strategy where the presence of another person provides a sense of accountability and reduces the 'activation energy' required to start and finish tasks."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Parent-Child Dynamic occurs when one partner takes on the majority of executive responsibilities, leading to resentment for the non-ADHD partner and a sense of shame or micromanagement for the ADHD partner."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike the persistent low mood of MDD, RSD is characterized by intense, short-lived emotional pain triggered by real or perceived rejection or criticism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen modulates dopamine. When estrogen levels drop (luteal phase or menopause), dopamine levels also drop, which can significantly exacerbate ADHD symptoms and reduce medication effectiveness."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
