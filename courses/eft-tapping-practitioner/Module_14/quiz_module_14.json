            "options": [
                "Attempt to lower the SUDS score immediately using the 'Movie Technique'",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional or emergency services immediately",
                "Continue the session but focus only on physical somatic sensations",
                "Ask the client to sign an additional waiver before proceeding with EFT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must recognize the boundaries of their scope; active suicidal ideation requires immediate referral to qualified clinical professionals or emergency services."

            "question": "Psychological Reversal (PR) is traditionally corrected in EFT by tapping on the Karate Chop point while stating a neutral or positive affirmation. What is the underlying 'Polarity' theory behind PR?",
            "options": [
                "The client is consciously lying about their desire to change",
                "The body's bio-electrical system is 'polarized' against the desired goal",
                "The practitioner has failed to build sufficient rapport",
                "The SUDS score is too low to register a change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological Reversal is conceptualized as a subconscious 'polarity' or energetic block where the individual's system is working against their stated conscious goal."

            "options": [
                "It helps the practitioner finish the session faster",
                "It ensures the practitioner's voice is always louder than the client's",
                "It synchronizes the practitioner's nervous system with the client's, facilitating co-regulation",
                "It prevents the client from falling asleep during the tapping rounds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vocal pacing and mirroring allow for co-regulation of the nervous system, creating a 'neurobiological bridge' of safety that facilitates deeper emotional processing."

                "The client's SUDS score increases from a 5 to an 8",
                "The client spontaneously reframes the problem with a phrase like, 'I guess they were just doing the best they could'",
                "The client asks to stop the session because they are bored"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A cognitive shift is an 'Aha!' moment where the client's perspective on the event changes naturally without the practitioner forcing a reframe."

            "question": "If a client's SUDS score is 'stuck' at a 7 after several rounds of tapping, what is the most effective troubleshooting step according to Module 14?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SUDS scores often appear 'stuck' because the practitioner is still tapping on the original aspect while the client's focus has shifted to a new emotional or physical aspect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somatic Bridge begins by 'intensifying' the awareness of the physical sensation (location, size, texture) to find the emotional 'hook' attached to it."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when a change is so profound and rapid that the client's mind cannot logically bridge the gap, leading them to dismiss EFT as the cause."

            "options": [
                "To see if the practitioner can trigger the original emotional response to ensure the work is complete",
                "To give the client a written exam on EFT history",
                "To justify charging the client for the full hour",
                "To determine if the client needs a referral to a psychiatrist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Testing (e.g., vivid visualization or provocative questioning) is essential to ensure the emotional charge is truly neutralized and not just temporarily suppressed."

            "options": [
                "The client wants to feel better to get a promotion",
                "The client's chronic pain provides them with significant attention and care from a spouse that they otherwise lack",
                "The client is afraid of the tapping points",
                "The client enjoys the taste of the water provided during the session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain occurs when the 'problem' provides a hidden benefit (e.g., attention, avoidance of responsibility), making the subconscious mind resistant to releasing the symptom."
