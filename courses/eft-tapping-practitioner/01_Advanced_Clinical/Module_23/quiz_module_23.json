            "question": "In Advanced Reframing, what is the primary distinction between a 'Context Reframe' and a 'Meaning Reframe'?",
            "options": [
                "Context reframing changes the emotional response, while meaning reframing changes the physical sensation.",
                "Context reframing shifts the situation where a behavior is appropriate, while meaning reframing changes the interpretation of the behavior itself.",
                "Context reframing is used for trauma, while meaning reframing is used only for positive EFT.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are used interchangeably in clinical practice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Context reframing explores where a specific behavior might be useful (e.g., 'stubbornness' as 'persistence' in business), whereas meaning reframing changes what the behavior signifies to the client."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "During Inner Child Integration, what is the clinical purpose of the 'Safe Space' or 'Bridge' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from the emotional intensity of the memory.",
                "To provide a neurological anchor that allows the adult self to support the younger self without re-traumatization.",
                "To prove to the client that the memory is factually incorrect.",
                "To allow the practitioner to take control of the client's narrative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Bridge' creates a safe neurological pathway for the adult consciousness to interact with the younger 'part,' facilitating integration and reparenting without flooding the nervous system."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In 'Parts Work' (Internal Conflict Resolution), what is the foundational assumption regarding a 'Resistant Part' that prevents a client from healing?",
            "options": [
                "The part is a manifestation of biological pathology that cannot be tapped away.",
                "The part is a 'saboteur' that must be eliminated or suppressed.",
                "The part has a 'Positive Intention' and is trying to protect the client from a perceived threat.",
                "The part is a sign that the client is not ready for advanced EFT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced EFT practitioners assume every 'part' has a positive intention (Secondary Gain). Resolving conflict requires acknowledging the part's protective role before negotiating a new behavior."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Which linguistic strategy involves using the client's exact sensory-based predicates to bypass the 'Critical Analytical Mind'?",

                "Metaphorical Substitution",
                "Clean Language and Echoing",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clean Language and Echoing use the client's specific vocabulary, which prevents the practitioner's biases from interfering and keeps the client in their internal sensory experience."

            "options": [
                "Pain symptoms increased initially before dropping by 10%.",
                "A 43% significant decrease in physical pain symptoms and a 37% decrease in cortisol levels.",
                "No significant change in physical pain, but a 50% improvement in mood.",
                "EFT was only effective for acute pain, not chronic psychosomatic conditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Bach et al. (2019) study demonstrated a 43% decrease in physical pain and a 37% decrease in cortisol, highlighting EFT's impact on the endocrine system and somatic pain."

            "question": "When performing Surrogate Tapping for a client who is not present, what is the 'Ethical Gold Standard' required for advanced practitioners?",
            "options": [
                "Surrogate tapping can be done on anyone at any time without permission.",
                "You must only tap for children under the age of 5.",
                "Obtaining explicit permission from the individual or tapping for 'the highest good of all concerned' if permission is impossible.",
                "Surrogate tapping is only ethical if the practitioner is related to the subject."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethics in surrogate work require either explicit permission or a clear intention that the work is for the 'highest good,' ensuring the practitioner does not attempt to manipulate another's will."

            "options": [
                "It only measures physical pain.",
                "It ranges from -10 to +10, focusing on increasing positive energy flow rather than just reducing distress.",
                "It is used only for professional athletes.",
                "It requires a blood pressure monitor to validate the score."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SUE Scale allows for the measurement of 'positive' states (+1 to +10), which is essential for peak performance and moving beyond 'zero' (the absence of distress)."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "In the 'Cinema Technique,' if a client reaches a 'crescendo' or 'peak' in the movie and becomes overwhelmed, what is the correct advanced intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client to push through the memory to finish the movie.",
                "Change the movie to a comedy immediately.",
                "Stop the movie, 'Freeze Frame' the image, and tap on the 'now' intensity before continuing.",
                "End the session immediately as the client is dissociating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Freeze Frame' allows the practitioner to isolate the specific 'Sticking Point' and reduce the intensity of that specific micro-moment before proceeding with the rest of the narrative."

            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' who suffered from chronic migraines, her symptoms only improved after tapping on the 'Part' of her that felt safe staying home from a toxic job. This is an example of:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain occurs when a symptom provides a hidden benefit (e.g., protection from a toxic environment). Addressing the 'benefit' of the pain is often the key to resolving chronic conditions."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Narrative Refinement' in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "To make the client's story sound more dramatic.",
                "To help the client rewrite their history so they forget the trauma occurred.",
                "To transition the client from a 'Victim Narrative' to a 'Hero/Survivor Narrative' by shifting the emotional charge of the story's conclusion.",
                "To ensure the client can recite their story without crying."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative Refinement focuses on the 'meaning' the client assigns to their story, evolving it from a story of 'what happened to me' to a story of 'how I evolved/survived.'"
