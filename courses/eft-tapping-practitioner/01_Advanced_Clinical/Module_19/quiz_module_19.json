            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that EFT often achieves similar clinical outcomes to CBT but typically requires fewer sessions to reach those results."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "The 'Physics of Tapping' involves mechanotransduction. Which of the following best describes this process in the context of EFT?",
            "options": [
                "The conversion of emotional thoughts into muscle tension",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mechanotransduction is the process by which cells convert mechanical stimulus (tapping) into electrochemical activity, affecting the body's piezoelectric system."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "To trigger 'Memory Reconsolidation,' a practitioner must create an 'emotional mismatch.' How is this achieved in an EFT session?",
            "options": [
                "By asking the client to ignore the pain while tapping",
                "By having the client recall a traumatic memory while simultaneously sending a calming signal to the amygdala via tapping",
                "By ensuring the client is in a state of high distress for the entire session",
                "By using logical arguments to prove the client's memory is inaccurate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Memory reconsolidation requires the 'mismatch' of activating a stressful memory while providing a contradictory somatic signal of safety (tapping), which unlocks the synapse to update the memory."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "According to the research on EFT and the HPA axis, what happens to the 'fight or flight' response during tapping?",
            "options": [
                "It is temporarily increased to 'burn out' the stress",
                "It is bypassed entirely by the circulatory system",
                "The amygdala's alarm response is downregulated, signaling the hippocampus that the threat is no longer present",
                "It is converted into a digestive response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tapping sends a deactivating signal to the amygdala, which downregulates the HPA axis and stops the production of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline."
