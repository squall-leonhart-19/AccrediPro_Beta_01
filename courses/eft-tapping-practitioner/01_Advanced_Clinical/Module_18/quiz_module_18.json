                "To introduce a new traumatic memory for the next session",

            "options": [
                "At the very beginning of the session before tapping starts",
                "When the SUDs level is still at an 8 or 9 to provide maximum contrast",
                "Only after the intensity has dropped to a 3 or lower and a 'cognitive shift' is observed",
