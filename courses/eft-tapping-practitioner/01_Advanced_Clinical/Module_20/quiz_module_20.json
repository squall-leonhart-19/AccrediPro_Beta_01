            "question": "In the context of Advanced Scaling (Lesson 1), how does the Validity of Cognition (VOC) scale differ from the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) scale?",
            "options": [
                "VOC measures the intensity of negative emotions on a 0-10 scale.",
                "VOC measures the perceived truth of a positive statement on a 1-7 scale.",
                "VOC is used only for physical pain, while SUDS is used for emotional pain.",
                "VOC measures the frequency of a behavior over a 30-day period."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While SUDS measures the intensity of distress (0-10), the VOC scale measures how true a positive cognition feels to the client, typically on a scale of 1 (completely false) to 7 (completely true)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I' in the T.A.P.P.I.N.G. Protocol™ stands for Identifying Initial Imprints, which refers to the earliest childhood memories or 'root' events that formed the client's current belief system."

            "question": "A client says, 'I am ready to earn more money,' but then immediately thinks, 'But my family will think I'm greedy.' In Lesson 3, this internal 'but' is defined as:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Tail-Ender is the 'yeah, but' or the self-sabotaging thought that follows a positive affirmation, revealing the underlying limiting belief that needs tapping."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "When utilizing Somatic Mapping (Lesson 4), why is it critical to ask the client for the specific 'texture' or 'shape' of a physical sensation?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from the emotional pain.",
                "To provide a precise neurological 'hook' for the amygdala to process the sensation.",
                "To determine if the client requires a medical referral for physical illness.",
                "To lengthen the session and ensure the client feels heard."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specific somatic descriptions (e.g., 'a jagged red heat') provide a concrete target for the brain, making the tapping more effective at desensitizing the physiological stress response."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "The Core Issues Questionnaire (CIQ) helps practitioners move from 'Global' issues to 'Specific' events. Which of the following is an example of a 'Specific Event'?",

                "I feel like I am never good enough for my partner."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific events have a clear timeframe, location, and sensory details. Options A, B, and D are global generalizations or 'table tops' that require further narrowing."
        },

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A client’s SUDS remains at an 8 after four rounds of tapping. According to Lesson 6, the practitioner should immediately assess for:",

                "Psychological Reversal or Secondary Gain.",

                "Whether the client is using the correct hand for tapping."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When progress plateaus (a 'stuck' SUDS), it often indicates Psychological Reversal (the subconscious mind resisting change) or Secondary Gain (an unconscious benefit to keeping the problem)."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quantitative progress in EFT is best measured by tracking how intense the symptoms are (Intensity), how often they occur (Frequency), and how long they last when they do occur (Duration)."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module found that integrating the 'Somatic Mapping' technique with EFT led to what percentage increase in 'session-to-session symptom resolution' compared to standard EFT?",

                "12%",
                "27%",
                "44%",
                "61%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module cites research indicating a 27% increase in resolution speed when specific somatic mapping is integrated into the assessment phase."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "During an intake using the CIQ, a client identifies a 'Core Belief' that 'The world is dangerous.' What is the most effective next step for the practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "Have the client tap on the phrase 'The world is dangerous' until the SUDS is 0.",
                "Ask the client to find 3-5 specific memories that 'prove' this belief is true.",
                "Tell the client that this belief is irrational and provide logical counter-arguments.",
                "Assign the client a VOC scale assessment for 'The world is safe' and end the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EFT is most effective when targeting specific 'legs' (memories) that support the 'table top' (the global belief). Tapping on the global belief alone is rarely permanent."
