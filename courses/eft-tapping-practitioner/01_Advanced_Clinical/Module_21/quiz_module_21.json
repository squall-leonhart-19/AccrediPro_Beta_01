            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a DSM-5 clinical disorder",
                "To identify the interconnectedness between current symptoms, past events, and core beliefs",
                "To immediately begin tapping on the highest intensity trauma mentioned",
                "To provide the client with a list of affirmations to use at home"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Issue mapping allows the practitioner to see the 'big picture' by connecting surface-level symptoms (branches) to their underlying origins (roots) and the limiting beliefs that sustain them."

                "The Roots (Specific Past Events)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Roots represent the specific foundational memories and events that give rise to the trunk (beliefs) and the branches (current life problems)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While simple phobias may resolve in 1-3 sessions, meta-analyses (such as Nelms & Castel, 2021) suggest that complex trauma typically requires 10 or more sessions for sustained clinical recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is a safety technique used to keep the client within their 'Window of Tolerance' by processing only small pieces of a memory at a time."

            "options": [
                "It helps identify hidden sensory details or shifts in the memory that maintain the emotional charge",

                "It is the stage where the practitioner performs physical acupuncture",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Probing for aspects ensures that all facets of a memory (sights, sounds, smells, thoughts) are cleared, preventing the issue from returning later."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A cognitive shift is a hallmark of successful EFT, where the client's internal narrative about the event changes naturally as the emotional charge is removed."

                "It prevents the client from becoming flooded or re-traumatized by approaching the intensity gradually",
                "It is only used when the practitioner doesn't know what the problem is",
                "It requires the client to be in a deep hypnotic trance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sneaking Up on the trauma allows the practitioner to test the 'waters' of the memory without overwhelming the client's nervous system, which is essential for C-PTSD safety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Termination planning focuses on client autonomy, ensuring they can use EFT independently to manage new stressors as they arise."

                "Dive immediately into the most painful bullying memory to 'clear it out'",
                "Use 'Tapping on the Breath' or 'The Tearless Trauma Technique' to lower her baseline arousal",
                "Tell her to come back when she is feeling less emotional",
                "Focus on her future goals and ignore the past bullying for now"

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is overwhelmed (high baseline arousal), the practitioner must first use gentle techniques like 'Tapping on the Breath' to establish safety before addressing the 'roots'."
