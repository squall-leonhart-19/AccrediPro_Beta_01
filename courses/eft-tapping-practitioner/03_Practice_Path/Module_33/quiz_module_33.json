            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners must recognize the boundaries of their scope; clinical depression and suicidal ideation require referral to licensed medical or mental health professionals to avoid practicing medicine/psychology without a license."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To mitigate risk, the disclosure must explicitly state that EFT is considered experimental/alternative and is not a substitute for licensed medical or psychological advice."

                "The FTC does not regulate health claims, only financial claims."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires that health-related claims, especially those using words like 'cure' or 'treat,' be backed by high-level scientific evidence. Using such terms without clinical licensure and rigorous data risks heavy fines."
