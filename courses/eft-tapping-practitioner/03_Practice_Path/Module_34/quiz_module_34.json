            "question": "According to research by Dr. Dawson Church (2013) on 'Borrowing Benefits,' what was the average reduction in cortisol levels for group participants who tapped along with a demonstration, even if they weren't the focus of the session?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "24%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies on 'Borrowing Benefits' have shown that group participants experience an average cortisol reduction of 24%, demonstrating that the physiological benefits of EFT occur even when tapping vicariously."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a professional EFT workshop curriculum, what is the recommended ratio of experiential 'tapping time' to didactic 'instructional time' to maximize adult learning?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional EFT workshops are most effective when they follow a 70/30 split, prioritizing hands-on practice and 'Borrowing Benefits' sessions over theoretical lectures."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "During a group session, a participant experiences a sudden, intense emotional abreaction. What is the practitioner's primary responsibility according to the 'Safety First' protocol?",

                "Stop the group and have the participant leave the room to calm down.",
                "Continue the group session while ignoring the participant to avoid giving it 'energy'.",
                "Keep the participant tapping (or tap for them) while ensuring the rest of the group continues tapping for their own 'Borrowing Benefits'.",
                "Immediately switch the group to a different topic to distract everyone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The practitioner must maintain the safety of the individual by keeping them tapping through the abreaction, while simultaneously using the group's collective energy to support the process through 'Borrowing Benefits'."

                "A physical barrier between the stage and the audience.",
                "A psychological framework where the facilitator sets clear boundaries and 'global' rather than 'specific' targets for the crowd.",
                "A legal waiver signed by all participants before the event.",
                "A specific tapping point on the wrist used only for groups."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Safe Container' in large demonstrations involves using more general language and 'Global Tapping' to ensure that hundreds of people don't dive into deep trauma simultaneously without individual support."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to internet lag, unmuted group tapping sounds discordant and can be dysregulating. The best practice is for participants to remain muted while repeating the practitioner's words."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Funnel Method starts with broad, relatable topics (e.g., 'Work Stress') in the first week and gradually guides the group toward deeper, more specific core beliefs as safety and rapport increase."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Beta Launch is a 'test run' offered at a lower price point to refine the content based on real-world results and collect the testimonials necessary for a full-price public launch."
