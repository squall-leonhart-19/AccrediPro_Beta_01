                "A marketing plan detailing client acquisition strategies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Informed Consent and Liability Waiver clearly defines that EFT is not a substitute for medical or psychiatric advice, establishing a legal boundary for your scope of practice."

                "Generalists have to pay higher insurance premiums",
                "Specialists can charge a 'premium' because they solve a specific, high-urgency problem",
                "It is legally required to have a niche in most jurisdictions",
                "Generalists are unable to use social media effectively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization allows a practitioner to become an expert in a specific pain point, which increases perceived value and allows for transformation-based pricing rather than commodity-based hourly rates."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing commoditizes your time. As you become more proficient and achieve results faster, your total revenue decreases if you are paid by the hour rather than for the outcome."
