            "question": "What is the primary psychological mechanism behind the 'Even though...' structure in the EFT Setup Statement?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from the physical sensation of tapping",
                "To create a cognitive bridge between the acknowledgment of a problem and self-acceptance",
                "To induce a hypnotic state through repetitive linguistic patterns",
                "To force the client to ignore the negative emotion entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Even though' structure utilizes the 'Acceptance Paradox,' allowing the client to acknowledge the distress while simultaneously affirming self-worth, which reduces cognitive dissonance and lowers limbic system arousal."

            "question": "When utilizing the 'Sore Spot' instead of the Karate Chop point during the Setup, where is the practitioner or client specifically locating this area?",
            "options": [
                "On the outer edge of the hand between the wrist and the pinky finger",
                "Directly on the center of the sternum (CV17)",
                "Approximately 3 inches down and 2 inches over from the base of the throat in the infraclavicular region",
                "At the junction where the thumb and index finger meet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Sore Spot is a neurolymphatic congestion point located in the upper chest, roughly 3 inches down and 2 inches over from the u-shaped notch at the base of the throat."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the case of 'Sarah,' a client who experienced a 43% reduction in cortisol but struggled with the phrase 'I deeply and completely love and accept myself,' which 'Troubleshooting' variation is most appropriate according to Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Insisting she say the original phrase until she believes it",
                "Skipping the acceptance phrase and only tapping on the problem",
                "Using a 'Progressive Acceptance' phrase like 'I am open to the possibility of accepting myself'",
                "Stopping the session until she can find the root cause of her self-loathing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 teaches that for clients with high trauma or low self-worth, 'Progressive Acceptance' phrases (e.g., 'I am open to the possibility...') prevent the 'Tail-Ender' effect where the mind rejects an overly positive statement."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "According to the research cited in Lesson 1 (e.g., Church et al., 2012), the Setup Statement helps neutralize the 'Threat Response.' What specific physiological change was noted in the 2020 meta-analysis regarding EFT and the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "An average 37% increase in serotonin levels",
                "A significant reduction in salivary cortisol levels compared to talk therapy",
                "A 15% increase in alpha brain wave activity",
                "A complete cessation of amygdala firing for 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses and RCTs (like Church et al.) consistently show that EFT, starting with the Setup, significantly reduces salivary cortisol, indicating a deactivation of the Body's stress response (HPA axis)."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What does the term 'Psychological Reversal' (PR) specifically refer to in the context of the 'P' Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "When a client accidentally taps the points in the wrong order",
                "A subconscious 'polarity' or resistance where the client's internal system perceives it is 'safer' to keep the problem",
                "The moment a client's SUD score goes from a 2 to a 10",
                "A rare neurological condition where the brain flips images"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological Reversal is a form of subconscious resistance or secondary gain where the client's system is 'reversed' regarding the goal of healing, often requiring the Setup Statement to neutralize it."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "When formulating a Problem Statement for a client with 'Chronic Back Pain,' which approach follows the 'Precision Rule' discussed in Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "'Even though I have this back pain...'",
                "'Even though I feel bad today...'",
                "'Even though I have this sharp, stabbing pain in my lower right lumbar when I bend forward...'",
                "'Even though my body is failing me...'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Precision is key in EFT. The more specific the description (sharp, stabbing, lower right lumbar, when bending), the more effectively the tapping can target the specific neural pathway associated with that distress."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which meridian point is being stimulated when tapping the Karate Chop (KC) point during the Setup?",

                "Gallbladder 20 (GB20)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Karate Chop point is located on the Small Intestine 3 (SI3) meridian point, which is traditionally used in acupuncture to treat 'neck and shoulder tension' and 'clearing the mind.'"

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "If a client presents with a 'Secondary Gain' (e.g., 'If I get healthy, I will have to go back to a job I hate'), how should the Setup Statement be adapted?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the gain and focus only on the physical symptoms",
                "Address the gain directly: 'Even though I'm afraid of going back to work if I get better...'",
                "Tell the client they are sabotaging the session",
                "Increase the pressure of the tapping on the Karate Chop point"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gains are a form of Psychological Reversal. Addressing the fear of the consequence of healing directly in the Setup Statement helps clear the subconscious resistance to getting well."

                "Professional athletes only",
                "Clients with severe dissociation or children who find the 'I' statements too intense",

                "Only when working with groups of 50 or more"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Third Person Setup (e.g., 'Even though [Name] has this problem...') provides a 'distancing' effect that is helpful for children or clients who are too overwhelmed by direct 'I' statements."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended frequency for repeating the Setup Statement during a single round of the 'P' Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Once, very quickly before tapping the other points",
                "Three times while continuously stimulating the Karate Chop or Sore Spot",
                "Ten times to ensure the subconscious hears it",
                "Every time you move to a new tapping point on the face"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard EFT protocol involves repeating the Setup Statement three times to ensure the system is sufficiently 'primed' and any Psychological Reversal is addressed before moving to the sequence."
