            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Language for the Setup Statement, what is the primary clinical purpose of the 'Acceptance' phrase (e.g., 'I deeply and completely accept myself')?",
            "options": [
                "To force the client to like themselves despite their flaws",
                "To neutralize psychological reversal by creating a state of safety and self-compassion",
                "To serve as a positive affirmation that overrides the negative problem",
                "To distract the conscious mind while the tapping works on the subconscious"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The acceptance phrase is designed to neutralize 'Psychological Reversal'—the subconscious resistance to letting go of a problem—by establishing a baseline of safety and reducing the threat response."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "When moving from 'Global' to 'Granular' issues in Lesson 2, which of the following statements represents the highest level of specificity?",
            "options": [
                "I have always felt like I wasn't good enough for my family.",
                "I felt really anxious during my presentation at work last week.",
                "The sharp sting in my chest when my manager sighed during the 3rd slide of my presentation.",
                "Work-related stress is making it hard for me to sleep at night."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Granularity in EFT involves isolating a specific sensory moment (the sigh), a specific time (3rd slide), and a specific somatic sensation (sharp sting in the chest)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "During Somatic Tracking, a client reports that the 'heavy pressure' in their chest has disappeared, but they now feel a 'throbbing' in their temples. What does this transition indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The tapping is not working and should be stopped immediately.",
                "The client is experiencing a 'Tail-Ender' regarding their health.",
                "The tapping has successfully cleared one aspect, and a new aspect has surfaced.",
                "The client is experiencing the Apex Effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physical shifts (Somatic Tracking) often signal that the energy is moving or that a new 'aspect' of the issue is presenting itself, requiring the practitioner to shift the target of the tapping."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "How should a practitioner handle 'Complex Aspects' when a client's SUD score remains high despite several rounds of tapping?",
            "options": [
                "Break the issue down into smaller 'table legs' or sensory components.",
                "Increase the pressure used on the tapping points.",
                "Tell the client to focus harder on the negative emotion.",
                "Switch to a different global issue to build momentum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If the SUD score doesn't drop, it usually means the target is too 'Global.' Breaking it down into 'table legs' (specific events or sensory aspects) allows for more effective clearing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, what is a 'Tail-Ender' in the EFT process?",
            "options": [
                "The physical sensation felt at the very end of a tapping round.",
                "The subconscious 'Yes, but...' or limiting belief that follows a positive statement.",
                "A client who arrives late to their tapping sessions consistently.",
                "The final tapping point located on the top of the head."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tail-Enders are the internal objections or 'inner critics' that arise when a person says something positive or sets a goal, representing the true target for the next round of tapping."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When tapping for immediate cravings (Lesson 6), what is the most effective way to focus the client's attention?",
            "options": [
                "Focus on the long-term health consequences of the substance.",
                "Focus on the willpower needed to resist the urge.",
                "Focus on the specific sensory qualities of the craving (smell, texture, the 'promise' of the taste).",
                "Focus on the guilt the client feels after consuming the substance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EFT for cravings works best when the client engages with the immediate sensory triggers of the substance, rather than abstract concepts like health or guilt."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "A client successfully lowers their SUD from a 9 to a 2 but then claims, 'I think I just calmed down on my own; the tapping probably didn't do much.' This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Dissonance.",
                "Psychological Reversal.",
                "The Apex Effect.",
                "Future Pacing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when a shift is so profound or sudden that the client’s logical mind cannot bridge the gap between the previous intensity and the current relief, leading them to dismiss the intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'Future Pacing' at the end of an EFT session?",
            "options": [
                "To manifest a positive outcome using the Law of Attraction.",
                "To test the results by having the client vividly imagine a future scenario that would have previously triggered them.",
                "To ensure the client schedules their next appointment.",
                "To give the client a list of affirmations to say at home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future Pacing acts as a 'stress test' for the work done. If the client imagines a future trigger and feels no distress, the work is likely integrated; if they feel distress, more aspects need to be cleared."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A 2019 study (Bach et al.) mentioned in the module found that a one-hour EFT session reduced cortisol levels by an average of:",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "24%",
                "43%",
                "68%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study by Bach et al. (2019) demonstrated that EFT resulted in a 43% decrease in cortisol, significantly higher than the 19% reduction found in the talk therapy control group."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes a 'Cognitive Shift' following a successful EFT intervention?",
            "options": [
                "The client forgets why they came to the session.",
                "The client experiences a headache due to energy movement.",
                "The client spontaneously views the problem from a new, more empowered, or detached perspective.",
                "The client decides to stop tapping because they feel 'cured' after one round."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Cognitive Shift is a hallmark of successful EFT, where the client's 'reframe' of the situation happens naturally (e.g., 'He was just doing the best he could' instead of 'He was trying to hurt me')."
