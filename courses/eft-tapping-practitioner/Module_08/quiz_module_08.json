            "question": "In the context of 'Mastering Specificity,' why is the 'Table Leg Metaphor' used to describe the relationship between global issues and specific events?",
            "options": [
                "The table top represents the specific event, while the legs represent the emotions.",
                "The table top represents the global issue (e.g., 'I'm a failure'), and the legs represent the specific memories that support that belief.",
                "The legs represent the practitioner's skills, and the table top represents the client's progress.",
                "The table top represents the SUDs score, and the legs represent the tapping points."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In EFT, a global issue or belief (the table top) is supported by specific traumatic or negative memories (the legs). By collapsing the 'legs' through specific tapping, the global belief eventually collapses."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes 'Psychological Reversal' (PR) as discussed in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "A client's physical inability to feel the tapping points.",
                "A conscious desire to remain in a state of suffering to gain attention.",
                "An unconscious 'polarity' or self-sabotage mechanism where the system resists change despite a conscious desire to heal.",
                "A neurological condition where the brain processes tapping signals in reverse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Psychological Reversal is an unconscious interference—often rooted in secondary gain or safety concerns—that prevents the tapping from being effective until addressed via the Setup Statement."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "During the 'Investigate' phase, a practitioner notices a client's 'Somatic Marker' (e.g., a sudden clenching of the jaw). According to Lesson 3, what is the most effective next step?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore it and continue with the current tapping script to maintain flow.",
                "Ask the client to stop tapping and perform a breathing exercise.",
                "Bring the client's attention to the sensation and use it as a 'bridge' to find the underlying specific event.",
                "Immediately refer the client to a massage therapist for the jaw tension."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic markers are physical manifestations of emotional data. Using the 'Affect Bridge' or 'Somatic Bridge' helps the practitioner move from a vague feeling to a specific, targetable memory."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client is tapping on a memory of a car accident. Initially, they feel 'terror' (SUDs 9). After two rounds, the terror is a 2, but they now feel 'guilt' (SUDs 8) for being the driver. This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "A failed intervention.",
                "Shifting Aspects.",

                "The Apex Effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shifting Aspects occurs when the emotional focus of a memory changes (e.g., from terror to guilt, or from a sound to a visual). Each aspect must be treated as a separate 'target' for tapping."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "When applying the 'Movie Technique' (Lesson 5), what is the 'Safe Distance' protocol if a client's SUDs level rises sharply before they even begin the mental movie?",
            "options": [

                "Tell the client to 'push through' the fear to reach the end of the movie.",
                "Change the subject to a positive memory to regulate their nervous system.",
                "Increase the speed of the movie so it ends faster."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If a client is distressed just thinking about the movie, the 'anticipation' of the movie is the current aspect that must be tapped down to a manageable level (usually SUDs 2 or 3) before proceeding."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Bach et al. (2019) study demonstrated a 37% reduction in cortisol levels following an hour of EFT, significantly higher than the 14% reduction found in the control group (talk therapy/rest)."

            "options": [
                "A Cognitive Shift is always accompanied by a physical release (sigh, relaxation) and a spontaneous change in perspective.",
                "Logical Rationalization is always louder than a Cognitive Shift.",
                "There is no difference; both indicate the session was successful.",
                "A Cognitive Shift only happens at the beginning of a session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A genuine Cognitive Shift is a 'reframe' that comes from the client's own system once the emotional charge is gone, often accompanied by somatic markers of relief, unlike logical rationalization which is an intellectual 'should'."

            "question": "In the Case Study of 'Michael' (Lesson 8), he struggled with public speaking. After tapping on a memory of being laughed at in 4th grade, his SUDs dropped, but he felt 'heavy' in his chest. What does this 'heaviness' represent in the Clinical EFT process?",
            "options": [
                "A sign that the tapping is not working.",
                "A new somatic aspect that requires its own focused tapping rounds.",

                "The end of the session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "New physical sensations arising after an emotional release are typically new 'aspects' of the memory or related memories that need to be addressed specifically."

            "question": "According to the Practitioner Ethics and Scope of Practice (Lesson 7), what is the 'Red Flag' protocol for a client expressing active suicidal ideation?",

                "Tap more vigorously on the 'Sore Spot' to ground them.",

                "Ask the client to sign a waiver and continue the EFT session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation is outside the scope of practice for non-licensed EFT practitioners and requires immediate referral to qualified mental health professionals or emergency services."

                "To ensure the client is fully present in their body and the current environment before leaving.",
                "To convince the client to book another ten sessions.",
                "To perform a final SUDs check on every problem the client has ever had.",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Grounding Phase ensures the client has transitioned from the 'theta-like' state of deep emotional work back to a functional, alert state (Beta/Alpha) for their safety and integration."
