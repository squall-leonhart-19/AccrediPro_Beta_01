            "options": [
                "It allows the client to process the entire trauma in a single session for maximum efficiency.",
                "It prevents flooding and re-traumatization by breaking the trauma into 'micro-slices' of manageable intensity.",
                "It involves using a higher pressure during tapping to stimulate the amygdala more effectively.",
                "It is a legal requirement for practitioners working without a clinical license."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of slowing down the emotional release to ensure the client remains within their 'Window of Tolerance,' preventing the nervous system from becoming overwhelmed (flooding)."

                "The genetic markers associated with their specific diagnosis.",
                "The symbolic link between a physical symptom (e.g., restricted breathing) and a life experience (e.g., feeling 'suffocated' by a relationship).",
                "The specific day and time the illness will be fully resolved."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Body's Metaphor explores how the subconscious mind expresses emotional conflict through physical somatization, often using literal symbolic language in the form of symptoms."

            "options": [
                "They are the physical sensations felt at the end of a tapping round.",
                "They are the final 10 minutes of a session reserved for goal setting.",
                "They are the 'Yes, but...' internal objections that arise when a client states a positive affirmation or goal.",
                "They are the specific tapping points located on the lower extremities."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are the subconscious doubts or limiting beliefs that follow a positive statement. Tapping on these specific objections is the key to clearing blocks to peak performance."

                "It only worked if the client followed a strict ketogenic diet simultaneously.",
                "The reduction in food cravings and weight loss were maintained or improved at a 12-month follow-up.",
                "It was only effective for chocolate cravings but not for savory foods.",
                "The results were identical to those of a standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that EFT provides long-term maintenance of results in weight management, which is a significant differentiator from traditional dieting or standard behavioral interventions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Surrogate tapping or 'Imaginary Tapping' allows the benefits of EFT to be realized without triggering the sensory sensitivities common in neurodivergent children."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary losses are the ripple effects of a death. Addressing these (like the loss of a shared future or financial stability) is essential for comprehensive grief support."

            "explanation": "The Bach et al. (2019) study showed a 37% reduction in cortisol, significantly higher than the 14% reduction seen in the psychoeducation control group, proving EFT's impact on the endocrine system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Safety Conflict occurs when the subconscious mind prioritizes immediate survival (stress response) over reproduction, often due to unresolved trauma or extreme anxiety about pregnancy."

            "options": [
                "To ensure the client pays for the full hour of the session.",
                "Because the 'Empty Space' represents the emotional void the substance was filling, which must be addressed to prevent relapse.",
                "Because the client will feel physically nauseous if the space isn't filled.",
                "To increase the client's heart rate to normal levels."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addictions often serve a function—numbing pain or providing a sense of connection. If the behavior is removed without addressing the underlying emotional void, the client is at high risk for substitute addictions."
