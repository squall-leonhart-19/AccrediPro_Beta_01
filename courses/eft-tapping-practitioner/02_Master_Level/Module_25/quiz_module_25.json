            "question": "According to Proctor’s (1986) Functional Model of Supervision, which function focuses specifically on the practitioner's emotional well-being and the prevention of burnout?",
            "options": ["The Normative function", "The Formative function", "The Restorative function", "The Evaluative function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative (or supportive) function focuses on the practitioner's emotional reaction to their work, providing a space to process stress and prevent vicarious trauma."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "In the 7-Eyed Model of Supervision (Hawkins & Shohet), 'Eye 5' focuses on the relationship between the supervisor and the supervisee. What is the primary phenomenon often observed here?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Dissonance", "Parallel Process", "The Bystander Effect", "Somatic Mirroring"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parallel Process occurs when the dynamics between the client and practitioner are unconsciously replicated in the relationship between the practitioner and the supervisor."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A practitioner finds themselves feeling uncharacteristically angry when a client forgets to do their EFT 'homework.' Which concept from Lesson 3 best describes this reaction?",
            "options": ["Positive Transference", "Projective Identification", "Countertransference", "Secondary Traumatic Stress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference refers to the practitioner's unconscious emotional response to the client, often triggered by the practitioner's own unresolved issues or the client's behavior."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis of energy psychology practitioners (n=1,450) indicated that what percentage of practitioners experienced 'high' levels of vicarious trauma before implementing regular supervision?",
            "options": ["12%", "28%", "47%", "65%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that nearly half (47%) of practitioners working with trauma without regular supervision report high levels of secondary traumatic stress symptoms."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "When presenting an advanced case in supervision, the 'Case Formulation' section is critical. What is the primary goal of this section?",
            "options": ["To list every tapping point used in the session", "To provide a verbatim transcript of the dialogue", "To synthesize the client's history with EFT theory to explain the 'why' behind the symptoms", "To prove to the supervisor that the practitioner followed all protocols"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case formulation is the theoretical bridge that links the client's presenting problems to the underlying psychological mechanisms, guiding the treatment plan."

            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "In the context of professional ethics, how is a 'boundary violation' distinguished from a 'boundary crossing'?",
            "options": ["A violation is accidental; a crossing is intentional", "A violation is harmful or exploitative; a crossing is a minor deviation that may be clinically helpful", "A crossing is illegal; a violation is merely unprofessional", "There is no distinction; both are grounds for immediate license revocation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boundary crossings are minor deviations (like accepting a small gift) that may not harm the client, whereas violations are exploitative and harmful to the therapeutic relationship."

            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "During group supervision, the 'Ringelmann Effect' can occur. How is this best managed by the facilitator?",
            "options": ["By increasing the group size to 20+ members", "By ensuring individual accountability and specific contributions from each member", "By allowing the most vocal member to lead the entire session", "By avoiding structured agendas"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ringelmann Effect (social loafing) describes the tendency for individual productivity to decrease in a group. It is managed through individual accountability and structured participation."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "In the 'Mentorship' phase of professional development, Kram (1983) identifies the 'Separation' phase. What characterizes this stage?",
            "options": ["The mentor fires the protégé for incompetence", "The protégé begins to function independently and may experience feelings of anxiety or liberation", "The mentor and protégé become equal business partners immediately", "The relationship is terminated due to an ethical breach"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Separation phase occurs when the protégé moves toward independence, which involves a shift in the relationship dynamic and increased autonomy."

            "options": ["Increased Resting Heart Rate", "Decreased Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "Increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "Decreased Bone Density"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular restorative supervision helps regulate the nervous system, which is reflected in increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a marker of resilience and parasympathetic tone."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious traumatization involves a shift in the practitioner's world view and the experience of intrusive symptoms (like nightmares) resulting from empathetic engagement with a client's trauma."
