            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration is the critical phase where the practitioner ensures the somatic release is bridged with a new, functional cognitive reframe to consolidate neural pathways."

            "question": "During somatic calibration, a practitioner notices a 'micro-expression' of fear lasting 1/20th of a second when the client taps on 'I am safe.' This likely indicates:",
            "options": [

                "That the tapping pressure is too high on the eyebrow point"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micro-expressions are involuntary leaks of suppressed emotion. Seeing fear while stating a positive affirmation suggests a 'Tail-Ender' or subconscious objection that hasn't been cleared."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the subconscious benefits (financial, emotional, or social) that a client receives from maintaining a symptom, which creates deep-seated resistance to healing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unconscious countertransference occurs when a practitioner’s own emotional history is triggered by the client, leading them to direct the session based on their own needs rather than the client's."

                "Only work with clients who have the same trauma history as them"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery involves the transition from rigid adherence to 'flow,' where the practitioner uses the protocol as a foundation while allowing their unique clinical intuition to guide the session."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elena's resistance was rooted in secondary gain; her subconscious believed that staying 'invisible' protected her relationship with her mother, who was competitive and envious."
