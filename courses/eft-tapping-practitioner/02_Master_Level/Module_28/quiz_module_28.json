            "question": "In the context of EFT practice, what is the primary factor that distinguishes a 'crisis' from 'high-intensity emotional distress'?",
            "options": [
                "The client is crying uncontrollably and cannot speak.",
                "The temporary collapse of the client's internal and external coping mechanisms, rendering them unable to function.",
                "The client reports a Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) level of 10/10.",
                "The session lasts longer than the scheduled 60 minutes due to emotional release."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While high SUD levels are common in EFT, a crisis is specifically defined by the failure of a client's usual coping strategies, leading to a state of disequilibrium and an inability to maintain safety or daily function."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "If a client experiences a sudden, overwhelming abreaction (emotional flooding) during a session, which 'Stop-and-Ground' technique is recommended as the first line of intervention?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Floor of the Room' technique to orient the client to physical reality.",
                "Continuing to tap on the Gamut point while asking the client to describe the trauma in detail.",
                "The 'Movie Technique' to create distance from the emotion.",
                "Asking the client to close their eyes and go deeper into the feeling to 'clear' it."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Floor of the Room' technique is a grounding tool that shifts the client's focus from internal trauma to external physical sensations (the feeling of the floor, the chair, etc.), helping to stabilize the nervous system."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Tolerance' model (Ogden et al.), a client who becomes 'numb,' 'spaced out,' or 'non-responsive' is likely in which state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is characterized by a 'shutdown' response, including numbness, dissociation, and a lack of physical or emotional sensation, which requires grounding rather than further emotional processing."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 2020 study by Bach et al. showed a significant 43% reduction in cortisol levels following EFT, nearly double the reduction found in previous 2012 studies (24%)."

                "The client's ability to tap on themselves at home."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secondary gain refers to the hidden advantages of an illness that may cause the subconscious mind to 'hold onto' symptoms as a form of protection or adaptation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety plans must be collaborative and include internal coping skills (what the client can do alone), social supports, and professional resources (crisis lines/ER)."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "How does 'Vicarious Trauma' (VT) specifically differ from 'Burnout'?",
            "options": [
                "Burnout is only found in medical doctors, while VT is found in EFT practitioners.",
                "VT involves a fundamental shift in the practitioner’s world-view and cognitive schemas due to trauma exposure.",
                "Burnout is more severe than VT.",
                "VT is resolved by taking a vacation, while burnout requires therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vicarious Trauma is a transformation in the practitioner's inner experience (e.g., loss of trust in the world) specifically resulting from empathic engagement with clients' traumatic material."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "When a client begins to dissociate (glazing over), adding cognitive load (words) can worsen the state. Continuous tapping without words helps regulate the amygdala and brings the client back to the present."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "The 'ISPATH WARM' mnemonic is used for assessing suicide risk. What does the 'A' stand for in this clinical tool?",
