            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Ground & Integrate' phase in the EFT protocol?",
            "options": [
                "To uncover more repressed memories for the next session",
                "To ensure the client is within their Window of Tolerance before ending the session",
                "To convince the client that the tapping worked through logical argument",
                "To perform a final high-intensity round of tapping to clear remaining SUDs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'G' phase focuses on stabilization and safety, ensuring the client is grounded, regulated, and within their Window of Tolerance (Ogden et al.) before leaving the clinical environment."

            "question": "In the neurobiology of emotional integration, what is the significance of the 'reconsolidation window'?",
            "options": [
                "It is a 10-minute period where the brain is immune to new information",
                "It is a 4-to-6 hour period where the memory trace is labile and can be updated",
                "It is the time it takes for the amygdala to completely shut down",
                "It is the 24-hour sleep cycle required to forget a traumatic event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into memory reconsolidation (Nader et al.) shows that once a memory is retrieved, it enters a labile state for approximately 4-6 hours, during which tapping can help 'rewrite' the emotional charge."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A client feels 'floaty' and disconnected from their body after a session. Which somatic grounding technique is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the client to close their eyes and visualize a bright light",
                "Having the client perform rapid breathing exercises",
                "Using proprioceptive input, such as pushing feet into the floor or feeling the chair's texture",
                "Immediately starting another round of tapping on 'this floating feeling'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic grounding utilizes sensory and proprioceptive input to bring a dissociative or 'floaty' client back into their physical body and the present moment."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Choice Protocol' developed by Dr. Patricia Carrington, when should the 'Positive Choice' be introduced?",
            "options": [
                "At the very beginning of the session to set a goal",
                "Only after the intensity of the negative emotion has been reduced to a SUDs of 2 or lower",
                "Whenever the practitioner feels the client is being too negative",
                "In the middle of every round to balance the 'bad' with the 'good'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Choice Protocol requires clearing the 'clutter' (the negative charge) first. Introducing a positive choice too early creates cognitive dissonance and is usually ineffective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A client whose SUDs went from a 9 to a 0 claims, 'I don't think the tapping did it; I think I just realized it wasn't a big deal.' This is an example of:",
            "options": [
                "The Placebo Effect",
                "The Apex Effect",
                "Cognitive Dissonance Recovery",
                "The Zeigarnik Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when a client experiences a significant shift but attributes the change to external factors or downplays the original intensity because the brain has re-categorized the memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "If a session must end while a client is still processing a 'stuck' or high-intensity memory, which containment strategy is recommended?",
            "options": [
                "The 'Mental Box' or 'Safe Container' technique",
                "Telling the client to 'just not think about it' until next week",
                "Continuing the session for another hour regardless of the schedule",
                "Giving the client a sedative to ensure they remain calm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Containment strategies like the 'Mental Box' allow the client to symbolically store 'unfinished business' in a safe place until the next session, preventing emotional flooding between appointments."

            "id": "q7_7",

            "options": [
                "The sound of the practitioner's voice in the client's head",
                "The immediate return of all symptoms within 5 minutes of leaving",
                "New insights, dreams, or minor emotional releases that occur 24-48 hours after tapping",
                "The client repeating the setup phrase over and over unconsciously"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Echo Effect (or processing lag) describes the continued neural and emotional integration that occurs as the nervous system settles into its new, regulated state post-session."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "A 2019 study on practitioner hygiene found that what percentage of trauma-exposed professionals experienced secondary traumatic stress without proper grounding?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 37%",
                "Over 85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific data (e.g., Molnar et al., 2019) suggests that roughly 37% of practitioners in trauma-heavy fields experience significant secondary stress, highlighting the need for 'Grounding the Professional.'"

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which brain region is primarily responsible for the 'Cognitive Shift'—the moment a client gains a new, healthier perspective on a trauma?",
            "options": [
                "The Brainstem",
                "The Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vmPFC is responsible for executive function and emotional regulation; it 'comes back online' once the amygdala is calmed, allowing for new cognitive insights and reframes."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Practitioner Hygiene,' why is it recommended to 'shake off' or wash hands after a session?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the spread of physical bacteria only",
                "To satisfy a client's ritualistic expectations",
                "To provide a physical 'pattern interrupt' and symbolically reset the practitioner's energy",
                "Because EFT tapping points are known to accumulate toxins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physical movement or 'shaking' serves as a somatic pattern interrupt for the practitioner, helping them release the 'held' energy of the client's session and maintain professional boundaries."
