        {
            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "The Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), foundational to EFT assessment, was originally developed by which clinical researcher?",
            "options": ["Gary Craig", "Joseph Wolpe", "Roger Callahan", "Dawson Church"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Joseph Wolpe developed the SUDS scale in 1969 as a tool for measuring the subjective intensity of anxiety and distress in clinical settings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client reports an intensity of '12' on a 0-10 scale. According to Module 2, what is the most appropriate practitioner response?",
            "options": ["Correct the client and tell them the scale only goes to 10", "Ignore the number and start tapping immediately", "Acknowledge the extreme intensity and use it as a sign of hyper-arousal", "Divide the number by two to fit the standard 0-10 scale"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client goes 'off-scale,' it indicates high emotional flooding or hyper-arousal. The practitioner should acknowledge this high state of distress rather than correcting the client's math."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When assessing somatic indicators, which physiological change is often a primary sign that the nervous system is shifting from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance?",
            "options": ["Increased heart rate", "Spontaneous sighing or yawning", "Muscle constriction in the shoulders", "Rapid, shallow breathing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spontaneous sighing, yawning, or a deep 'cleansing breath' are classic somatic indicators that the nervous system is regulating and releasing tension."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the context of the VOC (Validity of Cognition) scale, what does a score of '7' represent?",
            "options": ["Maximum emotional distress", "The belief feels completely false", "The belief feels totally true", "The client is experiencing the Apex Effect"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike the SUDS scale (0-10), the VOC scale usually runs 1-7, where 7 means a positive statement or cognition feels completely and 'totally true' to the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client experiences a significant drop in distress from an 8 to a 2, but then claims, 'I think it just went away on its own because I got tired of talking about it.' This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Cognitive Dissonance", "The Apex Effect", "The Placebo Response", "Somatic Compliance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Apex Effect occurs when a client experiences a profound shift but cognitively dismisses the role of EFT, attributing the change to outside factors or claiming the problem 'wasn't that bad' to begin with."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which assessment tool is most recommended for children or clients who struggle with verbalizing their internal emotional state?",
            "options": ["The 1-7 VOC Scale", "Standardized SOAP Notes", "Visual Analog Scales (e.g., color gradients or face icons)", "The 1969 Wolpe Methodology"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visual Analog Scales, such as the Wong-Baker Faces or color-coded thermometers, provide a non-verbal way for clients to communicate intensity without needing precise numerical language."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Iterative Assessment Loop,' when should a practitioner ideally check the SUDS level?",
            "options": ["Only at the beginning and end of the hour-long session", "After every single tapping point", "After each complete round of tapping on a specific aspect", "Only when the client stops crying"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EFT is an iterative process. Reassessing the SUDS after each round (or 'loop') allows the practitioner to track progress and identify if new aspects have emerged."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In clinical documentation (SOAP notes), where should the client's reported SUDS and VOC scores be recorded?",
            "options": ["S - Subjective", "O - Objective", "A - Assessment", "P - Plan"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "SUDS and VOC scores are subjective self-reports from the client, and therefore belong in the 'Subjective' section of clinical SOAP notes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "If a client says 'I don't know' when asked for an intensity number, which 'bridge' technique is most effective for bypassing this resistance?",
            "options": ["Tell them to wait until they are sure", "Ask them to 'Take a guess' or 'Estimate if you did know'", "End the session as they are not ready for EFT", "Explain the neuroscience of the amygdala until they comply"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asking a client to 'guess' or 'estimate' lowers the pressure of 'getting it right,' which often bypasses the analytical mind and accesses the intuitive, somatic felt-sense."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on EFT assessment found that practitioners who consistently use the iterative loop (test-tap-retest) see what percentage increase in client-reported breakthrough clarity?",
            "options": ["15%", "22%", "38%", "50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that consistent iterative testing leads to a 38% increase in identifying 'hidden aspects,' which directly correlates to client breakthroughs."
