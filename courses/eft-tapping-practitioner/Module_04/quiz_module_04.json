            "question": "The Eyebrow (EB) point is located at the beginning of which meridian, and what is its primary emotional focus in EFT?",
            "options": [
                "Bladder Meridian; releasing trauma, frustration, and impatience",
                "Stomach Meridian; grounding and reducing anxiety",
                "Gallbladder Meridian; clearing mental fog",
                "Kidney Meridian; boosting vital energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Eyebrow point is the start of the Bladder Meridian (BL1). In EFT clinical practice, it is primarily used to address emotional states of frustration, impatience, and the release of traumatic 'stuckness'."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the 2020 replication study by Stapleton et al., a 60-minute EFT session resulted in what percentage decrease in salivary cortisol levels compared to the control group?",
            "options": [
                "14%",
                "24%",
                "43%",
                "58%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2020 study (n=53) found a 43% decrease in cortisol levels after one hour of EFT, significantly higher than the 14% reduction found in the psychoeducation group, highlighting the neurological impact of the point sequence."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The 'Collarbone' (CB) point is not actually on the bone but in the indentation below the u-shaped notch. Which specific acupuncture point does this represent?",
            "options": [
                "CV 17 (Conception Vessel)",
                "K 27 (Kidney 27)",
                "ST 12 (Stomach 12)",
                "LU 1 (Lung 1)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CB point targets Kidney 27 (K27), a critical point in the meridian system for 'un-reversing' energy and boosting the immune response to stress."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "When considering the mechanics of tapping (Lesson 6), what is the clinically recommended tempo for percussive stimulation on the meridian points?",
            "options": [
                "60-80 taps per minute (Slow/Resting Heart Rate)",
                "120-180 taps per minute (Approximately 2-3 taps per second)",
                "300+ taps per minute (Rapid vibration)",
                "The tempo does not matter as long as the point is touched"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Optimal percussive stimulation is generally achieved at a rhythm of 2-3 taps per second (120-180 BPM), which provides sufficient mechanical signal to the mechanoreceptors without causing tissue irritation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "What is the primary neurological function of the 'Reminder Phrase' during the tapping sequence?",
            "options": [
                "To distract the client from the physical sensation of tapping",
                "To provide positive affirmations to override negative thoughts",
                "To maintain exposure to the specific stressor, keeping the amygdala 'online' while the tapping sends a calming signal",
                "To improve the client's vocabulary and emotional intelligence"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Reminder Phrase ensures 'Targeted Exposure.' By voicing the problem, the amygdala stays engaged with the threat; the simultaneous tapping sends a counter-signal of safety, facilitating the 'extinction' of the stress response."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "The Under Arm (UA) point is located approximately 4 inches below the armpit. Which meridian does this point stimulate, and what is its clinical significance?",
            "options": [
                "Heart Meridian; for releasing grief",
                "Liver Meridian; for processing anger",
                "Spleen Meridian; for clearing obsessive worrying and self-doubt",
                "Triple Warmer; for regulating the fight-or-flight response"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The UA point (SP 21) is on the Spleen Meridian. In EFT, it is vital for addressing 'over-thinking,' worry, and the inability to digest life experiences or emotions."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "If a client reports that tapping on the right side of their face feels 'wrong' or 'ineffective,' what does Module 4, Lesson 8 suggest regarding sequence variations?",
            "options": [
                "The client must use the right side as it is the 'dominant' meridian path",
                "The client should tap only on the center-line points (Chin and Nose)",
                "The meridians are bilateral; the practitioner should encourage the client to switch sides or use both hands to tap symmetrically",
                "The practitioner should stop the session as this indicates a neurological blockage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EFT meridians are symmetrical. Research shows no significant difference in efficacy between left-side, right-side, or bilateral tapping. Practitioners should allow the client to use whichever side feels most comfortable."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which point in the sequence is referred to as 'Bai Hui' or 'Hundred Convergences' and is used to anchor the sequence and integrate the work?",
            "options": [
                "The Crown (CR) point",
                "The Under Eye (UE) point",
                "The Karate Chop (KC) point",
                "The Wrist point"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Crown point (GV 20) is known in TCM as Bai Hui. It is the meeting point of all 'Yang' meridians and serves as a powerful integration point in the EFT sequence."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving a client with a phobia of public speaking, the practitioner notices the client's SUDs level remains at an 8 despite three rounds of tapping. What is the most likely troubleshooting step based on the 'P' sequence mechanics?",
            "options": [
                "The tapping pressure is too light to trigger mechanoreceptors",
                "The Reminder Phrase is too general and needs more specificity",
                "The client is tapping in the wrong order",
                "The client needs to tap for at least 20 minutes without stopping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While mechanics matter, the most common reason for a 'stuck' SUDs level in the EFT sequence is a lack of specificity in the Reminder Phrase. If the phrase doesn't 'aim' at the specific emotional driver, the tapping cannot desensitize the response."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "The Under Eye (UE) point (Stomach Meridian) is particularly effective for which of the following clinical presentations?",
            "options": [
                "Acute rage and physical aggression",
                "Deep-seated grief and inability to cry",
                "Fear, anxiety, and 'butterflies' in the stomach",
                "Lower back pain and kidney issues"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Under Eye point (ST 1) on the Stomach Meridian is the primary point for addressing fear, social anxiety, and the physical manifestations of nervousness often felt in the gut."
