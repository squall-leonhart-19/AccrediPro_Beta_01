            "question": "According to the 'Science of Specificity,' why is tapping on a global statement like 'I'm stressed' often ineffective?",
            "options": [
                "It fails to trigger the amygdala's neural reconsolidation process for a specific memory.",
                "It requires too many tapping rounds to see any reduction in SUDs.",
                "The client's subconscious mind does not understand the word 'stress'.",
                "Global statements increase cortisol levels rather than decreasing them."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Specificity is key because neural reconsolidation requires the activation of a specific neural pathway. Global statements are too broad to trigger the precise 'mismatch' needed to rewire the amygdala's response."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the 'Table Legs Metaphor,' what do the 'legs' represent in relation to a client's core issue?",
            "options": [
                "The physical symptoms the client is currently experiencing.",
                "Specific past events or memories that support and reinforce a limiting belief.",
                "The various practitioners the client has seen in the past.",
                "The secondary gains the client receives from staying stuck."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Tabletop' is the global issue or belief (e.g., 'I am a failure'), while the 'legs' are the specific, sensory-based memories that provide evidence for that belief."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When practicing Somatic Targeting, if a client says they feel 'anxious,' what is the most effective follow-up question to use the 'Body as a Compass'?",
            "options": [
                "How long have you felt this way?",
                "Why do you think you are feeling anxious right now?",
                "If that anxiety were located in your body, where would it be and what does it feel like?",
                "On a scale of 1 to 10, how much does that anxiety bother you?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic targeting moves from abstract emotions to physical sensations. Identifying the location and quality (pressure, heat, tightness) provides a concrete target for the tapping."

            "question": "What is the primary difference between a 'Primary Emotion' and a 'Secondary Emotion' in EFT precision?",
            "options": [
                "Primary emotions are always felt in the head, while secondary are in the gut.",
                "Primary emotions are the first ones mentioned, while secondary are mentioned later.",
                "Secondary emotions (like anger) often mask more vulnerable primary emotions (like fear or shame).",
                "Primary emotions require 5 rounds of tapping, while secondary only require 2."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional precision involves peeling back layers. Often, a client presents with anger (secondary) to protect themselves from the underlying hurt or fear (primary) which is the true target."

            "id": "q1_5",

            "options": [
                "The entire duration of the traumatic day.",
                "A specific segment lasting no more than 2 to 3 minutes.",
                "Exactly 10 minutes to ensure all details are covered.",
                "There is no time limit as long as the client keeps talking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Movie Technique works best when isolating a short, specific segment (2-3 minutes) with a clear beginning, middle, and end to prevent the client from becoming overwhelmed (flooding)."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Why does 'Clean Language' require using the client's exact vocabulary instead of professional paraphrasing?",
            "options": [
                "It saves the practitioner time in note-taking.",
                "Paraphrasing can inadvertently introduce the practitioner's biases and miss the client's unique neural encoding.",
                "Clients feel insulted if you use words they didn't choose.",
                "Paraphrasing is only allowed in Advanced Level 3 EFT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clean Language preserves the client's internal symbolic representation. Using their exact words (e.g., 'shattered' instead of 'broken') ensures you are targeting the exact 'node' in their mental map."

                "The physical sensation felt at the end of a tapping round.",
                "A client's tendency to show up late for sessions.",
                "The internal 'but...' or cynical thought that follows a positive affirmation.",
                "The very last memory in a chronological chain of events."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tail-enders are the 'yes, but' responses (e.g., 'I am worthy... BUT I lost my job'). These represent the actual limiting beliefs that need to be targeted with EFT."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "During the 'Targeted Intake' (the first 5 minutes), what is the practitioner's main objective?",
            "options": [
                "To build rapport by sharing their own personal trauma history.",
                "To explain the entire history and meridian system of EFT.",
                "To identify at least one specific event (a 'Table Leg') to begin working on immediately.",
                "To have the client sign all legal waivers and payment forms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first 5 minutes should focus on moving from the 'Global' story to a specific, actionable target. The goal is to find a 'Table Leg' quickly to demonstrate the efficacy of the tool."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah has a fear of public speaking. She says, 'I just feel like everyone is judging me.' Which approach demonstrates the 'Generalization Effect'?",
            "options": [
                "Tapping on every single time she spoke in public since childhood.",
                "Tapping on 3-5 key specific memories of being judged; once these collapse, the global fear often disappears.",
                "Tapping only on the physical sensation of her throat closing up.",
                "Tapping on the phrase 'Everyone is judging me' for 60 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Generalization Effect states that after successfully clearing 3 to 5 specific related memories (table legs), the brain often generalizes the healing to the entire issue (the tabletop)."

            "id": "q1_10": "Which of the following is a 'Specific Event' suitable for the Movie Technique?",

                "'I have suffered from general anxiety for the last ten years.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A specific event must have a specific time, a specific place, and a specific 'crescendo' or 'sting'. Option C is the only one that meets the criteria for a targeted 'Movie'."
