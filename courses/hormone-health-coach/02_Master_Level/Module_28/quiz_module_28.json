            "question": "When utilizing the Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS) for suspected thyroid storm, what score indicates that a 'Thyroid Storm' is highly likely and requires immediate emergency intervention?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 10-15 points",
                "A score of 20-25 points",
                "A score of 45 points or greater",
                "A score of 30-40 points"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A BWPS score of 45 or greater is highly suggestive of a thyroid storm, while 25-44 suggests impending storm. This tool assesses thermoregulatory dysfunction, CNS effects, gastrointestinal-hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular parameters."

            "question": "A client with known Addison's disease presents with sudden hypotension (85/50 mmHg), severe lower back pain, and vomiting after a bout of the flu. What is the most likely neuroendocrine emergency?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Storm",
                "Acute Adrenal Crisis (Addisonian Crisis)",
                "Myxedema Coma",
                "Phaeochromocytoma Crisis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acute Adrenal Crisis is often triggered by physiological stress (infection, surgery, or injury) in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Key indicators include profound hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and severe pain."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "What is the primary clinical distinction between Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) and Premenstrual Exacerbation (PME)?",
            "options": [
                "PMDD only involves physical symptoms, while PME involves mental health.",
                "PME is a worsening of a continuous underlying disorder (like MDD or GAD), while PMDD symptoms are strictly cyclical and disappear after menses.",
                "PMDD occurs during the follicular phase, while PME occurs during the luteal phase.",
                "PME is treated with hormones, while PMDD is only treated with SSRIs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMDD is a distinct cyclical affective disorder where symptoms are absent in the follicular phase. PME refers to the premenstrual worsening of the symptoms of another ongoing disorder, such as Major Depressive Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Non-Responder' Protocol (L4), if a client shows 0% improvement in objective markers after 90 days of consistent adherence, what is the first area of 'Hidden Inflammation' the coach should investigate?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing exercise intensity",
                "Reducing caloric intake further",
                "Environmental toxicity (mold, heavy metals, or occult infections)",
                "Switching to a different brand of multivitamins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Non-Responder' protocol prioritizes investigating 'upstream' drivers of systemic inflammation, such as mycotoxins (mold), chronic infections (Lyme, EBV), or heavy metal toxicity, which can block hormonal receptor sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In 'Triple-Threat' cases involving the HPA (Adrenal), HPT (Thyroid), and HPG (Gonadal) axes, why is the HPA axis typically prioritized in the first phase of recovery?",
            "options": [
                "Because cortisol is the only hormone that matters for weight loss.",
                "Because thyroid hormone replacement can exacerbate an underlying adrenal insufficiency, potentially triggering a crisis.",
                "Because sex hormones cannot be measured if cortisol is high.",
                "Because the HPT axis does not respond to lifestyle changes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the HPT (Thyroid) axis without ensuring HPA (Adrenal) stability can be dangerous; increasing metabolic rate via thyroid support in a client with depleted adrenals can lead to an adrenal crisis."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "How does systemic 'Estrogen Dominance' typically influence the immune system in clients with Th2-dominant autoimmune conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?",
            "options": [
                "It suppresses all immune activity equally.",
                "It shifts the balance further toward Th2, potentially increasing autoantibody production and triggering flares.",
                "It increases Th1 activity, which cures the Th2 dominance.",
                "Estrogen has no effect on T-helper cell differentiation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of estrogen generally promote a Th2 immune response. In Th2-dominant conditions like Lupus, this can exacerbate the disease, whereas in Th1-dominant conditions (like some forms of RA), it may occasionally offer temporary symptom relief."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A breast cancer survivor on Anastrozole (an Aromatase Inhibitor) reports severe arthralgia (joint pain) and a recent DEXA scan showing a T-score of -2.1. What physiological mechanism is driving these symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive progesterone levels",
                "The complete suppression of estrogen, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and RANKL-mediated bone resorption.",
                "A side effect of chemotherapy that occurred 5 years ago.",
                "High testosterone levels caused by the medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) block the conversion of androgens to estrogens. This profound estrogen deprivation leads to 'AI-Induced Musculoskeletal Syndrome' (AIMSS) and accelerated bone loss due to the loss of estrogen's protective effect on bone and joint tissue."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Under the 'Ethical Crisis Management' framework (L8), if a client mentions 'not wanting to be here anymore' during a session, what is the coach's mandatory immediate action?",
            "options": [
                "Adjust their magnesium dosage to help with mood.",
                "Perform a 'Deep Dive' into their childhood trauma.",
                "Implement a crisis triage protocol, refer to emergency services/hotlines, and notify their clinical care team.",
                "Wait until the next session to see if the feeling passes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within their scope. Suicidal ideation is a clinical emergency requiring immediate referral to qualified mental health professionals or emergency services. Coaching must be suspended until the client is stabilized by a clinician."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Multi-Endocrine Synchrony' found that what percentage of women with PCOS also demonstrate subclinical or overt Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 25-30%",
                "Nearly 80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a significant overlap between PCOS and Hashimoto's, with studies showing a prevalence of 25-30% (roughly 3x the rate of the general population), necessitating screening for both in complex cases."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Clinical Red Flag' that requires a coach to pause the program and insist on medical clearance before proceeding?",

                "A desire to switch from coffee to herbal tea."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Unintentional, rapid weight loss is a major red flag for underlying malignancies, metabolic crises, or severe systemic disease, requiring immediate medical investigation."
