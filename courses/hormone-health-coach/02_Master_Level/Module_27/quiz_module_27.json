            "question": "In high-performance athletics, what is the primary physiological driver of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive protein consumption leading to kidney strain",
                "Low energy availability (LEA) disrupting the GnRH pulse generator",
                "High testosterone levels causing premature growth plate closure",
                "Overtraining leading to permanent adrenal insufficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S is driven by low energy availability (LEA), where the body does not have enough energy to support both exercise and normal physiological functions, leading to the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and GnRH pulsatility."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Phenotype A (Classic PCOS) involves all three Rotterdam criteria and is statistically associated with the highest levels of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and long-term metabolic risk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postpartum Thyroiditis affects approximately 5-10% of women, though the prevalence is significantly higher (up to 25%) in women with Type 1 Diabetes."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "When assessing HRT options for a perimenopausal client with a history of migraines and high BMI, why is transdermal estradiol often preferred over oral delivery?",
            "options": [
                "It bypasses the first-pass hepatic metabolism and does not increase VTE risk",
                "It is more effective at building bone density than oral forms",
                "It specifically targets the ovaries while oral targets the uterus",
                "It is the only form that contains bioidentical progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Transdermal estradiol bypasses the liver's first-pass metabolism, which prevents the increase in clotting factors and C-reactive protein, making it safer regarding Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) risk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endometriosis involves a pro-inflammatory environment where cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 are significantly elevated, promoting lesion growth and pain."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tributyltin (TBT) and PFAS are classic examples of obesogens that interfere with metabolic signaling, specifically the PPAR-gamma receptor, leading to increased fat storage."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In the context of PMDD, what is the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism regarding the metabolite Allopregnanolone (ALLO)?",
            "options": [
                "PMDD patients have an absolute deficiency of ALLO",
                "PMDD patients have excessively high levels of ALLO compared to controls",
                "PMDD patients have an abnormal GABA-A receptor sensitivity to normal fluctuations of ALLO",
                "ALLO is converted into testosterone in the brains of PMDD patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that women with PMDD do not have abnormal hormone levels, but rather a paradoxical or hypersensitive reaction of the GABA-A receptor to normal fluctuations of the progesterone metabolite ALLO."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 28-year-old female athlete presents with secondary amenorrhea, a BMI of 18.5, and a Cortisol:DHEA ratio of 0.7. What is the most likely interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "She has PCOS Phenotype D",
                "She is in a catabolic state due to overtraining and/or under-fueling",
                "She has high androgen levels and should be screened for hirsutism",
                "She is in early perimenopause"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high Cortisol:DHEA ratio (>0.5) in an athlete, combined with low BMI and amenorrhea, strongly suggests a catabolic state and HPO axis suppression (RED-S)."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Preconception Mastery' framework, what is the recommended minimum duration for lifestyle and nutritional interventions to impact sperm and egg quality?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Spermatogenesis takes approximately 74-90 days, and the final maturation of an oocyte takes about 90-120 days; therefore, 3-4 months is the minimum window for significant quality improvements."
