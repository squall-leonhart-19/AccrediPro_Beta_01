            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "In the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, which specific glucose transporter fails to translocate to the cell membrane in response to insulin signaling?",
            "options": ["GLUT1", "GLUT2", "GLUT3", "GLUT4"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "GLUT4 is the primary insulin-regulated glucose transporter found in adipose tissue and striated muscle. In insulin-resistant states, the signaling pathway (PI3K/Akt) is impaired, preventing GLUT4 from moving to the cell surface to facilitate glucose uptake."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Leptin resistance is characterized by high circulating leptin levels but a failure to suppress appetite. This occurs primarily through the inhibition of which neuronal pathway in the hypothalamus?",
            "options": ["Activation of POMC neurons and inhibition of AgRP/NPY neurons", "Inhibition of POMC neurons and activation of AgRP/NPY neurons", "Activation of Ghrelin receptors in the pituitary", "Inhibition of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) pathway"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin normally stimulates POMC (anorexigenic) and inhibits AgRP/NPY (orexigenic) neurons. In resistance, the brain fails to receive the 'fullness' signal, leading to the continued activation of hunger-promoting AgRP neurons."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 3.8. Based on clinical standards, how should this result be interpreted?",
            "options": ["Optimal insulin sensitivity", "Early signs of insulin sensitivity", "Moderate insulin resistance", "Severe insulin resistance"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose / 405) under 1.0 is optimal. Scores above 1.9 indicate early resistance, while scores above 2.9 (including 3.8) indicate significant or moderate-to-severe insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Adipose tissue is a dynamic endocrine organ. Which adipokine is considered 'cardioprotective' and is typically decreased in individuals with metabolic syndrome?",
            "options": ["Resistin", "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)", "Adiponectin", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity and has anti-inflammatory effects. Unlike most adipokines, its levels decrease as visceral fat mass increases."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "According to research on the 'Glucose Goddess' method and acetic acid, consuming 15-30ml of vinegar before a carbohydrate-rich meal can reduce the postprandial glucose spike by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "Up to 30%", "Over 60%", "It has no measurable effect on glucose"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies have shown that acetic acid (vinegar) can reduce postprandial glucose and insulin responses by approximately 30% by slowing gastric emptying and inhibiting alpha-amylase activity."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When utilizing a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) for a non-diabetic client, what is the recommended 'Time in Range' (70–110 mg/dL) for achieving peak metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [">70%", ">80%", ">90%", ">95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While standard clinical guidelines for diabetics often target >70% in a wider range, elite metabolic health coaching targets >95% 'Time in Range' within a tighter window (70-110 mg/dL) to minimize glycemic variability."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Metabolic flexibility is defined as the body's ability to switch between fuel sources. A Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70 during a fasted state indicates which of the following?",
            "options": ["Pure carbohydrate oxidation", "Pure lipid (fat) oxidation", "Mixed fuel utilization", "Anaerobic glycolysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that 100% of the fuel being oxidized is fat. An RER of 1.0 indicates 100% carbohydrate oxidation. A healthy metabolically flexible individual should be close to 0.70 while fasted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Which nutritional timing strategy has been clinically shown to improve insulin sensitivity and β-cell function specifically by aligning with the body's natural circadian rhythm of glucose tolerance?",
            "options": ["Late-night caloric loading", "Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF)", "Eating 6 small meals per day", "Standard 16:8 fasting with an 8 PM cutoff"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "eTRF (e.g., eating from 8 AM to 2 PM) aligns food intake with the morning peak of insulin sensitivity, leading to better glycemic control compared to late-shifted eating windows."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) contributes to blood sugar precision through which of the following mechanisms?",
            "options": ["Stimulating glucagon release from alpha cells", "Slowing gastric emptying and increasing satiety", "Increasing hepatic glucose production", "Accelerating the breakdown of muscle tissue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that enhances insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon, slows gastric emptying, and signals satiety to the brain."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to insulin resistance through the accumulation of which metabolites that interfere with insulin signaling?",
            "options": ["Amino acids and ketones", "Diacylglycerols (DAGs) and ceramides", "Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate", "Magnesium and Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When mitochondria cannot efficiently oxidize fats, lipid intermediates like diacylglycerols (DAGs) and ceramides accumulate in the cell, activating stress kinases (like PKC-theta) that block the insulin signaling pathway."
