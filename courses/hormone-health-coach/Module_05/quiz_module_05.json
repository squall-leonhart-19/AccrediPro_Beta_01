            "question": "In the AccrediPro 'Maintain & Thrive' philosophy, what is the primary distinction between the 'Intervention' phase and the 'Maintenance' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Intervention focuses on symptom suppression, while maintenance focuses on medication management.",
                "Maintenance shifts from active therapeutic correction to the automation of metabolic flexibility and lifestyle habits.",
                "Intervention is for younger clients, while maintenance is reserved for post-menopausal or older clients.",
                "Maintenance requires stricter caloric restriction than the intervention phase to prevent weight regain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintenance is characterized by moving away from intensive therapeutic protocols toward sustainable, automated habits that support metabolic flexibility and long-term hormonal homeostasis."

            "question": "During the transition from perimenopause to menopause, what is the physiological reason for increasing dietary protein to 1.2–1.5g/kg of body weight?",
            "options": [
                "To counteract the decline in estrogen, which reduces the efficiency of muscle protein synthesis.",
                "To increase the thermic effect of food and induce rapid weight loss.",
                "To provide enough substrate for increased cortisol production during night sweats.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Declining estrogen levels reduce the anabolic stimulus for muscle growth; therefore, higher protein intake is required to maintain skeletal muscle mass and prevent sarcopenia."

            "question": "A client's Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has dropped significantly below their 30-day baseline. Based on the Stress Resilience lesson, what does this likely indicate?",

                "The client has achieved a state of deep parasympathetic dominance.",
                "The HPA axis is well-rested and ready for high-intensity training.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV typically indicates that the autonomic nervous system is under stress, signaling sympathetic dominance and a need for recovery."

            "question": "The 'Maintenance Micro-Nutrient Protocol' emphasizes Magnesium for over 300 enzymatic reactions. Which form is specifically recommended for supporting the HPA axis and sleep quality due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier?",
