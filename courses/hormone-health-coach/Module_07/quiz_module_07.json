        {
            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which thyroid hormone is considered the biologically active form responsible for the majority of intracellular metabolic signaling?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroxine (T4)",
                "Triiodothyronine (T3)",
                "Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While T4 is produced in higher quantities (roughly 80%), T3 is the biologically active form that is 3 to 4 times more potent and binds to nuclear receptors to regulate gene expression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In the context of deiodination, what is the primary function of the Type 3 Deiodinase (D3) enzyme?",
            "options": [
                "Converting T4 into active T3 in the liver",
                "Converting T4 into Reverse T3 (rT3) to slow metabolism",
                "Converting TSH into TRH in the hypothalamus",
                "Transporting iodine into the follicular cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The D3 enzyme acts as a metabolic 'brake' by converting T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3) and converting T3 into T2, effectively reducing metabolic activity during periods of stress or illness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to clinical data discussed in Lesson 3, approximately what percentage of hypothyroidism cases in iodine-sufficient populations are attributed to Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis?",
            "options": [
                "25-30%",
                "50-55%",
                "70-75%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In iodine-sufficient regions like North America, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis is the leading cause of hypothyroidism, accounting for approximately 90-95% of cases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client presents with high-normal TSH and low-normal Free T3, despite adequate Iodine intake. Which mineral is most critical as a cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 to T3?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Selenium",
                "Manganese",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a mandatory constituent of the selenoproteins (deiodinases) responsible for the peripheral conversion of T4 to active T3, and it also protects the thyroid from oxidative damage during hormone synthesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "How does chronic activation of the HPA-axis (elevated cortisol) specifically impact thyroid physiology?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of thyroid receptors",
                "It stimulates the production of TSH in the pituitary",
                "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, increasing rT3 production",
                "It accelerates the clearance of TPO antibodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which reduces the conversion of T4 to active T3 and instead promotes the conversion of T4 into the inactive rT3, contributing to 'euthyroid sick syndrome' or functional hypothyroidism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which group of environmental toxins are known as 'halogens' that competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid gland?",
            "options": [
                "Lead, Mercury, and Cadmium",
                "BPA and Phthalates",
                "Fluoride, Bromide, and Chlorine",
                "Organophosphates and Glyphosate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Bromide, and Chlorine are chemically similar to Iodine (all are halogens) and can occupy iodine receptors on the thyroid, preventing the gland from utilizing iodine for hormone synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "A 38-year-old female client has a TSH of 6.2 mIU/L and a Free T4 of 1.1 ng/dL (within the laboratory reference range). How is this condition clinically classified?",
            "options": [
                "Overt Hypothyroidism",
                "Subclinical Hypothyroidism",
                "Secondary Hypothyroidism",
                "Euthyroid State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH (typically >4.5 mIU/L) in the presence of a Free T4 level that remains within the standard laboratory reference range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "What percentage of T4 to T3 conversion is estimated to occur in a healthy gut via the action of the enzyme intestinal sulfatase?",

                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 80%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Approximately 20% of T4 is converted to active T3 in the gastrointestinal tract, provided there is healthy gut microbiota and sufficient intestinal sulfatase activity."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, which lifestyle intervention was shown to most effectively increase GLUT4 translocation and improve metabolic flexibility in thyroid-compromised clients?",
            "options": [
                "Strict ketogenic dieting",
                "Extended 48-hour fasting",
                "Resistance training (Hypertrophy/Strength)",
                "Low-intensity steady-state cardio (LISS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistance training increases muscle mass and GLUT4 expression, which improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic rate, counteracting the metabolic slowdown often seen in hypothyroid states."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Why is the presence of Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) antibodies significant even if TSH is currently within the 'standard' range (e.g., 3.5 mIU/L)?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates a high risk for future overt hypothyroidism and suggests active autoimmunity",
                "It proves the client is consuming too much iodine",
                "It means the client has Graves' disease rather than Hashimoto's",
                "It indicates that the pituitary gland is failing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "TPO antibodies are a marker of autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's). Their presence often precedes a rise in TSH by years and indicates that the immune system is actively attacking thyroid tissue, necessitating early intervention."
