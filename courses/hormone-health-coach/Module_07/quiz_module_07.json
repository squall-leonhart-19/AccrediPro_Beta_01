            "question": "In the context of the Insulin-Hormone Axis, how does hyperinsulinemia specifically contribute to hyperandrogenism in female clients?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin stimulates the pituitary to release more LH, while simultaneously increasing Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG).",
                "Insulin suppresses the production of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) in the liver, increasing the bioavailability of free testosterone.",
                "Insulin directly converts progesterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the adrenal glands.",
                "High insulin levels inhibit the enzyme aromatase, preventing the conversion of androgens into estrogens."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia is a primary driver of hormonal imbalance because it suppresses hepatic production of SHBG. Lower SHBG levels mean more testosterone remains 'free' and biologically active, contributing to symptoms of PCOS and androgen excess."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Pregnenolone Steal' or HPA-Axis Shunt concept discussed in Lesson 2, chronic stress prioritizes the production of cortisol at the expense of which hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin",
                "Glucagon",
                "Progesterone",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' occurs because cortisol and progesterone share the same precursor, pregnenolone. Under chronic stress, the body shunts pregnenolone toward cortisol production to ensure survival, often leading to a relative progesterone deficiency."

            "question": "When assessing Metabolic Flexibility using a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) via indirect calorimetry, what does a value of 0.70 indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The client is utilizing 100% glucose for fuel.",
                "The client is in a state of anaerobic glycolysis.",
                "The client is utilizing 100% lipid oxidation (fat-burning).",
                "The client is at the 'Crossover Point' where fuel sources are 50/50."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that the body is deriving 100% of its energy from fat oxidation. A value of 1.0 would indicate 100% carbohydrate oxidation, and 0.85 indicates a mixed fuel usage."

            "question": "A client's lab results show a Fasting Glucose of 95 mg/dL and a Fasting Insulin of 18 µIU/mL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and what does it suggest?",
            "options": [
                "Score: 1.2; This indicates optimal insulin sensitivity.",
                "Score: 2.5; This indicates early-stage insulin resistance.",
                "Score: 4.2; This indicates significant insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction.",
                "Score: 0.8; This indicates a risk for hypoglycemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calculation: (95 * 18) / 405 = 4.22. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while a score above 2.9 (and certainly 4.2) indicates significant insulin resistance."

            "question": "How does the timing of melatonin secretion interact with insulin sensitivity in the evening (Chrononutrition)?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin increases insulin sensitivity to prepare the body for overnight glucose storage.",
                "Melatonin binds to MT1/MT2 receptors on pancreatic beta cells, inhibiting insulin secretion.",
                "Melatonin stimulates glucagon release, causing a 'dawn phenomenon' spike.",
                "Melatonin has no direct interaction with the endocrine pancreas."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin naturally inhibits insulin secretion to prevent hypoglycemia during sleep. Eating late at night when melatonin is high results in prolonged postprandial hyperglycemia because the pancreas is 'asleep' and cannot respond effectively."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which nutritive strategy is emphasized in Lesson 6 for naturally increasing the incretin hormone GLP-1 to improve satiety and glucose handling?",
            "options": [
                "High-fat ketogenic dieting with low fiber intake.",
                "Consuming fermentable fibers (prebiotics) and viscous fibers.",
                "Exclusively using branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplements.",
                "Drinking distilled water between meals to dilute stomach acid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 is secreted by L-cells in the distal small intestine and colon in response to nutrients, particularly fermentable fibers and certain proteins. High fiber intake is a primary natural stimulus for GLP-1 release."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, 'Weight Loss Resistance' is often linked to Leptin Resistance. What is the primary mechanism of Leptin Resistance at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "A total lack of leptin production in adipose tissue.",
                "Upregulation of the OB-R receptor in the hypothalamus.",
                "Inflammation-induced impairment of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus, often involving the SOCS3 protein.",
                "Excessive conversion of leptin into ghrelin in the stomach lining."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leptin resistance occurs when the brain (hypothalamus) no longer 'sees' the leptin signal despite high levels in the blood. This is often caused by hypothalamic inflammation and the induction of SOCS3, which blocks leptin receptor signaling."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Which biomarker ratio is considered a powerful 'poor man’s' proxy for assessing atherogenic dyslipidemia and insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol / LDL Ratio",

                "Sodium / Potassium Ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Triglyceride to HDL ratio is an excellent marker for insulin resistance. A ratio >2.0 (in mg/dL) is often predictive of small, dense LDL particles and underlying metabolic syndrome."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'stubborn' abdominal weight gain, high evening cortisol, and low morning energy. Which 'Stress-Hormone Hijack' mechanism is likely inhibiting their thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol stimulating the 5'-deiodinase enzyme to produce more T3.",
                "Excess cortisol increasing the production of Reverse T3 (rT3), which blocks T3 receptors.",
                "Stress-induced iodine excretion through the kidneys.",
                "Low cortisol levels causing the thyroid to overproduce T4."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic high cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme (which converts T4 to T3) and instead promotes the 5-deiodinase pathway, which produces Reverse T3. rT3 is metabolically inactive and competes with active T3 for receptor sites."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of applying 'Hormetic Stressors' like cold exposure or Intermittent Fasting in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "To permanently lower cortisol to near-zero levels.",
                "To induce a controlled stress response that upregulates mitochondrial efficiency and antioxidant defenses (NRF2 pathway).",
                "To deplete glycogen stores so the body never uses glucose again.",
                "To increase the size of the adrenal glands to handle more stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is the concept that brief, controlled bouts of stress (like temperature extremes or fasting) trigger adaptive responses that build metabolic resilience, improve mitochondrial function, and activate the NRF2 longevity pathway."
