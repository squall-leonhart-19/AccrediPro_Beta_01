            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which water filtration technology is considered the 'gold standard' for removing 99% of contaminants, including PFAS (forever chemicals) and heavy metals that disrupt the endocrine system?",
            "options": [
                "Standard carbon pitcher filters",
                "Reverse Osmosis (RO) with remineralization",
                "UV light purification only",
                "Basic sediment filtration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While carbon filters help with taste and chlorine, Reverse Osmosis is required to effectively remove smaller molecules like PFAS, nitrates, and heavy metals. Remineralization is necessary to ensure the water remains pH-balanced and provides essential electrolytes."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client's Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is consistently low despite adequate sleep. According to Lesson 2, what does a low HRV typically indicate regarding the Autonomic Nervous System?",
            "options": [
                "Dominance of the Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "Optimal endocrine resilience",
                "Dominance of the Sympathetic Nervous System and reduced adaptive capacity",
                "High levels of circulating oxytocin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV is a proxy for the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. A low HRV indicates the body is 'stuck' in a stress response (sympathetic dominance) and lacks the resilience to recover effectively."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Oxytocin is often called the 'cuddle hormone,' but in Lesson 3, what is its primary physiological role in stress management?",
            "options": [
                "It directly increases the production of adrenaline",
                "It antagonizes the HPA axis by reducing cortisol secretion and amygdala reactivity",
                "It triggers the release of glucose from the liver",
                "It inhibits the production of thyroid hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin acts as a natural buffer to the stress response. It downregulates the HPA axis, lowers cortisol levels, and calms the amygdala (the brain's fear center), making social connection a biological necessity for hormonal health."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In the 'Relapse Prevention Model' discussed in Lesson 4, what is the 'Abstinence Violation Effect'?",
            "options": [
                "The physiological withdrawal symptoms from sugar",
                "The metabolic benefit of a 'cheat meal'",
                "A cognitive distortion where a minor lapse leads to a total abandonment of the protocol",
                "The body's increased sensitivity to toxins after a detox"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Abstinence Violation Effect occurs when a client views a small slip-up as a total failure ('I already ate one cookie, I might as well eat the whole box'), leading to a loss of self-efficacy and a full relapse."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which biohacking modality uses specific wavelengths (660nm and 850nm) to stimulate cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, potentially enhancing steroidogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "Cryotherapy",
                "Intermittent Fasting",
                "Photobiomodulation (Red Light Therapy)",
                "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Red and Near-Infrared light therapy (Photobiomodulation) stimulates the mitochondrial respiratory chain, increasing ATP production. In endocrine tissues like the testes or ovaries, this can support healthier hormone production levels."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Research on 'Eudaimonic Well-being' (living with purpose) shows a specific genetic expression pattern. What is this pattern called?",
            "options": [
                "The Cortisol Switch",
                "Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA)",

                "The Oxytocin Loop"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CTRA is a molecular signature characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and decreased expression of antiviral genes. Individuals with high 'purpose' (eudaimonic joy) show a reversal of this inflammatory pattern."

                "Cast iron cookware"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synthetic fragrances often contain phthalates (which disrupt androgen signaling) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) like benzene and formaldehyde, which contribute to the total toxic load on the liver."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "What is the core difference between 'Client Compliance' and 'Client Sovereignty' as taught in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "Compliance is about the client following the coach's rules; Sovereignty is about the client making informed choices based on internal wisdom",
                "Compliance is for beginners; Sovereignty is only for advanced biohackers",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms",
                "Compliance focuses on supplements; Sovereignty focuses on mindset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Compliance relies on external authority (the coach), which is fragile. Sovereignty empowers the client to understand their own biology and make decisions autonomously, which is the key to lifelong maintenance."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Which 'Blue Zone' habit is most closely linked to the regulation of the hormone DHEA and the reduction of age-related inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training",
                "Caloric restriction and 'Hara Hachi Bu'",
                "Consistent social engagement and 'Moais'",
                "Using advanced supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While diet is important, the 'Moais' (social support groups in Okinawa) provide the consistent oxytocin and safety signals that lower systemic inflammation and preserve DHEA levels into old age."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client, Maria, has mastered her nutrition but feels 'spiritually drained' and has stagnant weight loss. She spends 10 hours a day in a windowless office. What is the most 'Sovereign' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribing a higher dose of Vitamin D3",
                "Switching her to a ketogenic diet immediately",
                "Encouraging her to audit her environment for light exposure and 'Joy Gaps'",
                "Telling her she must quit her job to balance her hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering the client to perform their own audit (environment and emotional joy) fosters sovereignty. Addressing the lack of natural light (circadian rhythm) and purpose (joy gaps) addresses the root cause of her stagnation."
