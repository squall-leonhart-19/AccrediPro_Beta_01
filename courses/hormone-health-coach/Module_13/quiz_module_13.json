            "question": "Which principle of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) challenges the traditional toxicological adage that 'the dose makes the poison'?",
            "options": [
                "Linear dose-response curves",
                "Non-monotonic dose-response curves",
                "Acute toxicity thresholds",
                "The bioaccumulation plateau"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs often exhibit non-monotonic dose-response curves, meaning low doses can sometimes have more significant endocrine-disrupting effects than higher doses by interfering with delicate hormonal feedback loops."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of estrogen dominance. You suspect high exposure to xenoestrogens like Bisphenol A (BPA). How do these compounds primarily affect the Estrogen Receptor (ER)?",
            "options": [
                "They permanently destroy the receptor site",
                "They act as ligands that can mimic or block natural 17β-estradiol",
                "They prevent the liver from producing estrogen entirely",
                "They convert progesterone into estrogen via aromatization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens act as molecular mimics or ligands that bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), potentially triggering an estrogenic response or blocking natural estrogen from binding."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In the Liver-Hormone Axis, what is the primary risk of having a highly active Phase I (CYP450) pathway coupled with a sluggish Phase II conjugation pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins",
                "Immediate conversion of all toxins into bile",
                "The accumulation of highly reactive, toxic intermediate metabolites",
                "A significant increase in Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I 'activates' toxins into intermediate metabolites which are often more reactive and toxic than the original substance. If Phase II conjugation is slow, these intermediates can cause significant cellular and DNA damage."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. Which enzyme, if overproduced by these bacteria, leads to the recirculation of estrogen back into the bloodstream?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-amylase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Lipase",
                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that 'un-couples' conjugated estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation rather than excreted in the stool."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which group of elements on the periodic table is known to competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid gland due to their similar atomic structure?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Halogens like fluoride (water), bromide (flour/flame retardants), and chloride (pools) compete with iodine for the sodium-iodide symporter in the thyroid, potentially leading to hypothyroidism."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Cadmium is classified as a 'metalloestrogen.' What is a primary source of cadmium exposure that a coach should screen for in a client's history?",
            "options": [
                "Organic kale consumption",
                "Cigarette smoke and second-hand smoke",
                "Cast iron cookware",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cigarette smoke is a significant source of cadmium, a heavy metal that mimics estrogen and has been linked to increased risks of hormone-dependent cancers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcium D-Glucarate is metabolized into glucaric acid, which directly inhibits beta-glucuronidase, thereby facilitating the permanent excretion of estrogen through the GI tract."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Sulforaphane, found in broccoli sprouts, supports Phase II detoxification primarily by activating which cellular pathway?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a potent inducer of the Nrf2 pathway, which upregulates the production of Phase II detoxification enzymes and endogenous antioxidants like glutathione."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "When 'Clean Sweeping' a client's environment, why is the term 'Fragrance' or 'Parfum' on a label considered a red flag for hormone health?",
            "options": [
                "It always indicates the presence of heavy metals",
                "It is a proprietary term that often hides phthalates used as fixatives",
                "It means the product contains high levels of gluten",
                "It indicates the product is highly acidic"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to trade secret laws, companies can list 'Fragrance' as a single ingredient, which often contains a cocktail of phthalates—known endocrine disruptors used to make scents last longer."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client has high levels of 4-OH and 16-OH estrogen metabolites on a functional test. Which Phase II process should be prioritized to help safely neutralize these metabolites?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylation, governed by the COMT enzyme, is the primary Phase II pathway for neutralizing catechol estrogens (like 4-OH), converting them into safer, water-soluble methoxyestrogens."
