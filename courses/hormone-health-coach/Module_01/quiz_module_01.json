            "question": "In the B.L.O.O.M. Method™, what does the 'O' in the second position (Organismal) specifically assess within a client's baseline?",
            "options": [
                "Occupational stressors and workplace ergonomics",
                "Organic food consumption and pesticide exposure",
                "Biological systems, including the microbiome and gut-brain axis",
                "Ovulatory cycles and reproductive health markers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Organismal' pillar of the B.L.O.O.M. Method™ focuses on the internal biological environment, specifically the health of the microbiome, digestive efficiency, and the systemic integration of organs."

            "question": "When comparing diagnostic tools, why is Dried Urine (DUTCH) testing often preferred over Serum testing for assessing estrogen metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "Serum cannot measure estrogen at all",
                "Dried urine captures the metabolites (2-OH, 4-OH, 16-OH), showing how the body processes hormones",
                "Serum testing is more invasive and causes a cortisol spike that invalidates results",
                "Dried urine is the only way to measure total Bound Estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While serum measures circulating hormones, dried urine (DUTCH) provides a comprehensive look at phase I and phase II liver detoxification metabolites, which is critical for identifying risks associated with estrogen dominance."

            "question": "A client presents with a 'normal' TSH of 3.8 mIU/L but complains of fatigue and thinning hair. According to Functional Lab Analysis, why is this significant?",
            "options": [
                "The functional optimal range for TSH is typically 1.0 - 2.0 mIU/L, suggesting subclinical issues",
                "3.8 mIU/L is actually a hyperthyroid marker",
                "TSH is irrelevant if the client is still menstruating",
                "Functional ranges are wider than standard lab ranges to account for bio-individuality"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine utilizes narrower 'optimal' ranges (1.0 - 2.0 mIU/L for TSH) compared to standard lab reference ranges (0.5 - 4.5+ mIU/L) to identify dysfunction before it progresses to a disease state."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) describes a physiological priority where the body diverts hormonal precursors to the HPA axis at the expense of which other axis?",
            "options": [
                "The HPT (Thyroid) Axis",
                "The HPO (Ovarian) Axis",
                "The Gut-Brain Axis",
                "The HPG (Growth) Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes cortisol production (HPA axis) using shared precursors like pregnenolone, often leading to a deficiency in progesterone and sex hormones (HPO axis)."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "During the Advanced Symptom Mapping of a 44-year-old female, you note shortened cycles (24 days) and increased night sweats. This pattern most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Early Menarche",

                "Androgen Excess"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is characterized by fluctuating FSH levels and a decline in progesterone, often resulting in shorter cycles and vasomotor symptoms like night sweats due to estrogen withdrawal."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which specific statistic regarding Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) was highlighted as a primary concern for the 'Environmental Audit'?",
            "options": [
                "90% of household dust contains at least ten phthalates that interfere with thyroid signaling",
                "Only 2% of clients are affected by BPA in plastics",
                "EDCs have no impact on the HPA axis, only the HPO axis",
                "Phthalates increase testosterone in women by 40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are ubiquitous 'obesogens' and thyroid disruptors; studies show they are present in the vast majority of indoor environments and significantly impact endocrine signaling."

            "question": "When evaluating the HPT (Thyroid) Axis, a high level of Reverse T3 (rT3) alongside a low Free T3 suggests which physiological state?",
            "options": [
                "Iodine toxicity",
                "The body is 'braking' metabolism due to stress, inflammation, or calorie restriction",
                "The thyroid gland is overproducing hormone (Hyperthyroidism)",
                "The client has a genetic inability to produce TSH"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 acts as a metabolic brake. High levels indicate that the body is diverting T4 into an inactive form (rT3) rather than the active Free T3, often due to systemic stress or illness."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the context of Saliva testing, what is the 'Free Hormone' fraction and why does it matter?",
            "options": [
                "It represents hormones that are bound to SHBG and are inactive",
                "It is the 1-5% of hormones not bound to proteins, which are bioavailable to cells",
                "It is the hormone fraction that has already been used and is ready for excretion",
                "It refers to hormones that are 'free' of charge in a clinical setting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Saliva testing measures the 'free' or unbound fraction of hormones. Because these are not attached to carrier proteins like SHBG or Albumin, they are the only hormones capable of entering cells and exerting a biological effect."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'Red Flag' symptom in a Baseline Audit that requires immediate referral to a medical professional rather than coaching intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Mild bloating after eating lentils",
                "Unexplained rapid weight loss, severe pelvic pain, or palpable lumps",
                "Irritability three days before a period",
                "Waking up once per night to use the bathroom"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As a Hormone Health Coach, recognizing 'Red Flags'—such as rapid weight loss or severe pain—is critical for scope of practice. These require clinical diagnosis to rule out serious underlying pathology."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing the 'Client Roadmap' (Lesson 8), what is the recommended first priority for intervention based on the Baseline Audit?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose hormone replacement therapy",
                "Advanced genetic testing for MTHFR mutations",
                "Foundational lifestyle 'leaks' (Sleep, Blood Sugar, Stress) identified in the B.L.O.O.M. Audit",
                "Aggressive detoxification protocols using chelating agents"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The roadmap always begins with foundational 'leaks.' Correcting circadian rhythm, blood sugar stability, and stress response provides the necessary physiological safety for more advanced hormonal interventions to be effective."
