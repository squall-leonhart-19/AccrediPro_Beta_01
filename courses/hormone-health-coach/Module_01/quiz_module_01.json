            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which specific endocrine gland is responsible for the synthesis of melatonin from serotonin, and which environmental trigger primarily regulates this process via the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)?",
            "options": [
                "The Anterior Pituitary; regulated by blood glucose levels",
                "The Pineal Gland; regulated by light exposure (photic input)",
                "The Hypothalamus; regulated by core body temperature",
                "The Adrenal Cortex; regulated by ACTH secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pineal gland converts serotonin to melatonin. This process is regulated by the SCN in the hypothalamus, which receives photic input from the retina to coordinate circadian rhythms."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Unlike peptide hormones, steroid hormones are lipophilic. What is the primary mechanism by which steroid hormones exert their effects on a target cell?",
            "options": [
                "Binding to G-protein coupled receptors on the cell membrane",
                "Activation of secondary messengers like cAMP",
                "Diffusion through the lipid bilayer to bind with intracellular or nuclear receptors",
                "Facilitated diffusion through protein channels to increase ATP production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Steroid hormones are lipid-soluble and can pass directly through the cell membrane to bind with receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus, where they act as transcription factors to influence gene expression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis, what is the 'negative feedback' response to elevated levels of circulating Free T3 and Free T4?",
            "options": [
                "Increased secretion of TRH from the hypothalamus",
                "Inhibition of both TRH from the hypothalamus and TSH from the anterior pituitary",
                "Stimulation of the thyroid gland to produce more calcitonin",
                "Increased conversion of T4 to Reverse T3 in the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Negative feedback ensures homeostasis; high levels of thyroid hormones signal the hypothalamus to decrease Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) and the pituitary to decrease Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of androgen deficiency despite 'normal' total testosterone levels. If their Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) is high, what is the likely physiological explanation?",
            "options": [
                "High SHBG increases the amount of 'free' bioavailable testosterone",
                "High SHBG binds more testosterone, reducing the amount of 'free' hormone available to tissues",
                "High SHBG indicates a failure of the pituitary gland",
                "SHBG has no effect on hormone bioavailability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG is a transport protein. When elevated, it binds more tightly to hormones like testosterone, leaving less 'free' or bioavailable hormone to interact with cellular receptors."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which phenomenon occurs when a cell is chronically exposed to high concentrations of a hormone, such as insulin, resulting in a decrease in the number of active receptors?",
            "options": [
                "Upregulation",
                "Potentiation",
                "Downregulation (Receptor Resistance)",
                "Synergistic Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Downregulation is a defense mechanism where the cell reduces its receptor density in response to chronic overstimulation, leading to the clinical pattern of hormone resistance."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to the principles of Endocrine-Immune-Neurological Cross-talk, how does chronic psychological stress (elevated cortisol) typically impact the immune system's cytokine profile?",
            "options": [
                "It permanently enhances all immune responses",
                "It shifts the balance toward a pro-inflammatory state by inducing glucocorticoid resistance in immune cells",
                "It eliminates the production of Interleukin-6 (IL-6)",
                "It has no measurable effect on immune signaling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to 'glucocorticoid receptor resistance' in immune cells, meaning cortisol can no longer effectively suppress inflammation, leading to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Homeostasis' and 'Allostasis' in endocrine physiology?",
            "options": [
                "Homeostasis refers to rapid changes, while allostasis refers to slow changes",
                "Homeostasis is the maintenance of a static set point; allostasis is achieving stability through physiological change in response to stressors",
                "Homeostasis only involves the nervous system",
                "There is no difference; the terms are synonymous"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Homeostasis maintains a narrow operating range (like blood pH), while allostasis describes the process by which the body adjusts its 'set points' to adapt to chronic challenges (allostatic load)."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "During the perimenopausal transition, which hormonal change is most frequently associated with the 'shortening' of the menstrual cycle and increased anxiety?",
            "options": [
                "A dramatic rise in Progesterone",
                "A decline in Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "A decline in Progesterone relative to Estrogen (Luteal insufficiency)",
                "The complete cessation of Estrogen production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is often characterized by anovulatory cycles or poor corpus luteum function, leading to low progesterone. This 'estrogen dominance' can cause shorter cycles and mood disturbances."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old male with chronic obesity and high stress presents with low libido. Labs show high Cortisol, high Insulin, and high Estrogen, but low LH and Low Testosterone. This pattern most likely represents:",

                "Primary Hypogonadism (testicular failure)",
                "Functional Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism due to HPA-HPG axis interference",
                "Hyperthyroidism",
                "A normal aging process requiring no intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress (HPA axis) and obesity (insulin/aromatization of testosterone to estrogen) can inhibit the hypothalamus and pituitary (low LH), resulting in secondary or functional hypogonadism."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Technical Data: Research on receptor kinetics indicates that 'spare receptors' exist. Approximately what percentage of receptors must be occupied by a hormone like insulin to achieve 100% of the maximum biological response?",
            "options": [
                "100%",
                "75-80%",
                "Less than 5-10%",
                "Exactly 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In many tissues, a maximal biological response is achieved when only a small fraction (often <10%) of the total receptors are occupied, demonstrating the extreme sensitivity and amplification of endocrine signaling."
