            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "Which physiological pathway is responsible for the 'near-instantaneous' release of epinephrine and norepinephrine during an acute stressor?",
            "options": [
                "The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis",
                "The Sympatho-Adreno-Medullary (SAM) Axis",
                "The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)",
                "The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SAM axis involves direct neural stimulation of the adrenal medulla, resulting in the immediate release of catecholamines, whereas the HPA axis is a slower hormonal cascade involving the adrenal cortex."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In modern endocrinology, 'Adrenal Fatigue' is considered a misnomer because the primary pathology usually involves:",
            "options": [
                "The structural failure of the adrenal glands to produce hormones",
                "A permanent depletion of cholesterol precursors in the body",
                "Dysregulation of the feedback loops and signaling between the brain and the adrenals",
                "Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex (Addison's Disease)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that in most cases of stress-related exhaustion, the adrenal glands remain capable of producing cortisol, but the HPA-axis signaling (the 'thermostat') is downregulated or dysregulated."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is characterized by a cortisol increase of approximately ____ above waking levels within 30-45 minutes of rising.",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "30-40%",

                "100-150%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust CAR, defined as a 50-75% increase within 30-45 minutes of waking, is a clinical marker of HPA-axis plasticity and healthy hippocampal function."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a low DHEA-to-Cortisol ratio. According to Lesson 4, this biochemical state most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Anabolic dominance and tissue repair",
                "Catabolic dominance and accelerated tissue breakdown",
                "Optimal endocrine resilience",
                "Acute SAM axis activation only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEA is anabolic and counter-regulatory to cortisol. A low ratio (low DHEA relative to cortisol) suggests the body is in a catabolic state, prioritizing survival over repair."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "What does current research suggest regarding the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (the idea that cortisol 'steals' precursors from sex hormones)?",
            "options": [
                "It is a confirmed biochemical fact occurring in the mitochondria",
                "It is a myth; the body has separate pools of pregnenolone for different pathways",
                "It is caused by a lack of dietary cholesterol intake",
                "It only occurs in men, not in women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' is largely considered a myth in contemporary biochemistry. The downregulation of sex hormones during stress is actually due to selective enzymatic regulation (downregulation of CYP17) rather than a lack of raw material."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a validated marker of 'Vagal Tone' and the body's ability to transition into a parasympathetic state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV (the variation in time between heartbeats) is the gold standard for measuring autonomic nervous system flexibility and vagus nerve activity."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A client is 'tired but wired,' experiencing high evening cortisol and difficulty falling asleep. Which adaptogen is most clinically appropriate for this presentation?",
            "options": [
                "Rhodiola rosea",
                "Panax ginseng",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is a 'calming' adaptogen that has been shown in clinical trials to reduce serum cortisol levels and improve sleep quality in stressed individuals."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Why is High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) often contraindicated for clients in the 'Exhaustion' phase of HPA-axis dysregulation?",
            "options": [
                "It causes excessive muscle hypertrophy",
                "It lowers blood pressure too significantly",
                "It imposes a massive glycemic and cortisol demand that the dysregulated HPA axis cannot meet",
                "It increases DHEA levels too rapidly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In burnout/exhaustion phases, the body lacks the resilience to handle the intense cortisol spike and subsequent recovery demand of HIIT, often leading to further 'crashing' or systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In a 2021 study on burnout recovery, what was the most significant predictor of HPA-axis normalization?",
            "options": [
                "High-protein dieting",
                "Sleep consistency and circadian alignment",
                "Intense cardiovascular exercise",
                "The use of synthetic glucocorticoids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian rhythm alignment (consistent sleep/wake times) is the primary driver for normalizing the cortisol rhythm and the Cortisol Awakening Response."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Which adaptogen is known as a 'stimulating' adaptogen, best used for 'flat' fatigue and enhancing cognitive performance under acute stress?",

                "Holy Basil",
                "Reishi Mushroom",
                "Rhodiola rosea",
                "Magnesium Glycinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola rosea is categorized as a stimulating adaptogen due to its effects on monoamines and its ability to reduce fatigue in 'flat' or 'depleted' presentations."
