            "question": "According to the 'Economics of Group Coaching' (L1), how does the scalability of a group program typically impact a coach's hourly rate compared to 1-on-1 sessions?",
            "options": [
                "It decreases the hourly rate because group fees are lower per person.",
                "It can increase the effective hourly rate by 200-400% by serving multiple clients simultaneously.",
                "It remains the same as 1-on-1 coaching due to increased administrative overhead.",
                "It only increases if the group size exceeds 50 participants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group coaching allows a coach to leverage their time. While the price per person is lower, the aggregate revenue for the hour spent coaching multiple people significantly increases the coach's effective hourly rate."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "When managing a group with 'Hormonal Sensitivity' (L3), why is it critical to establish a 'Vulnerability Contract' during the first session?",
            "options": [
                "To legally waive all liability for emotional distress.",
                "To ensure participants do not ask questions about their own health.",

                "To prevent participants from sharing personal stories."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormonal imbalances (like low progesterone or cortisol dysregulation) can increase emotional sensitivity. A vulnerability contract sets the ground rules for empathy and safety within the group dynamic."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-impact intensives for adult learners should prioritize application. A 30/70 ratio ensures that foundational knowledge is delivered but the majority of the time is spent on workshops, exercises, and integration."
