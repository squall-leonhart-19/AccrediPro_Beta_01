            "question": "A Hormone Health Coach reviews a client's DUTCH test and notices a 'flat' diurnal cortisol pattern. Which statement is legally compliant within the coaching scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "\"Your results confirm you are suffering from Stage 3 Adrenal Fatigue.\"",
                "\"I am diagnosing you with HPA-axis dysfunction based on these markers.\"",
                "\"The data shows a pattern of low cortisol production that correlates with your reported fatigue.\"",
                "\"We need to start you on Hydrocortisone to correct this adrenal insufficiency.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must use 'descriptive language' and 'pattern identification' rather than diagnostic labels. Terms like 'Adrenal Fatigue' or 'Insufficiency' are medical diagnoses or clinical terms that fall outside the coaching scope."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is a mandatory contract under HIPAA that ensures third-party service providers (like CRMs or cloud storage) adhere to the same security standards as the practitioner."

            "question": "The FTC’s 2023 'Health Products Compliance Guidance' emphasizes that health claims must be substantiated by 'competent and reliable scientific evidence.' For a coach, this means:",

            "options": [
                "Order the tests directly and interpret them as a medical provider would.",
                "Use a 'Direct-to-Consumer' (DTC) model where the client orders their own labs.",
                "Ignore state laws as long as the coach is certified by a private organization.",
                "Only work with clients who agree to keep the testing secret."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In restrictive jurisdictions, the safest legal path is the DTC model, where the client maintains ownership of the order, or working under a 'co-signature' from a licensed local physician."

                "\"Based on your labs, a higher dose is definitely indicated.\""
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormone coaches are strictly prohibited from recommending changes to prescription medications, including BHRT. This is a clear violation of the medical-coaching divide."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In most international and interstate legal frameworks, the 'service' is considered to be received at the client’s location, meaning the coach must comply with the regulations of the client's jurisdiction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Testimonials cannot make 'cure' claims that the coach themselves cannot legally make. Even with a disclaimer, the FTC views 'cure' claims for chronic diseases as high-risk and potentially deceptive."
