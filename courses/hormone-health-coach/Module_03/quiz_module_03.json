            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "In Phase 1 Estrogen Metabolism, which hydroxylation pathway is considered 'genotoxic' due to its ability to form unstable DNA adducts if not properly methylated?",
            "options": [
                "The 2-OH pathway",
                "The 4-OH pathway",
                "The 16-OH pathway",
                "The 12-OH pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4-OH pathway produces catechol estrogens that can be oxidized into quinones, which are genotoxic. The 2-OH pathway is generally considered 'protective,' and the 16-OH pathway is associated with higher proliferative activity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) occurs because the body prioritizes survival over reproduction. Which enzyme is upregulated by chronic stress to facilitate this shift?",
            "options": [
                "17,20-lyase",
                "Aromatase",
                "3β-HSD (3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)",
                "CYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chronic ACTH stimulation increases the activity of CYP11B enzymes to produce cortisol, often at the expense of the pathways leading to DHEA and sex hormones like progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' TSH (2.1 mIU/L) but clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. Their Reverse T3 (rT3) is elevated. What is the most likely cellular mechanism at play?",
            "options": [
                "Primary thyroid gland failure",
                "Upregulation of the D3 deiodinase enzyme due to systemic inflammation",
                "Iodine toxicity inhibiting T4 release",
                "Autoimmune destruction of TSH receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The D3 deiodinase enzyme converts T4 into Reverse T3 (an inactive 'brake') and T3 into T2. This is often upregulated during chronic stress, illness, or inflammation to slow metabolism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "According to the Module 3 data on Insulin Sensitivity, what HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) value is typically the threshold for identifying early-stage insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR > 1.0",
                "HOMA-IR > 1.9",
                "HOMA-IR > 3.5",
                "HOMA-IR > 5.0"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges vary, a HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates the beginning of insulin resistance, whereas scores above 2.9 indicate significant insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What is the primary role of the enzyme Beta-glucuronidase within the Estrobolome?",
            "options": [
                "It conjugates estrogen with glucuronic acid for excretion",
                "It converts Estradiol into the weaker Estriol",
                "It deconjugates estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into systemic circulation",
                "It breaks down fiber into short-chain fatty acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase 'un-glues' the estrogen from its carrier (glucuronic acid) in the gut. If levels are too high due to dysbiosis, estrogen is reabsorbed (enterohepatic recirculation) rather than excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "How does chronic hypercortisolemia specifically impact Progesterone's effectiveness at the cellular level?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the number of progesterone receptors",
                "It blocks progesterone receptors and decreases receptor sensitivity",
                "It converts all progesterone into testosterone",
                "It stimulates the ovaries to produce excess progesterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol and Progesterone have similar molecular structures. High cortisol can compete for progesterone receptor sites and downregulate receptor sensitivity, leading to 'progesterone deficiency' symptoms even if serum levels are normal."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) often exhibit a 'Non-Monotonic Dose-Response.' What does this mean for clinical practice?",
            "options": [
                "Only high doses of chemicals are dangerous to the endocrine system",
                "The dose makes the poison; higher doses always cause more damage",
                "Low-level, chronic exposure can be more disruptive than high-level acute exposure",
                "EDCs only affect the body if the liver is already compromised"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-monotonic means the response does not follow a straight line. EDCs can have significant biological effects at very low doses (parts per billion) that might not be seen at higher doses, making 'safe' thresholds difficult to define."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the BLOOM Optimization Protocol, the 'L' stands for 'Liver and Lymphatic Clearance.' Which intervention is a priority in this phase to support Phase 2 Methylation?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Increasing intake of trimethylglycine (TMG), B12, and Magnesium",
                "A 3-day water fast",
                "Supplementing with high-dose synthetic estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase 2 detoxification (specifically methylation via the COMT enzyme) requires methyl donors and cofactors like TMG, B-vitamins, and Magnesium to neutralize reactive estrogen metabolites."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client has low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Based on the insulin sensitivity lesson, what is the most likely metabolic driver?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperinsulinemia",
                "Hypocortisolism",
                "Excessive fiber intake",
                "Low testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High levels of insulin (hyperinsulinemia) suppress the liver's production of SHBG. This leads to higher levels of 'free' (active) hormones, which can exacerbate conditions like PCOS or estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which specific nutrient is essential for the function of Deiodinase enzymes (D1 and D2) to ensure the conversion of T4 to the active T3 hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Selenium",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Copper"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deiodinase enzymes are selenoproteins, meaning they require Selenium as a mandatory cofactor to strip an iodine atom from T4 to create active T3."
