            "question": "When utilizing the Comprehensive Symptom Mapping tool, how is the 'Symptom Burden Score' calculated to ensure clinical priority?",
            "options": [
                "By counting the total number of symptoms reported regardless of severity",
                "By multiplying the frequency of the symptom (1-4) by the intensity (1-4) to create a weighted impact value",
                "By prioritizing only the symptoms that the client mentions first during the intake interview",
                "By comparing the client's symptoms against a database of 10,000 previous cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To identify root causes, practitioners must weight symptoms by both how often they occur and how severely they impact the client's life, preventing 'data noise' from minor, infrequent complaints."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis, what is the recognized 'functional range' for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), as opposed to the standard laboratory 'pathological range'?",
            "options": [
                "0.45 – 4.5 mIU/L",
                "0.1 – 10.0 mIU/L",
                "1.0 – 2.5 mIU/L",
                "3.0 – 5.5 mIU/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges are tighter than lab ranges; while labs look for disease (pathology), functional medicine looks for sub-optimal performance, typically placing TSH between 1.0 and 2.5 mIU/L."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) test is superior to a single serum blood draw for assessing estrogen metabolism because it measures:",
            "options": [
                "The total amount of estrogen stored in adipose tissue",
                "The ratio of 2-OH, 4-OH, and 16-OH metabolites, indicating how the liver is processing estrogen",
                "The exact moment of ovulation with 99.9% accuracy",
                "Free testosterone levels unaffected by SHBG"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serum tests only show the level of circulating hormones, whereas dried urine (DUTCH) allows practitioners to see the phase I and phase II detoxification metabolites, which is critical for assessing estrogen dominance risks."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "When tracking Basal Body Temperature (BBT), what specific physiological event causes the 'thermal shift' of 0.5°F to 1.0°F in the second half of the cycle?",
            "options": [
                "The surge of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) just before ovulation",
                "The thermogenic effect of progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum",
                "The drop in estrogen levels following the follicular phase",
                "An increase in metabolic rate caused by the follicular stimulating hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is a thermogenic hormone. A sustained rise in BBT for at least three days confirms that ovulation has occurred and the corpus luteum is producing sufficient progesterone."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Heart Rate Variability (HRV), how does the Infradian rhythm typically affect autonomic nervous system data in cycling women?",
            "options": [
                "HRV remains constant throughout the entire 28-day cycle",
                "HRV is typically higher (indicating better recovery) in the follicular phase and lower in the luteal phase",
                "HRV is lowest during menstruation and highest during ovulation",
                "HRV can only be measured accurately in post-menopausal women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the parasympathetic nervous system is more dominant in the follicular phase (higher HRV), while the sympathetic nervous system becomes more active in the luteal phase (lower HRV) due to the metabolic demands of progesterone."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which 'Red Flag' in a client's menstrual cycle map most strongly suggests anovulation (a cycle where no egg is released)?",
            "options": [
                "A cycle length of exactly 28 days",
                "Bright red bleeding for the first two days of menstruation",
                "A 'monophasic' BBT chart showing no sustained temperature rise",
                "The presence of cervical mucus that resembles egg whites"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A monophasic chart (one that stays at roughly the same temperature throughout) indicates that no progesterone-induced thermal shift occurred, which is a hallmark of an anovulatory cycle."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "When systematizing client history using the 'ATM' framework, what does the 'T' represent?",

                "Thyroid Markers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ATM framework stands for Antecedents (pre-existing factors), Triggers (events that provoked the onset), and Mediators (factors that keep the symptoms going)."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, what is identified as the biggest challenge when using wearable data (like Oura or Whoop) for hormonal coaching?",
            "options": [
                "The devices are too expensive for most clients",
                "The lack of data points provided by the apps",
                "Distinguishing 'signal' from 'noise'—not overreacting to a single night of poor data",
                "Wearables cannot measure heart rate accurately during sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary challenge for coaches is helping clients look at 7-day and 30-day trends rather than becoming anxious over a single night's data, which can be skewed by alcohol, late meals, or stress."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client presents with low morning cortisol, high evening cortisol, and a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) on a saliva test. This pattern is most indicative of:",

                "Optimal HPA axis function",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat CAR and flipped cortisol rhythm (low morning, high night) indicates the brain is no longer properly signaling the adrenal glands to follow a healthy circadian rhythm, often seen in chronic burnout."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of a Dynamic Progress Dashboard in the AccrediPro methodology?",
            "options": [
                "To replace the need for follow-up consultations",
                "To correlate subjective symptom improvements with objective biomarker data (like BBT or HRV)",
                "To provide a document that the client can use to self-diagnose medical conditions",
                "To automate the prescription of supplements based on lab values"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A dashboard's value lies in 'connecting the dots' for the client, showing them that as their HRV or BBT stabilizes (objective), their energy and mood scores (subjective) also improve, increasing compliance."
