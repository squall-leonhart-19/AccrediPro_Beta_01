            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Functional Range' for TSH is distinguished from the 'Standard Laboratory Range.' What is the optimal functional target for TSH in a healthy, non-medicated individual?",
            "options": ["0.5 - 4.5 uIU/mL", "1.0 - 2.0 uIU/mL", "2.5 - 5.5 uIU/mL", "0.1 - 1.0 uIU/mL"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs use a broad range (up to 4.5), functional medicine identifies 1.0 - 2.0 uIU/mL as the 'sweet spot' where most patients report optimal metabolic function and energy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Language of the Endocrine System' (Lesson 2), what occurs during the process of receptor downregulation?",
            "options": ["The body produces more hormones to compensate for low sensitivity", "Cells increase the number of receptors to catch more hormones", "Cells decrease the number of receptors in response to chronically high hormone levels", "The liver increases the production of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Downregulation is a cellular defense mechanism where receptors are internalized or decreased in response to chronic overstimulation, often seen in insulin resistance or leptin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "To achieve optimal 'Estrogen-Progesterone Synergy' (Lesson 3), what is the target Progesterone-to-Estradiol (Pg/E2) ratio during the mid-luteal phase?",
            "options": ["10:1 to 50:1", "50:1 to 100:1", "100:1 to 500:1", "Over 1000:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy Pg/E2 ratio is typically between 100:1 and 500:1. Ratios below 100 often indicate 'relative estrogen dominance,' even if absolute estrogen levels are within range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In the 'Thyroid-Adrenal Crosstalk' (Lesson 4), how does chronic high cortisol specifically impact thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": ["It stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more T4", "It inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, decreasing T4 to T3 conversion and increasing Reverse T3 (rT3)", "It increases the sensitivity of T3 receptors in the mitochondria", "It lowers thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), leading to excess Free T4"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High cortisol shifts the body into a 'starvation/survival' mode, inhibiting the conversion of inactive T4 into active T3, instead shunting it toward the metabolic brake, Reverse T3."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Complex Symptom Clusters.' What is the bi-directional relationship between Estrogen and Histamine?",
            "options": ["Estrogen stabilizes mast cells and lowers histamine levels", "Histamine inhibits the production of estrogen in the ovaries", "Estrogen stimulates mast cells to release histamine, and histamine stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen", "There is no documented relationship between estrogen and histamine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This 'vicious cycle' explains why women with estrogen dominance often experience worsened allergy-like symptoms or hives during high-estrogen phases of their cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Regarding 'Weight Loss Resistance' (Lesson 6), which hormonal mechanism explains why chronic stress leads to visceral (belly) fat accumulation even in a calorie deficit?",
            "options": ["Cortisol triggers gluconeogenesis, which raises blood glucose and triggers secondary insulin spikes", "Cortisol increases the thermic effect of food", "Cortisol suppresses ghrelin, leading to decreased appetite", "Cortisol increases the conversion of white fat to brown fat"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is catabolic to muscle but anabolic to visceral fat; it raises blood sugar internally, which forces insulin to rise, signaling the body to store fat in the abdominal region."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the 'Maintain & Thrive' Framework (Lesson 7), what is the '80/20 Circadian Rule' for long-term vitality?",
            "options": ["80% of calories before 2 PM, 20% after", "80% adherence to light/dark cycles with 20% flexibility for social life", "80% cardio and 20% strength training", "80% supplements and 20% whole foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The framework emphasizes that while circadian hygiene (morning light/evening dark) is critical, 20% flexibility prevents the 'orthorexia of health' and reduces psychological stress."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Which phase of the B.L.O.O.M. Method™ (Lesson 8) involves the 'Observe' step?",
            "options": ["The initial consultation and intake", "The implementation of the first supplement protocol", "The 4-week period of tracking symptoms and cycle changes after lifestyle adjustments", "The final maintenance phase where the client is discharged"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Observe' phase is critical for data collection, allowing the coach and client to see how the 'Lifestyle' and 'Optimize' interventions are actually affecting biological rhythms before making further changes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a TSH of 3.2 uIU/mL, cold hands, and thinning hair. Her doctor said she is 'normal.' Using the Advanced Baseline Assessment (Lesson 1), how should you interpret this?",
            "options": ["The client is perfectly healthy and her symptoms are psychosomatic", "The client is in the 'Standard' range but outside the 'Functional' range, suggesting subclinical thyroid dysfunction", "The client has overt Hypothyroidism and needs immediate medication", "The TSH is too low and she is likely hyperthyroid"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A TSH of 3.2 is 'normal' by standard lab criteria (usually up to 4.5) but is well above the functional limit of 2.0, indicating the thyroid is working harder than optimal to maintain levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A client in the 'Optimize' phase of the B.L.O.O.M. Method™ reports that her PMS symptoms returned after a high-stress month. What is the most likely 'Crosstalk' mechanism (Lesson 4/5)?",
            "options": ["The 'Progesterone Steal' (Pregnenolone Steal) where the body prioritizes Cortisol over Progesterone", "The thyroid gland produced too much T3", "The client ate too much fiber, clearing out her estrogen", "The 'Insulin Flush' where insulin removes progesterone from the blood"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Under high stress, the body shunts the precursor hormone Pregnenolone toward Cortisol production to ensure survival, often at the expense of Progesterone, leading to a relative estrogen dominance and return of PMS."
