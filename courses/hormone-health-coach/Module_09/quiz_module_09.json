            "question": "In the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis, which hormone is specifically released by the anterior pituitary to stimulate the Leydig cells to produce testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)",
                "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)",
                "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LH (Luteinizing Hormone) travels through the bloodstream to the testes, where it binds to receptors on Leydig cells to initiate the conversion of cholesterol into testosterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to longitudinal studies like the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, at what average rate does total testosterone typically decline in men after the age of 30?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% per year",
                "1% per year",
                "3% per year",
                "5% per decade"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that after age 30, total testosterone levels decline by approximately 1% per year, while bioavailable (free) testosterone may decline even faster due to rising SHBG levels."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A 52-year-old client presents with symptoms of low libido and fatigue. His lab results show 'Normal' Total Testosterone (550 ng/dL) but 'Low' Free Testosterone. Which of the following factors is most likely contributing to this discrepancy?",
            "options": [
                "Low levels of Albumin",
                "High levels of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)",

                "Suppressed Luteinizing Hormone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds tightly to testosterone, making it biologically inactive. High SHBG levels can result in low 'Free' testosterone even when 'Total' testosterone appears adequate."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "The aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) is primarily responsible for which hormonal conversion in the male body?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aromatization is the process where testosterone is converted into estradiol. This occurs primarily in adipose (fat) tissue, which is why higher body fat percentages often correlate with higher estrogen in men."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Which enzyme is the primary target for pharmacological and natural interventions aimed at reducing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms by limiting the conversion of testosterone to DHT?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "5-alpha reductase converts testosterone into Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the more potent androgen responsible for prostate growth. Inhibiting this enzyme helps manage prostate volume."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Erectile function relies heavily on the release of Nitric Oxide (NO) to relax smooth muscle. Which amino acid is the direct precursor to Nitric Oxide in the vascular endothelium?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Arginine is the primary substrate used by Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) to produce Nitric Oxide, which triggers the cGMP pathway necessary for vasodilation and erectile function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Large muscle group compound movements performed at high intensity (75-85% 1RM) with moderate volume and sufficient rest periods have been shown in meta-analyses to produce the greatest acute increase in testosterone and growth hormone."
