            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how Bisphenol A (BPA) acts as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) in the human body?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) by only binding to Alpha receptors.",
                "It acts as an estrogen receptor agonist, mimicking 17β-estradiol and triggering inappropriate cellular responses.",
                "It irreversibly binds to the thyroid transport protein transthyretin, preventing T4 transport.",
                "It inhibits the production of aromatase, leading to a total loss of systemic estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is primarily known as an estrogen receptor agonist. It mimics the structure of natural estrogen (17β-estradiol), allowing it to bind to estrogen receptors and activate gene expression at inappropriate times or levels."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "During Phase II Liver Detoxification, which pathway is specifically responsible for the conjugation of estrogens and is heavily dependent on the availability of magnesium and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)?",
            "options": [
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Sulfation",
                "Methylation",
                "Glutathione Conjugation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylation is the Phase II pathway that converts the potentially DNA-damaging hydroxyestrogens (like 4-OH) into stable methoxyestrogens. This process requires the COMT enzyme, which depends on magnesium and the methyl donor SAMe."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' influences hormonal balance primarily through the production of which enzyme?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "5-alpha reductase",
                "Cytochrome P450"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by specific gut bacteria. It deconjugates estrogen (breaks the bond created during Phase II glucuronidation), allowing the hormone to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Xenoestrogens, Phthalates are most commonly associated with which physiological disruption in male reproductive health?",
            "options": [
                "Increased sperm motility due to mitochondrial activation",
                "Hyper-secretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "Reduction of testosterone production via interference with Leydig cell function",
                "Enhanced conversion of testosterone to DHT"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known 'anti-androgens.' They interfere with the Leydig cells in the testes, which are responsible for testosterone production, often leading to lower circulating testosterone levels."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "How do heavy metals like Cadmium and Lead typically disrupt the HPA-Axis?",
            "options": [
                "By permanently destroying the adrenal cortex",
                "By mimicking cortisol and binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GR), leading to receptor desensitization",
                "By increasing the half-life of ACTH in the bloodstream",
                "By blocking the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heavy metals can disrupt the HPA axis by acting as 'metallohormones.' Specifically, they can bind to and activate glucocorticoid receptors or interfere with the feedback loop, leading to chronic HPA dysregulation."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which halogen element is known to compete with Iodine for uptake in the thyroid gland due to its similar atomic radius, potentially leading to hypothyroidism?",
            "options": [
                "Chlorine",
                "Fluoride",
                "Bromine",
                "All of the above"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Bromine, and Chlorine are all halogens. Because they share similar chemical properties with Iodine, they can competitively inhibit the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), preventing the thyroid from capturing the iodine it needs to make T4 and T3."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In Phase III Detoxification, what is the primary role of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR)?",
            "options": [
                "To synthesize new cholesterol for hormone production",
                "To sense bile acid levels and regulate the transport of toxins out of the liver and into the bile",
                "To neutralize superoxide radicals in the mitochondria",
                "To trigger the release of insulin in response to toxic load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FXR is a nuclear receptor that acts as a 'bile acid sensor.' It is a master regulator of Phase III detoxification, ensuring that bile flow is maintained so that conjugated toxins can be moved out of the liver and into the intestines."

            "options": [
                "Taking high doses of Vitamin C only",
                "Strengthening the physical boundaries of the body, including the gut lining, skin, and blood-brain barrier",
                "Buying only organic produce to avoid pesticides",
                "Using plastic containers instead of glass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Barrier Support (B) in the B.L.O.O.M. Method™ emphasizes that the first line of defense against toxins is the integrity of our physical barriers (gut, skin, lungs, BBB) to prevent EDCs from entering systemic circulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research has linked high paraben exposure (common in personal care products) to markers of accelerated ovarian aging, including lower antral follicle counts and reduced levels of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calcium D-Glucarate is a potent inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase and supports the glucuronidation pathway (Phase II), helping the body effectively clear estrogens and other toxins through the UGT enzymes."
