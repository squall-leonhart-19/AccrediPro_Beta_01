            "question": "In the case of 'Lean PCOS' (Lesson 1), what percentage of lean women with PCOS are estimated to have underlying insulin resistance despite a normal BMI?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 75%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 75% of lean women with PCOS exhibit some degree of insulin resistance, complicating the 'Metabolic Knot' and requiring insulin-sensitizing strategies regardless of body weight."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 44-year-old client presents with heavy cycles, breast tenderness, and increased anxiety. Her lab work shows a Progesterone to Estradiol (Pg/E2) ratio of 45:1. Based on Lesson 2, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal hormonal balance",
                "Relative Estrogen Dominance",
                "Androgen Excess",
                "Progesterone Dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An optimal Pg/E2 ratio is typically between 100:1 and 500:1. A ratio of 45:1 indicates relative estrogen dominance, a hallmark of the perimenopausal rollercoaster."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, high levels of cortisol from HPA-axis dysregulation impact thyroid function primarily by inhibiting which enzyme?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "5'-deiodinase",
                "Aromatase",
                "HMG-CoA Reductase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, which is responsible for converting T4 into the active T3, leading to increased production of the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In Post-Hormonal Birth Control Syndrome (PHBCS), which three nutrients are most critically depleted, often leading to the 'rebound' symptoms described in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C, Iron, and Calcium",
                "Vitamin B12, Zinc, and Magnesium",
                "Vitamin D, Vitamin K2, and Boron",
                "Vitamin A, Selenium, and Iodine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oral contraceptives are known to deplete B vitamins (especially B12 and Folate), Zinc, and Magnesium, which are essential for the restoration of the HPO axis."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 describes the 'Estrogen-Immune Loop' in Endometriosis. What is the role of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in this feedback loop?",
            "options": [
                "PGE2 inhibits estrogen production to protect the uterus",
                "PGE2 stimulates the enzyme aromatase, creating a local cycle of estrogen production",
                "PGE2 reduces the activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells",
                "PGE2 stabilizes the endometrial lining during the luteal phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PGE2 is a potent stimulator of the enzyme aromatase in endometriosis lesions, which leads to local estrogen production, further fueling inflammation and lesion growth."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the 'Executive Female' case study (Lesson 6), a 'blunted' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is typically indicative of which stage of HPA-axis dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Acute Stress Response (Stage 1)",
                "Resistance Phase (Stage 2)",

                "Normal Circadian Rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A blunted CAR, where cortisol fails to rise significantly within 30-45 minutes of waking, is a clinical marker of advanced HPA-axis exhaustion or burnout."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "For a client with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) or Surgical Menopause (Lesson 7), what is the diagnostic threshold for Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) to confirm the condition?",
            "options": [
                "FSH > 10 mIU/mL on one occasion",
                "FSH > 40 mIU/mL on two occasions, at least 4 weeks apart",
                "FSH < 5 mIU/mL with high LH",
                "FSH between 15-25 mIU/mL during the follicular phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "POI is clinically confirmed by FSH levels in the menopausal range (typically >40 mIU/mL) recorded on two separate occasions at least 4 weeks apart in a woman under age 40."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When integrating the B.L.O.O.M. Method™ for a multi-pathology client (Lesson 8), why is 'Pillar 1: Balance' addressed before 'Pillar 3: Optimization'?",
            "options": [
                "Optimization is only for athletes",
                "Pillar 1 focuses on removing triggers and stabilizing the foundation to prevent 'healing crises'",
                "Pillar 3 is more expensive for the client",
                "The coach should always follow alphabetical order"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the B.L.O.O.M. Method™, Balance involves stabilizing the HPA axis and gut health. Without this foundation, advanced 'Optimization' (like aggressive detox or hormone titration) can overwhelm the client's system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's presents with a TSH of 2.1 (optimal) but continues to suffer from extreme fatigue and cold intolerance. Her rT3 is 28 ng/dL (High). What is the most likely priority intervention based on Lesson 3?",
            "options": [
                "Increase her T4 medication dosage",
                "Address HPA-axis stressors and systemic inflammation",
                "Prescribe a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program",
                "Restrict iodine intake further"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High rT3 in the presence of normal TSH suggests a 'cellular' hypothyroidism caused by stress/inflammation. The priority is addressing the HPA axis to improve T4 to T3 conversion rather than increasing T4 medication."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Executive Female' (Lesson 6), which DHEA-S finding is most common in clients experiencing 'wired but tired' symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "Extremely high DHEA-S levels",
                "Low DHEA-S relative to cortisol (Low DHEA/Cortisol ratio)",
                "DHEA-S levels that peak at midnight",
                "Elevated DHEA-S with low testosterone"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress eventually leads to 'pregnenolone steal' or shunting, resulting in low DHEA-S levels relative to cortisol, which contributes to the 'wired but tired' feeling and poor stress resilience."
