            "question": "Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) in hormone coaching is defined as the integration of which three components?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical expertise, client values, and the best available research evidence",
                "Peer-reviewed studies, social media trends, and practitioner intuition",
                "Laboratory results, pharmaceutical guidelines, and insurance requirements",
                "Historical traditions, anecdotal success, and randomized controlled trials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EBP is the 'triad' of using the best research evidence combined with clinical expertise and the unique values/circumstances of the client."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "In the hierarchy of evidence, why are Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses considered the 'Gold Standard'?",
            "options": [
                "They are the fastest studies to conduct and publish",
                "They provide the highest level of detail on individual case histories",
                "They synthesize data from multiple high-quality RCTs to increase statistical power and reduce bias",
                "They rely on expert opinions from the world's leading endocrinologists"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "By pooling data from multiple Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), meta-analyses provide a more robust estimate of effect size and generalizability than a single study."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A hormone test with a 'Specificity' of 98% means which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The test will correctly identify 98% of people who actually have the condition",
                "The test will correctly identify 98% of people who do NOT have the condition (2% false positive rate)",
                "The test is 98% more accurate than a standard blood draw",
                "98% of the population should fall within the normal reference range"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specificity refers to the 'True Negative' rate. A specificity of 98% means the test is excellent at ruling out the condition in healthy individuals, with only a 2% chance of a false positive."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroendocrinology (PNE), the placebo effect is increasingly understood as a biological process involving which mechanisms?",
            "options": [
                "Purely 'faking' symptoms to please the practitioner",
                "The activation of dopaminergic and endogenous opioid pathways that can modulate the HPA axis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows the placebo effect triggers real biochemical changes, including the release of neurotransmitters and endorphins that can influence endocrine function."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "When evaluating a study on Ashwagandha for cortisol regulation, why is 'standardization' of the extract critical?",
            "options": [
                "It ensures the supplement is organic and non-GMO",
                "It guarantees that every capsule contains a consistent level of bioactive compounds, such as withanolides",
                "It makes the supplement easier for the client to digest",
                "It allows the manufacturer to charge a higher premium for the product"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without standardization, the concentration of active ingredients can vary wildly between batches, making the research results impossible to replicate in clinical practice."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A biohacking 'N-of-1' trial is most useful for which of the following purposes?",

                "Replacing the need for large-scale Randomized Controlled Trials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "N-of-1 trials are personalized experiments. While they offer high internal validity for that specific individual, they lack 'external validity' (the ability to apply results to others)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "If a study reports a 'Relative Risk' reduction of 50%, but the 'Absolute Risk' drops from 2% to 1%, how should a coach explain this to a client?",
            "options": [
                "The intervention is 50% guaranteed to cure the condition",
                "The intervention reduces the risk by half, but the actual chance of the event occurring is only reduced by 1 in 100",
                "The intervention is not statistically significant because the absolute risk is low",
                "The client should ignore the absolute risk and focus on the 50% improvement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Relative risk often sounds more dramatic than absolute risk. It is ethically important to explain both so the client understands the actual magnitude of the benefit."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "According to the Scope of Practice for Hormone Health Coaches, which of the following is an ethical violation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches cannot diagnose medical conditions or 'prescribe' treatments. They provide education and lifestyle support, referring to medical professionals for diagnosis."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "What does a 'p-value' of < 0.05 typically indicate in a clinical trial?",
            "options": [
                "There is a 5% chance the results are actually meaningful",
                "The results are 95% likely to be clinically life-changing for the client",
                "There is less than a 5% probability that the observed results occurred by random chance",
                "The study was conducted on at least 500 participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of less than 0.05 is the standard threshold for statistical significance, suggesting the intervention likely caused the effect rather than coincidence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Why might a Hormone Coach use 'Functional' blood chemistry ranges instead of standard 'Pathological' laboratory ranges?",
            "options": [
                "Pathological ranges are only designed to identify the presence of disease, whereas functional ranges aim to identify sub-optimal health",
                "Functional ranges are wider and easier for clients to achieve",
                "Standard laboratory ranges are scientifically inaccurate and outdated",
                "Functional ranges are required by law for all health coaching consultations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Standard lab ranges are often based on the average of the population visiting that lab (who are often sick). Functional ranges look for the 'sweet spot' associated with optimal physiological function."
