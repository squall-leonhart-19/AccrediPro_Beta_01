            "question": "According to the AccrediPro 'Order of Operations' framework, why must gut health and liver detoxification be prioritized before direct hormone supplementation?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client loses weight before starting hormones",
                "To prevent the recirculation of deconjugated hormones and ensure efficient metabolite clearance",
                "Because nutraceuticals are only absorbed in the large intestine",
                "To increase the production of SHBG by 40% immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before adding hormones or precursors, the body's clearance pathways (liver and gut) must be functional to prevent 'estrogen dominance' caused by the recirculation of metabolites via the enterohepatic circulation."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Phase-Based Intervention,' which nutritional adjustment is most evidence-based for a client in the mid-luteal phase experiencing progesterone insufficiency?",
            "options": [
                "Strict ketogenic dieting with <20g net carbs",
                "Increasing complex carbohydrate intake and magnesium-rich foods to support GABA and serotonin",
                "Prolonged 24-hour fasting to increase growth hormone",
                "Eliminating all fats to reduce caloric load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The luteal phase requires higher caloric intake and complex carbohydrates to facilitate the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin, which often dip alongside progesterone."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When designing a 'Therapeutic Nutraceutical' protocol for Vitex agnus-castus (Chasteberry), what is the clinically recommended cycling strategy for a cycling female?",
            "options": [
                "Continuous use for 365 days without breaks",
                "Use only during the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle",
                "Taken daily for 25 days with a 5-day break during menses to prevent receptor downregulation",
                "Taken only on alternating days to maximize absorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cycling Vitex (typically 25 days on, 5 days off) helps prevent receptor desensitization and mimics the natural rhythm of the menstrual cycle."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 2.4. Based on Module 21's metabolic flexibility guidelines, what is the primary intervention goal?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate referral for bariatric surgery",
                "Restoring insulin sensitivity through timed carbohydrate refeeds and resistance training",
                "Increasing sugar intake to 'spike' the metabolism",
                "Reducing sleep to 5 hours to increase cortisol-driven energy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR > 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance. The protocol should focus on restoring sensitivity through lifestyle, movement, and strategic macronutrient timing."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which 'Lifestyle Engineering' factor has been shown in studies to disrupt the LH surge and suppress ovulation when misaligned?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian biology is deeply linked to the HPO axis; chronic blue light exposure suppresses melatonin and can disrupt the pulsatile release of GnRH and LH."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In the 'Monitoring and Titration' phase, what is the standard recommended window for re-testing serum thyroid markers (TSH, fT3, fT4) after a protocol change?",
            "options": [
                "48 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the half-life of thyroid hormones and the time required for cellular signaling to stabilize, 6-8 weeks is the clinical standard for re-evaluation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, the HPA axis often compensates for fluctuating ovarian output. Stabilizing the stress response first prevents 'cortisol steal' and worsening of vasomotor symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "What is the primary objective of the 'Maintain & Thrive' phase (L8)?",
            "options": [
                "To keep the client on the most restrictive version of the protocol forever",
                "To transition the client to a sustainable, minimally invasive lifestyle that prevents relapse",
                "To increase the number of supplements the client takes monthly",
                "To eliminate the need for any future blood testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of maintenance is long-term resilience and the '80/20' balance, ensuring the client can maintain health without obsessive restriction."

            "options": [
                "EDCs have no measurable effect on human health",
                "Phthalate exposure is linked to a 20-30% reduction in female fecundity in certain longitudinal studies",
                "Only 1% of the population is exposed to EDCs",
                "EDCs only affect the thyroid, not the ovaries"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Module 21 emphasizes that EDCs like phthalates and BPA have significant, measurable impacts on reproductive health and fertility rates."

                "Double the dose of all supplements immediately",
                "Tell the client to ignore it and continue the protocol",
                "Temporarily reduce the dosage to the last tolerated level and assess clearance pathways",
                "Discharge the client immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration requires flexibility. If a flare occurs, 'backing off' to the last tolerated dose allows the body to catch up and suggests that detoxification pathways may be overwhelmed."
