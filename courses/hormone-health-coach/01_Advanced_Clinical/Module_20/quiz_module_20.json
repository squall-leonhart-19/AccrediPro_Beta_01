        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "In the B.L.O.O.M. Baseline framework, which component focuses on identifying the 'Biological' markers such as recent lab work and physical symptoms?",
            "options": ["Biology", "Baselines", "Biometry", "Body Composition"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'B' in B.L.O.O.M. stands for Biology, which encompasses the client's physiological data, including clinical labs, cycle history, and current physical symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis (FBCA) differs from standard clinical interpretation by using 'Optimal' ranges. What is the generally accepted functional optimal range for TSH?",
            "options": ["0.4 – 4.5 mIU/L", "0.5 – 2.0 mIU/L", "1.0 – 3.5 mIU/L", "0.1 – 5.5 mIU/L"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While standard labs use a broad range (up to 4.5 or higher), functional medicine considers 0.5 to 2.0 mIU/L as the optimal range for most healthy adults to ensure thyroid efficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A DUTCH test reveals a client has high levels of 2-Hydroxyestrone (2-OH) but very low levels of 2-Methoxyestrone. Which enzyme's function should the coach investigate further?",
            "options": ["CYP1A1", "CYP1B1", "COMT", "Beta-glucuronidase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) enzyme is responsible for the methylation of hydroxyestrogens into methoxyestrogens. Low methoxy levels relative to hydroxy levels suggest sluggish methylation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which specific microbiome marker, when elevated on a GI-MAP or similar stool test, indicates that estrogen is being deconjugated and reabsorbed into the bloodstream?",
            "options": ["Calprotectin", "Secretory IgA", "Steatocrit", "Beta-glucuronidase"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the estrogen to be reabsorbed (enterohepatic recirculation) rather than excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "To confirm that ovulation has occurred using Basal Body Temperature (BBT) charting, what is the required temperature shift observed in the 'Rule of Three'?",
            "options": ["A rise of at least 0.1°F for 3 consecutive days", "A rise of at least 0.2°F above the previous 6 days, sustained for 3 days", "A rise of 0.5°F for 24 hours", "A decrease of 0.3°F followed by an immediate spike"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard thermal shift requirement is a rise of at least 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (or 0.1 Celsius) above the previous six days' temperatures, sustained for at least three consecutive days."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When analyzing Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data, what does a high 'Glycemic Variability' (GV) most likely indicate regarding hormonal health?",
            "options": ["Optimal insulin sensitivity", "High progesterone production", "Increased oxidative stress and HPA axis dysregulation", "Low cortisol levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High glycemic variability (frequent 'spikes and crashes') is a significant stressor on the body, triggering cortisol release and increasing oxidative stress, which can disrupt the delicate balance of sex hormones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'dirty' 4-OH pathway on her DUTCH test, which is associated with DNA damage. Which nutrient is a critical cofactor for the COMT enzyme to help neutralize these metabolites?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Magnesium", "Zinc", "Vitamin A"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is a mandatory cofactor for the COMT enzyme. Without sufficient magnesium, the methylation of the potentially toxic 4-OH metabolites is significantly impaired."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "According to the module, a Ferritin level below which threshold may impair the conversion of T4 to T3, even if the client's TSH is within 'normal' lab limits?",
            "options": ["10 ng/mL", "30 ng/mL", "70 ng/mL", "100 ng/mL"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional practitioners often look for Ferritin levels of at least 30-40 ng/mL (and ideally 50-80 ng/mL) for optimal thyroid hormone production and cellular utilization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "During Data Triangulation, you notice a client has low Heart Rate Variability (HRV), high fasting glucose, and a shortened luteal phase. What is the most likely root cause synthesis?",
            "options": ["Excessive estrogen consumption", "Chronic sympathetic nervous system dominance (stress)", "Primary ovarian failure", "Nutritional iodine deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV (low recovery), high glucose (cortisol-induced gluconeogenesis), and a short luteal phase (progesterone 'steal' or suppression) collectively point to chronic stress/HPA axis activation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers specifically to which of the following?",
            "options": ["The collection of estrogen-producing glands in the body", "The set of genes responsible for estrogen receptor sensitivity", "The collection of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing and sequestering estrogens", "The pathway of estrogen breakdown in the liver"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is a subset of the gut microbiome containing bacteria with the specific enzymes (like beta-glucuronidase) required to metabolize and regulate the body's circulating estrogen."
