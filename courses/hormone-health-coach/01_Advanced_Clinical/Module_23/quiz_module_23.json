                "Increased methylation accelerates protein synthesis",
                "Decreased methylation leads to permanent gene deletion",
                "Methylation has no effect on gene expression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base, typically acts to repress gene transcription, effectively silencing that portion of the DNA."
