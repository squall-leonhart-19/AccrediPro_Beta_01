            "question": "According to the 'Niche Authority' framework in Lesson 1, why is a specialized niche like 'Post-Pill PCOS Management' more profitable than 'General Hormone Coaching'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for higher pricing due to perceived expert status and lower marketing costs through targeted SEO.",
                "It requires less continuing education because the scope of knowledge is narrower.",
                "Generalist coaching is legally restricted in most jurisdictions, whereas niches are not.",
                "Specialized niches allow the coach to prescribe specific medications for that condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates 'Category Authority.' When you solve a specific, painful problem for a specific group, your marketing becomes more efficient and your perceived value increases, allowing for premium pricing."

            "question": "A Hormone Health Coach provides a client with a detailed supplement protocol but fails to include a medical disclaimer. Which type of insurance coverage is specifically designed to protect the coach if the client claims the advice caused harm?",

                "Product Liability Insurance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional Liability (E&O) insurance covers claims arising from the professional advice or services provided, such as a client alleging that your hormone coaching protocol caused an adverse reaction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-ticket coaching is based on the value of the outcome (e.g., resolving infertility or chronic fatigue) rather than the number of hours spent coaching. This is known as Value-Based Pricing."

            "options": [
                "Scientific citations and abstract summaries",
                "Personal lifestyle photos and 'Day in the Life' posts",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social proof, specifically detailed case studies that show tangible results, provides the 'bridge of belief' necessary for a prospect to invest in a high-ticket program."

            "options": [
                "The coach should talk 80% of the time to demonstrate expertise.",
                "The coach should listen 80% of the time and the prospect should talk 80% of the time.",
                "80% of the call should be about pricing and 20% about symptoms.",
                "The coach should listen 80% of the time to identify the prospect's 'pain points' and goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Effective discovery calls are diagnostic. By listening 80% of the time, the coach gathers the necessary data to mirror the client's language and demonstrate how the program solves their specific problems."

            "id": "q14_6",

                "It eliminates the need for the coach to ever speak to the client.",
                "It reduces 'Buyer's Remorse' by providing immediate value and clear next steps.",
                "It allows the coach to upsell the client on more expensive supplements immediately.",
                "It fulfills the legal requirement for HIPAA compliance automatically."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Buyer's remorse often sets in immediately after a high-ticket purchase. An automated sequence that delivers a 'Success Guide' or 'First Steps' video validates the client's decision and reduces anxiety."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The primary challenge in scaling hormone coaching is maintaining the efficacy of the protocols when individual bio-individuality is less focused on than in 1-on-1 settings."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doctors are often time-poor and cannot provide the intensive lifestyle support patients need. Positioning yourself as a 'compliance partner' adds value to the doctor's practice and their patient outcomes."

                "Interpret the labs as a diagnosis and suggest an over-the-counter alternative."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches educate; they do not prescribe or diagnose. You can explain what 'low progesterone' typically implies but must defer dosage and medical treatment to a licensed medical professional."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "If a prospect on a discovery call says, 'I can't afford this right now,' what is the most effective 'Objection Handling' strategy discussed in Lesson 5?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This question separates the 'financial objection' from the 'belief objection.' If they say yes, you can then discuss payment plans. If they say no, the issue is trust or perceived value, not money."
