            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which lipid-based molecule serves as the essential structural precursor for the synthesis of all steroid hormones, including cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "Triacylglycerols",
                "Cholesterol",
                "Phosphatidylcholine",
                "Alpha-linolenic acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cholesterol is the primary substrate for steroidogenesis. It is converted into pregnenolone (the 'mother hormone') within the mitochondria before branching into various steroid pathways."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the context of peptide hormone synthesis, which amino acid is the direct precursor for both Thyroid hormones (T4/T3) and catecholamines (Dopamine/Adrenaline)?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tryptophan",
                "L-Arginine",
                "L-Tyrosine",
                "L-Glutamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-Tyrosine is critical for endocrine function as it combines with iodine to form thyroid hormones and serves as the starting point for the synthesis of catecholamines in the adrenal medulla."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3 highlighted that Magnesium deficiency is strongly correlated with which hormonal condition?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperthyroidism",
                "Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes",
                "Acute Adrenal Insufficiency",
                "Primary Hyperparathyroidism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium acts as a cofactor for over 300 enzymatic reactions, specifically those involving glucose metabolism and insulin receptor sensitivity. Deficiency is a known driver of insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "How does adequate dietary fiber intake (specifically insoluble and lignans) prevent 'estrogen dominance' in the enterohepatic circulation?",
            "options": [
                "By stimulating the production of beta-glucuronidase",
                "By increasing the absorption of bile salts",
                "By binding to deconjugated estrogens and promoting fecal excretion",
                "By inhibiting the aromatase enzyme in adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fiber binds to estrogens that have been processed by the liver and excreted into the bile, preventing them from being reabsorbed in the gut and ensuring they are eliminated from the body."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the principles of Chrono-nutrition, why is 'Early Time-Restricted Feeding' (eTRF) generally superior for insulin sensitivity compared to late-night eating?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin sensitivity naturally peaks in the morning to align with the cortisol awakening response",
                "Melatonin secretion at night increases insulin sensitivity",
                "Growth hormone is only secreted during fasted exercise",
                "The liver stops processing glucose after 6:00 PM regardless of intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Human metabolism is circadian-regulated; insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are higher in the morning. Eating late at night when melatonin is rising can impair glucose tolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In a clinical case study of a client with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, why might a long-term, very low-carbohydrate Ketogenic diet be counterproductive?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the conversion of T4 to T3",
                "It can lead to a physiological down-regulation of T3 levels to conserve energy",
                "Ketones inhibit the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland",
                "It causes an overproduction of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin is required for the peripheral conversion of T4 into the active T3. Chronic carbohydrate restriction can lead to lower active T3 levels, potentially slowing metabolism in sensitive individuals."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which mechanism explains how food sensitivities (IgG-mediated) contribute to 'Endocrine Inflammation'?",
            "options": [
                "They cause immediate anaphylactic shock which resets the HPA axis",
                "They increase intestinal permeability (leaky gut), allowing LPS to trigger systemic TLR4 activation",
                "They directly bind to the estrogen receptor alpha",
                "They prevent the liver from synthesizing SHBG"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food sensitivities trigger low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal permeability. This allows Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream, which activates the immune system and disrupts hormonal signaling via the HPA axis."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When personalizing supplementation for Vitamin D, what is the 'optimal' functional range for serum 25(OH)D to support steroid hormone balance?",
            "options": [
                "10–20 ng/mL",
                "20–30 ng/mL",
                "50–80 ng/mL",
                "Over 150 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges often start at 30 ng/mL, functional medicine and hormone experts target 50–80 ng/mL for optimal endocrine signaling and immune modulation."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (34) presents with heavy menses, PMS, and cyclical acne. Her fiber intake is 12g/day. Based on Module 11, what is the first nutritional priority?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate prescription of synthetic progesterone",
                "Increasing fiber to 35-50g/day to support estrogen excretion",
                "Eliminating all fats from the diet to lower cholesterol",
                "Starting a 24-hour fast every other day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms suggest estrogen dominance. Increasing fiber is a foundational 'Nutritional Precision' step to ensure the 2-hydroxy and 16-hydroxy estrogens are properly excreted rather than recirculated."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended therapeutic ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids discussed in Lesson 1 to minimize hormonal inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "20:1",
                "Between 1:1 and 4:1",
                "50:1",
                "Omega-6 should be 0:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The standard Western diet is often 15:1 or 20:1. For hormonal health and to reduce pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGE2), a ratio of 1:1 to 4:1 is considered ideal."
