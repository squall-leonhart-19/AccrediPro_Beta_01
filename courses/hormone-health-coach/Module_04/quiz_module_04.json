            "question": "The 'estrobolome' refers to a specific collection of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing and circulating estrogen. What is the primary enzyme produced by these bacteria that can lead to estrogen dominance?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Diamine Oxidase (DAO)",
                "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that unbinds conjugated estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted, which can contribute to estrogen dominance."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In Phase II Liver Detoxification, which pathway is considered the most critical for the neutralization of estrogen metabolites, specifically hydroxyestrogens?",

                "Acetylation",
                "Sulfation",
                "Methylation",
                "Glucuronidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylation, supported by the COMT enzyme and nutrients like magnesium and SAMe, is the primary pathway for converting potentially carcinogenic 2-OH and 4-OH estrogens into stable, water-soluble methoxyestrogens."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Chronic systemic inflammation disrupts hormonal signaling primarily through which mechanism involving the HPA axis?",
            "options": [
                "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha induce glucocorticoid receptor resistance.",
                "Inflammation increases the conversion of T4 to T3.",
                "Chronic inflammation stimulates the production of SHBG, lowering free hormones.",
                "Cytokines directly stimulate the ovaries to produce excess progesterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammation triggers the release of cytokines that can cause glucocorticoid receptor resistance, effectively 'blunting' the HPA axis response and requiring higher levels of cortisol to achieve the same anti-inflammatory effect."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in the course suggests that exposure to phthalates (common EDCs) is associated with a significant decrease in which hormone in men?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known anti-androgens that interfere with Leydig cell function, leading to reduced testosterone production and impaired reproductive health."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "There is a 'vicious cycle' between estrogen and histamine. Which of the following correctly describes this physiological relationship?",
            "options": [
                "High histamine levels increase the activity of the DAO enzyme.",
                "Estrogen stimulates mast cells to release histamine, and histamine stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen.",
                "Progesterone increases histamine release, while estrogen stabilizes mast cells.",
                "Histamine blocks estrogen receptors, leading to functional estrogen deficiency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen can trigger mast cell degranulation (releasing histamine) and downregulate the DAO enzyme, while histamine can stimulate the LH-mediated production of estrogen in the ovaries, creating a self-perpetuating loop."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "According to the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study (Felitti et al.), individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher are how much more likely to suffer from autoimmune diseases compared to those with a score of 0?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that an ACE score of 4 or higher is associated with a 70% to 100% increased risk of being hospitalized with a diagnosed autoimmune disease due to the long-term impact of toxic stress on immune regulation."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "The concept of 'molecular mimicry' in latent infections explains why certain pathogens can trigger autoimmune thyroiditis. Which pathogen is most commonly linked to Hashimoto’s via this mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Yersinia enterocolitica has proteins that closely resemble the TSH receptor, leading the immune system to mistakenly attack the thyroid gland after an infection."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the 'Intervention Roadmap' for hormone health, why is 'Clearing the Path' (Gut and Liver) prioritized before 'Supporting the Glands' (Adrenals/Thyroid)?",
            "options": [
                "Because hormones are produced in the gut and liver.",
                "To ensure that metabolic waste and recycled hormones are being excreted so that glandular support doesn't exacerbate toxicity.",
                "Because liver support is the only way to increase cortisol levels.",
                "To prevent the 'Pregnenolone Steal' from occurring in the gut."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If the gut and liver are compromised, any hormonal support provided may lead to a buildup of metabolites or 'recycled' hormones, potentially worsening symptoms of dominance or toxicity."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Which ratio of estrogen metabolites is traditionally used in functional medicine to assess the risk of estrogen-sensitive cancers?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 2-OH to 16-alpha-OH ratio is used to assess health; 2-OH is considered 'protective' or 'weak,' while 16-alpha-OH is highly proliferative. A higher ratio generally indicates better estrogen metabolism."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog,' itchy skin during ovulation, and severe PMS. Her Dutch Test shows high 16-OH estrogen and low methylation activity. What is the most likely primary root cause to investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "Thyroid peroxidase antibodies",
                "Histamine intolerance driven by impaired estrogen clearance",
                "Adrenal insufficiency (Stage 3)",
                "Low dietary protein intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The symptoms (itchy skin during ovulation, PMS) combined with the data (high 16-OH, low methylation) strongly suggest that poor estrogen clearance is driving a histamine flare-up, which must be addressed via the liver and gut."
