            "question": "According to the science of interoception, which area of the brain acts as the primary 'relay station' for processing internal bodily signals and translating them into subjective feelings?",
            "options": [
                "The Insular Cortex",
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Occipital Lobe",
                "The Cerebellum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The insular cortex is the primary brain region responsible for interoception, integrating physiological signals (heart rate, hunger, hormonal shifts) into a conscious sense of the body's internal state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In 2015, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) officially recommended that the menstrual cycle be treated as the '5th Vital Sign.' What is the primary clinical reason for this classification?",
            "options": [
                "To simplify birth control prescriptions",
                "Because cycle irregularities often precede the diagnosis of chronic conditions like CVD or Type 2 Diabetes",
                "Because the menstrual cycle is the only way to track thyroid function",
                "To reduce the number of physical exams required annually"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACOG and the AAP emphasize that the menstrual cycle reflects overall health; disruptions often serve as early warning signs for endocrine, metabolic, or cardiovascular issues."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When tracking Basal Body Temperature (BBT), what physiological mechanism causes the 'thermal shift' observed after ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "A surge in Luteinizing Hormone (LH)",
                "The thermogenic effect of Progesterone acting on the hypothalamus",
                "An increase in Estrogen levels during the follicular phase",
                "A decrease in Cortisol levels during sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum after ovulation, has a thermogenic effect that raises the resting body temperature by approximately 0.5°F to 1.0°F."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Spinnbarkeit' cervical mucus (clear, stretchy, like raw egg white). Which hormonal state does this most likely represent?",
            "options": [
                "Low Estrogen and high Progesterone (Luteal Phase)",
                "High Estrogen levels approaching the LH surge (Peak Fertility)",
                "The onset of menses",
                "A state of chronic Cortisol elevation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of Estrogen stimulate the cervix to produce thin, stretchy, alkaline mucus designed to facilitate sperm transport, marking the peak fertile window."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is a critical marker of circadian health. What is considered a healthy physiological increase in cortisol within 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "15-20%",
                "35-60%",
                "Over 200%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-60% increase in cortisol levels shortly after waking, which prepares the body for the day's demands and regulates the circadian clock."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Metabolic Listening), research showed that just one night of sleep deprivation (4 hours) can significantly alter hunger hormones. What is the typical result?",
            "options": [
                "Ghrelin increases by ~28% and Leptin decreases by ~18%",
                "Ghrelin decreases and Leptin increases",
                "Both Ghrelin and Leptin decrease to conserve energy",
                "Insulin sensitivity increases to compensate for fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation disrupts metabolic signaling, leading to an increase in the hunger hormone (Ghrelin) and a decrease in the satiety hormone (Leptin), often resulting in hedonic food cravings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A client reports significant 'brain fog' and anxiety during the late luteal phase. Mechanistically, this is often linked to the interaction between which hormone metabolite and neurotransmitter receptor?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol and Melatonin receptors",
                "Allopregnanolone (from Progesterone) and GABA-A receptors",
                "Estradiol and Insulin receptors",
                "Thyroxine and Dopamine receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the luteal phase, the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone modulates GABA-A receptors. Rapid fluctuations can lead to mood instability and cognitive changes in sensitive individuals."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered a 'Secondary Sign' of the menstrual cycle that can help a coach triangulate the fertile window?",
            "options": [
                "Basal Body Temperature",
                "Cervical Mucus",
                "Mittelschmerz (ovulatory pain)",
                "The start date of the period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While BBT and mucus are primary signs, Mittelschmerz (one-sided pelvic pain during ovulation) is a secondary sign that provides additional qualitative data for tracking."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "To confirm ovulation using the '3-over-6' rule in BBT tracking, what must occur?",
            "options": [
                "Three temperatures must be lower than the previous six",
                "Three consecutive temperatures must be at least 0.2°F higher than the previous six",
                "The temperature must stay exactly the same for three days",
                "The temperature must drop for three days after the peak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The '3-over-6' rule requires three consecutive daily temperatures to be higher than the previous six, confirming that the thermal shift (and thus ovulation) has occurred."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing data in an Integrated Body Journal, a 'Hormonal Gap' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The time between the end of the period and ovulation",
                "The difference between a client's chronological age and biological age",
                "A discrepancy between quantitative data (e.g., a normal lab test) and qualitative experience (e.g., the client feeling exhausted)",
                "The 24-hour window where hormone levels are at their lowest"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Hormonal Gap' occurs when clinical markers appear 'normal' but the client's biofeedback (mood, energy, sleep) indicates dysfunction, requiring a deeper look at subclinical imbalances."
