            "question": "In the SIGNAL Method™ framework, what does the 'I' represent, and why is it considered a primary driver of endocrine disruption?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin; because it regulates glucose metabolism exclusively.",
                "Inflammation; because chronic low-grade inflammation disrupts hormone receptor sensitivity and signaling.",
                "Integumentary; because skin health reflects hormonal balance.",
                "Integration; because it represents the merging of different clinical protocols."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammation is a cornerstone of the SIGNAL Method™ because systemic inflammation can interfere with hormone receptor sites (e.g., insulin resistance or leptin resistance) and the HPA axis."

            "options": [
                "Matching a specific supplement to a specific symptom (e.g., Vitex for PMS).",
                "Identifying the single hormone that is 'out of balance' and focusing solely on it.",
                "Analyzing how dysregulation in one system, such as the Gut, creates a cascade effect on the Adrenals and Thyroid.",
                "Ignoring symptoms entirely to focus only on laboratory blood markers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systems thinking views the body as an interconnected web where one system's dysfunction (like gut dysbiosis) inevitably impacts others (like thyroid conversion or adrenal output)."

            "options": [
                "Provide a formal diagnosis of PCOS so the client can begin the protocol.",
                "Tell the client, 'You have PCOS,' but clarify you are not a doctor.",
                "State, 'Your symptoms and data are consistent with PCOS; please consult your physician for a formal diagnosis while we work on foundational support.'",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormone Health Coaches do not diagnose or treat disease. They identify patterns and support the body's foundations while referring to licensed medical professionals for diagnosis."

            "question": "In Motivational Interviewing (Lesson 4), the 'Righting Reflex' refers to which common practitioner mistake?",
            "options": [
                "The urge to correct a client's behavior or provide immediate solutions rather than listening.",
                "The ability to correctly identify a hormone imbalance during the first session.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the natural desire to 'fix' a client's problems, which often triggers resistance rather than the desired behavior change."

            "options": [
                "Because it takes 90 days for insurance companies to approve health coaching.",
                "To account for the full cycle of follicular development and the lifespan of a red blood cell (HbA1c).",
                "To ensure the practitioner has enough time to sell more supplement packages.",
                "Because the SIGNAL Method™ requires 90 days of data before any changes can be made."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 90-day baseline captures a full cycle of physiological change, including the maturation of ovarian follicles and the average turnover of red blood cells, providing a stable data set."

            "question": "Lesson 6 highlights the difference between 'Normal' and 'Optimal' lab ranges. A 'Normal' TSH range might be 0.5–4.5 mIU/L, but what is typically considered 'Optimal' in the SIGNAL Method™?",
            "options": [
                "0.1–1.0 mIU/L",

                "The 'Normal' range is always the 'Optimal' range."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional/Optimal ranges are narrower than clinical lab ranges, which are based on a population average that includes sick individuals. For TSH, 1.0–2.0 mIU/L is often the target for peak thyroid function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Hierarchy of Intervention dictates that foundational lifestyle factors must be stabilized first, as they provide the environment in which hormones function."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients with HPA-axis dysregulation (high cortisol/low progesterone), stabilizing the 'S' (Stress) and 'A' (Adrenals) via circadian rhythm and nervous system support is the priority."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sudden, unexplained weight loss is a clinical 'red flag' that may indicate serious underlying pathology (e.g., hyperthyroidism, malignancy, or Type 1 Diabetes) and requires immediate medical evaluation."
