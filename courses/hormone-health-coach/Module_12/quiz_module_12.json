            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Estrogen plays a critical role in bone health by maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption. How does estrogen affect osteoclast activity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is bone-protective because it limits the lifespan of osteoclasts (cells that break down bone) by inducing apoptosis."
