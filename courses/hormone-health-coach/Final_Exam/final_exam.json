        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "According to the SIGNAL Method™, what is the primary objective of the 'S' (Survey & Systematize) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To prescribe specific botanical supplements based on initial symptoms.",
                "To establish a clinical baseline using a combination of biomarkers, symptoms, and lifestyle data.",
                "To detoxify the liver before addressing hormonal imbalances.",
                "To align the client's sleep schedule with the lunar cycle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' phase focuses on objective data collection to move away from guesswork, ensuring the coach has a clear baseline of symptoms and biomarkers before intervention."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "In the 'I' (Identify Root Dysfunctions) phase, a coach notices a client has high Reverse T3 (RT3). Which underlying physiological state is most likely contributing to this 'Identify' finding?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive iodine intake.",
                "Systemic inflammation or high cortisol levels inhibiting 5'-deiodinase activity.",
                "A deficiency in Vitamin D3.",
                "High levels of bioavailable testosterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RT3 acts as a metabolic 'brake.' High levels often indicate the body is diverting T4 away from active T3 due to stress, inflammation, or chronic illness, representing a root dysfunction in the HPT axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During Module 1, we discussed steroidogenesis. What is the fundamental precursor molecule required for the synthesis of all steroid hormones, including cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "Glucose",
                "Amino Acids",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cholesterol is the 'mother' molecule for all steroid hormones. Without adequate healthy fats and endogenous cholesterol production, the endocrine system lacks the raw materials for hormone synthesis."

                "Anywhere under 125 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 99 mg/dL is often the clinical cutoff for 'normal,' the SIGNAL Method™ targets an optimal range of 75-90 mg/dL to ensure peak insulin sensitivity and hormonal stability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Infradian rhythm is the biological clock that governs the menstrual cycle, affecting metabolism, brain chemistry, and immune function over approximately 28-32 days."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Estrobolome is a subset of the gut microbiome. Dysbiosis here leads to the recirculation of estrogen, a key root dysfunction (I) in estrogen dominance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CAR should show a 35-60% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A flat response indicates HPA-axis exhaustion or significant circadian misalignment."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "Under 'Nutritional Precision' (N), why is adequate protein intake (1.2–1.6g/kg) vital for thyroid health?",
            "options": [
                "Protein provides the iodine needed for T4.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) are synthesized from the amino acid L-tyrosine and iodine. Insufficient protein can limit the substrate available for hormone production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone, making it unavailable to tissues. High SHBG results in lower 'Free' testosterone, even if 'Total' testosterone appears normal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue and full-spectrum light through the retina signals the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) to stop melatonin and start the circadian clock, crucial for sleep-wake cycles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intestinal permeability allows undigested proteins into the bloodstream, which can trigger an immune response that mistakenly targets thyroid tissue (molecular mimicry)."
