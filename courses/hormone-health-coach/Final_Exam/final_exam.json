            "question": "According to The B.L.O.O.M. Method™, which step involves evaluating a client's current hormone levels, symptoms, and life stage through comprehensive intake forms?",
            "options": [
                "L: Listen to Your Body",
                "B: Baseline Assessment",
                "O: Optimize Hormones",
                "M: Maintain & Thrive"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'B' in BLOOM stands for Baseline Assessment, which is the foundational step where the practitioner evaluates hormones, symptoms, and the client's specific life stage to establish a starting point."

        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "In the context of the Metabolic-Hormone Connection (Module 7), how does chronic hyperinsulinemia typically affect Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly increases SHBG, leading to low free testosterone.",
                "It has no measurable effect on SHBG levels.",
                "It decreases SHBG production in the liver, increasing the bioavailability of androgens.",
                "It converts SHBG into cortisol via the HPA axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels suppress the hepatic production of SHBG. Lower SHBG results in higher levels of free (unbound) testosterone, which is a primary driver of symptoms in conditions like PCOS."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "During the 'L: Listen to Your Body' phase, a client tracks her Basal Body Temperature (BBT). What physiological event is confirmed by a sustained temperature rise of 0.5 to 1.0 degree Fahrenheit?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone has a thermogenic effect on the hypothalamus. A sustained rise in BBT confirms that ovulation has occurred and the corpus luteum is secreting progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' (Module 14) refers to the collection of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. Which enzyme, if elevated, can deconjugate estrogen in the gut, leading to its reabsorption into circulation?",

                "Pepsin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the 'de-toxified' estrogen to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream, contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "When addressing the 'O: Overcome Symptoms' phase for a client with hot flashes, which specific neuroendocrine mechanism is primarily responsible for the narrowing of the thermoregulatory zone?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The withdrawal of estrogen during perimenopause and menopause destabilizes the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus, largely mediated by changes in neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and serotonin."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "Regarding Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (M13), phthalates are frequently found in personal care products. What is their primary mechanism of action concerning male reproductive hormones?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phthalates are known anti-androgens that can impair the function of Leydig cells in the testes, leading to reduced testosterone production and potential reproductive issues."

            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "In Module 11 (Advanced Hormonal Interplay), the conversion of the pro-hormone T4 to the active T3 occurs primarily in which organs?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Approximately 60% of T4 to T3 conversion happens in the liver, and about 20% occurs in the gut (facilitated by healthy gut bacteria), making liver and gut health essential for thyroid function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rotterdam Criteria require at least two of the following: 1. Oligo- or anovulation, 2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, 3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must focus on education, lifestyle, and nutrition. Diagnosing, prescribing, or adjusting medications are clinical acts reserved for licensed medical professionals."

        {
            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "Which phase of liver detoxification (Module 10) involves the process of 'conjugation,' where a functional group (like methyl, sulfur, or glucuronic acid) is added to a toxin to make it water-soluble?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I (Cytochrome P450)",

            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "Leptin resistance (Module 7) is often a precursor to hormonal weight loss resistance. Where is leptin primarily produced, and what is its main function?",
            "options": [
                "Produced in the pancreas; regulates blood glucose.",
                "Produced in the thyroid; regulates metabolic rate.",
                "Produced in adipose tissue; signals satiety to the hypothalamus.",
                "Produced in the adrenals; regulates the stress response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells (adipose tissue) that communicates with the hypothalamus to signal that the body has enough energy (fat) stored, thereby suppressing appetite."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the luteal phase, the body’s metabolic rate increases and progesterone levels rise, making restorative movement and increased complex carbohydrates (to support serotonin and blood sugar) more appropriate than high-intensity stress."

            "id": "final_14",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis discussed in Module 19 examined the impact of Bisphenol A (BPA) on endocrine function. What was a primary finding regarding BPA and estrogen receptors?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is a xenoestrogen that can bind to both ER-alpha and ER-beta receptors, mimicking or blocking natural estrogen and disrupting the delicate hormonal balance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While coaches do not diagnose, they must recognize red flags. Central obesity, a buffalo hump, and purple stretch marks are hallmark signs of pathologically high cortisol (Cushing's), requiring immediate medical referral."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or more accurately, HPA axis shunting) suggests that under chronic stress, the precursor pregnenolone is diverted toward cortisol production at the expense of DHEA and progesterone."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone, acts as a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, which accounts for the anti-anxiety and sedative effects of progesterone."
