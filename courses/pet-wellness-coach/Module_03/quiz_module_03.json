            "question": "What is the primary differentiator between a 'Standard Care Plan' and a 'Customized Wellness Plan' as taught in the Foundations of Wellness planning?",
            "options": [
                "The use of prescription medications over supplements",
                "The integration of bio-individual data, including breed-specific predispositions and lifestyle stressors",
                "The requirement of a veterinarian to be the sole decision-maker",
                "A focus exclusively on caloric intake and weight management"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Customized wellness planning moves beyond generic care by integrating bio-individual data, including the pet's unique genetics, breed traits, environment, and specific lifestyle stressors to create a proactive rather than reactive strategy."

            "question": "In the context of Nutritional Optimization, research suggests that maintaining a specific Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio is critical for managing systemic inflammation. What is the target ratio recommended for optimal wellness?",

                "1:10 (Higher Omega-3 than Omega-6)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While many commercial diets have ratios as high as 20:1, nutritional optimization aims for a ratio between 4:1 and 2:1 to significantly reduce pro-inflammatory markers and support cellular health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Contrafreeloading is the observed phenomenon where animals choose to perform a task to obtain food even when identical food is freely available, which stimulates cognitive pathways and increases BDNF levels."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional fitness prioritizes the 'inner unit' first. Static balance and core stabilization must be mastered before moving to dynamic movement or high-intensity loads to prevent injury."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "The 'Stress Bucket' model in Behavioral Wellness explains 'Trigger Stacking.' According to the lesson, how long can cortisol levels remain significantly elevated in a pet after a single acute stress event?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cortisol levels can remain elevated for up to 72 hours after a stressful event. This is why 'trigger stacking' is dangerous; multiple small stressors within a 3-day window can lead to a behavioral threshold breach."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Recent feline geriatric research (n=150) has challenged older myths regarding protein intake. What is the current recommendation for healthy senior cats to prevent sarcopenia?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unless a cat has advanced Stage 3 or 4 Renal Disease, healthy senior cats require higher protein levels to combat sarcopenia (muscle wasting) and maintain metabolic health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'weekend warrior' pattern is a high risk for CCL tears and soft tissue injury. Micro-conditioning builds the necessary structural resilience in the tendons and ligaments through consistent, low-level loading."
