            "question": "In the Unified P.A.W.S. Workflow, what is the primary purpose of the 'Synthesis Phase' after collecting initial data across all four pillars?",
            "options": [
                "To choose the single most expensive supplement for the pet",
                "To identify the 'Root Driver' where multiple pillars intersect and influence one another",
                "To eliminate the need for veterinary consultation",
                "To focus exclusively on the Alimentary pillar as it is always the most important"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the process of looking at the intersections of the pillars (Physical, Alimentary, Wellness, Social) to find the underlying cause rather than treating symptoms in isolation."

                "Because pets eventually become immune to all medications",
                "Because it makes the pet's diet too complex to manage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polypharmacy in multi-morbid pets increases the risk of adverse reactions and places a heavy burden on the organs responsible for metabolizing those substances."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a high percentage (up to 80%) of dogs with behavioral sensitivities or aggression have underlying physical pain, necessitating a behavioral-physical integration."
