            "question": "When managing a multi-morbid client with both Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Diabetes Mellitus, which principle should guide the Wellness Coach's prioritization strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Always prioritize the diabetic diet as insulin regulation is more volatile.",
                "Prioritize the condition with the highest immediate morbidity risk while identifying 'nutritional bottlenecks'.",
                "Focus exclusively on the CKD diet as protein restriction is mandatory for all stages.",
                "Disregard specific dietary restrictions and focus only on caloric density."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In multi-morbidity, coaches must prioritize the condition posing the greatest immediate risk (morbidity/mortality) and look for 'nutritional bottlenecks'—areas where the treatment for one condition might contraindicate the other."

                "Excessive grooming of the tail base",
                "Muzzle tension and whisker change (flattened or bunched)",
                "Hyperactivity and increased jumping behavior"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Feline Grimace Scale specifically evaluates ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whisker position, and head position as validated markers of physical distress."

            "options": [
                "To determine the exact date for elective euthanasia",
                "To provide an objective, longitudinal assessment of Hurt, Hunger, Hydration, Hygiene, Happiness, Mobility, and More Good Days than Bad",
                "To track the efficacy of curative chemotherapy treatments",
                "To calculate the precise caloric requirements for geriatric weight gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HHHHHMM scale (developed by Dr. Alice Villalobos) is used in palliative care to provide a standardized way for owners and coaches to monitor quality of life and guide end-of-life decision-making."

                "Feeding a high-fiber meal immediately after exercise to slow digestion",
                "Providing a small, high-glycemic carbohydrate snack within 30-60 minutes post-exercise to replenish stores",
                "Total fasting for 12 hours post-event to allow the liver to rest",
                "Restricting water intake for 2 hours to prevent bloat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that replenishing glycogen stores within a 'metabolic window' (30-60 minutes) post-exercise is critical for sporting dogs to ensure rapid recovery and prevent muscle catabolism."

                "Excessive calcium buildup in the joints",
                "A dangerous shift in intracellular electrolytes, specifically hypophosphatemia, triggered by an insulin spike",

                "Sudden loss of appetite due to gastric distension"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Refeeding syndrome occurs when a malnourished animal is fed too many calories too quickly, causing an insulin surge that drives phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium into cells, leading to life-threatening serum deficiencies."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "In a client with suspected Hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's Disease), which electrolyte ratio is a classic diagnostic hallmark often discussed between the coach and the referring veterinarian?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium to Magnesium ratio (Ca:Mg)",
                "Sodium to Potassium ratio (Na:K) of less than 27:1",

                "Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addison's disease is characterized by a lack of mineralocorticoids, leading to hyponatremia (low sodium) and hyperkalemia (high potassium). A Na:K ratio below 27:1 (and especially below 20:1) is a strong indicator of an Addisonian crisis."

                "Unlimited access to high-calorie treats to counteract weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cushing's patients are prone to hyperlipidemia (high blood fats) and muscle wasting due to high cortisol. A low-fat, moderate-protein diet helps manage these risks while supporting metabolic stability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total Toxic Load (or Body Burden) is the sum of all chemical, biological, and physical stressors an animal is exposed to, which can eventually overwhelm the liver and kidneys' ability to maintain homeostasis."

                "Lack of intelligence or focus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Displacement behaviors are normal behaviors performed out of context (like grooming or sniffing) when an animal is experiencing conflict or emotional stress, signaling they have reached their threshold."

            "question": "A Wellness Coach discovers that a client is ignoring a veterinarian's prescription for heart medication in favor of a supplement the coach recommended for joint health. What is the ethically correct action?",

                "Encourage the client, as natural supplements are always safer than pharmaceuticals.",
                "Say nothing, as the coach's scope only covers the supplements provided.",
                "Immediately advise the client to follow the vet's prescription and clarify that wellness protocols are supportive, not replacements for medical treatment.",
                "Tell the client to double the dose of the joint supplement to compensate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional ethics and scope of practice require that wellness coaches ensure their recommendations do not interfere with veterinary medical plans. Coaches must prioritize client safety and the veterinary-client-patient relationship (VCPR)."
