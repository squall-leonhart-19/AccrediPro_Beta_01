            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity (Lesson 1), which protein is considered the primary 'fertilizer' for the brain, promoting the survival of existing neurons and the growth of new synapses?",
            "options": [
                "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BDNF is a key neurotrophin that supports neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus, and is significantly increased through environmental enrichment."
