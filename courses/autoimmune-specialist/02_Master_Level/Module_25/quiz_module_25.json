            "id": "q25_1",
            "question": "According to the Proctor Model of Clinical Supervision used in the CALM framework, which function focuses specifically on the practitioner's emotional well-being and stress management?",
            "options": ["Normative function", "Formative function", "Restorative function", "Administrative function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Restorative function (also known as the supportive function) focuses on the practitioner's emotional response to clinical work, preventing burnout and compassion fatigue in high-stakes autoimmune cases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "During a technical audit of the 'C' (Clear/Cleanse) phase, a supervisor identifies that a practitioner is implementing high-dose binders without assessing the client's Phase III detoxification (elimination) status. Why is this a critical clinical risk?",
            "options": ["It increases the risk of 're-circulation' and systemic toxicity if the client is constipated.", "It prevents the 'A' (Activate) phase from ever occurring.", "Binders are only effective in the 'M' (Maintenance) phase.", "It violates the 2022 Clinical Guidelines for Autoimmune Nutrition."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Auditing the 'C' phase requires ensuring that elimination pathways (bowel movements, hydration) are optimized before mobilizing toxins; otherwise, the client may suffer an inflammatory flare due to re-absorption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, statistics indicate that what percentage of autoimmune clients experience a 'Maintenance Lapse' within the first 90 days of the 'M' phase if supervision is withdrawn?",
            "options": ["Approximately 15%", "Approximately 32%", "Approximately 45%", "Approximately 68%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that without the accountability of the Maintenance (M) phase supervision, roughly 68% of clients revert to old inflammatory lifestyle habits within 90 days."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A practitioner reports feeling 'personally responsible' for a client's Rheumatoid Arthritis flare and begins working unpaid overtime to 'save' them. This is a classic example of:",
            "options": ["Positive Transference", "Parallel Process", "Countertransference (The Rescuer Archetype)", "Collaborative Leadership"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Countertransference occurs when the practitioner projects their own emotional needs or 'Rescuer' archetypes onto the client, which can lead to burnout and blurred professional boundaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "When coordinating a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) for a complex case of Systemic Sclerosis, what is the 'Primary Communication Protocol' recommended in Lesson 5?",
            "options": ["The 'Central Hub' model where the Autoimmune Specialist filters all data", "The 'Decentralized' model where all practitioners act independently", "The 'SBAR' (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) tool", "The 'Patient-Led' model where the client relays messages between doctors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SBAR tool is the industry standard for ensuring concise, accurate, and professional communication between specialists, reducing the risk of medical errors."

        {
            "id": "q25_6",
            "question": "In Clinical Outcome Analytics, a 'MCID' is used to determine if a client's progress is meaningful. What does MCID stand for?",
            "options": ["Maximum Clinical Inflammatory Degree", "Minimum Clinically Important Difference", "Mean Coefficient of Immune Dysfunction", "Major Clinical Intervention Data"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is the smallest change in a treatment outcome (like a HAQ or DAS28 score) that a patient would identify as important."

        {
            "id": "q25_7",
            "question": "Case Study: A supervisee wants to recommend a high-dose Curcumin supplement to a client taking Warfarin (a blood thinner). What is the supervisor’s mandatory ethical action?",
            "options": ["Approve it, as Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory.", "Tell the supervisee to have the client stop the Warfarin first.", "Flag the potential herb-drug interaction and require a physician consultation.", "Suggest the supervisee lower the dose of Curcumin to 100mg."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Risk management requires identifying contraindications. Curcumin has anti-platelet effects and can potentiate Warfarin, increasing bleeding risk; physician clearance is mandatory."

        {
            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "According to the pedagogical principles in Lesson 8, which stage of the 'Conscious Competence' learning model represents the highest level of mastery for a specialist?",
            "options": ["Conscious Incompetence", "Conscious Competence", "Unconscious Competence", "Unconscious Incompetence"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unconscious Competence is the stage where the specialist's skills are so deeply integrated that they can perform complex clinical reasoning automatically and accurately."

        {
            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, what is the primary purpose of a 'Run Chart' in Quality Assurance analytics?",
            "options": ["To track the practitioner's billing hours over a month", "To visualize trends and shifts in client inflammatory markers over time", "To compare the specialist's salary to industry averages", "To list the side effects of various immunosuppressants"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Run charts are used in quality improvement to monitor the performance of a process (like client CRP levels or pain scores) over time to see if interventions are causing sustained improvement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q25_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Parallel Process' in supervision?",
            "options": ["When the supervisor and supervisee see the same client at the same time", "When the supervisee treats the supervisor like a client", "When the dynamics between the practitioner and client are recreated in the relationship between the supervisor and practitioner", "When two different autoimmune protocols are run simultaneously"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel process occurs when the supervisee unconsciously recreates the client's behaviors or emotional states (e.g., helplessness or aggression) during the supervision session."
