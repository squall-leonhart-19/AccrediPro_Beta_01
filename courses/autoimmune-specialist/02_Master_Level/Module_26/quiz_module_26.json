            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Golden Thread' refers to the clinical narrative that links a client's history (antecedents), triggers, and mediators to their current physiological state."

                "Supplementing with 3 grams of Vitamin C daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 focuses on rapid stabilization by identifying and removing the top three most significant inflammatory triggers (dietary, environmental, or lifestyle) to lower the total toxic load."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to the Clinical Decision Trees in Phase 2, if a client presents with both gut dysbiosis and significant HPA-axis dysfunction, which is typically addressed first?",
            "options": [
                "Gut dysbiosis, because all health begins in the gut",
                "HPA-axis dysfunction, to stabilize the cortisol-mediated immune response before aggressive gut protocols",
                "Neither; they must be addressed at exactly the same time",
                "Heavy metal detoxification"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sequencing often requires stabilizing the HPA-axis first, as high or dysregulated cortisol can inhibit gut healing and exacerbate the immune response to antimicrobial protocols."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because IgG-mediated and T-cell mediated reactions can be delayed, a 72-hour window is required to accurately assess a client's response to a reintroduced food."

            "id": "q26_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The L3 methodology emphasizes 'Titration to Tolerance.' If a die-off reaction occurs, the practitioner should reduce the stimulus and increase support for elimination pathways."
