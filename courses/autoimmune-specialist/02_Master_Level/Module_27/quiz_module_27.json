            "question": "In Pediatric Autoimmunity (L1), what is a primary clinical distinction between Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and adult Rheumatoid Arthritis regarding extra-articular manifestations?",
            "options": [
                "JIA has a significantly higher risk of asymptomatic uveitis, requiring frequent slit-lamp exams.",
                "Adult RA is more likely to cause permanent growth plate fusion than JIA.",
                "JIA rarely involves systemic inflammation, whereas adult RA always does.",
                "JIA patients never test positive for Rheumatoid Factor (RF)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Up to 20-30% of children with oligoarticular JIA may develop uveitis, which is often asymptomatic but can lead to blindness, making regular ophthalmologic screening critical compared to adult RA protocols."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Th1 to Th2 shift' discussed in Lesson 2, why does Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) often go into remission during pregnancy while Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) may flare?",
            "options": [
                "Pregnancy increases Th17 cells which suppress RA but activate SLE.",
                "The shift toward Th2 dominance suppresses Th1-mediated diseases like RA but can exacerbate antibody-mediated Th2 diseases like SLE.",
                "Progesterone acts as a direct antagonist to TNF-alpha but stimulates B-cell hyperreactivity.",
                "Pregnancy induces a state of total immunosuppression that only affects joints."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pregnancy induces a Th2-dominant state to protect the fetus. Since RA is primarily a Th1-driven cell-mediated disease, it often improves. Conversely, SLE involves B-cell overactivity (Th2), which may be exacerbated by this hormonal shift."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, 'Inflammaging' in geriatric patients is characterized by a chronic increase in which specific proinflammatory cytokines, even in the absence of acute infection?",
            "options": [
                "IL-2 and IL-4",
                "IL-10 and TGF-beta",

                "IgE and Histamine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inflammaging is defined by a low-grade, chronic systemic inflammatory state marked by elevated levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), which contributes to the progression of autoimmune pathology in the elderly."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Open Window Theory' in elite athletes. What does this theory suggest regarding high-intensity training and autoimmunity?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity training permanently cures autoimmune symptoms through sweat detoxification.",
                "There is a 3-72 hour period post-exercise where the immune system is suppressed, increasing the risk of molecular mimicry from opportunistic infections.",
                "Athletes are immune to autoimmunity due to high Vitamin D levels.",
                "The 'window' refers to the period where T-regulatory cells are at their highest concentration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Open Window' theory suggests that following intense acute exercise, the immune system undergoes a period of transient suppression (3-72 hours), during which the risk of subclinical infections that could trigger autoimmune flares via molecular mimicry is increased."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In the context of Oncology (L5), why do Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) frequently cause Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs) that mimic autoimmune diseases?",
            "options": [
                "ICIs are made from animal proteins that cause serum sickness.",
                "They selectively destroy the thyroid gland and adrenal cortex.",
                "By blocking inhibitory pathways like PD-1 or CTLA-4, they 'remove the brakes' on T-cells, allowing them to attack healthy tissue.",
                "They increase the production of autoantibodies by 500% within the first 24 hours."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ICIs work by inhibiting the 'checkpoints' (PD-1, CTLA-4) that normally prevent T-cells from attacking the body. While this helps T-cells kill cancer, it simultaneously reduces self-tolerance, leading to autoimmune-like irAEs."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 defines 'Orphan Diseases' (Rare Diseases) in the United States as conditions affecting fewer than how many individuals?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, a rare or orphan disease is defined as a condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Regarding Lesson 7, what is the primary mechanism of 'Molecular Mimicry' in post-viral autoimmune syndromes?",
            "options": [
                "The virus physically hides inside a human cell to avoid detection.",
                "Viral peptides share structural similarities with host self-antigens, causing cross-reactive T or B cell responses.",
                "The virus mutates the host's DNA to produce viral proteins instead of human proteins.",
                "Viruses consume all the host's zinc, leading to thymic involution."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system identifies a viral protein sequence that is nearly identical to a human protein sequence. After clearing the virus, the 'primed' immune cells continue to attack the similar-looking human tissue."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Neuro-Autoimmunity (L8), which cell type is primarily responsible for secreting Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)?",
            "options": [
                "Activated Th17 cells",
                "Erythrocytes",
                "Oligodendrocytes",
                "Schwann cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Th17 cells are highly pathogenic in neuro-autoimmunity because they secrete IL-17 and MMPs, which break down the tight junctions of the Blood-Brain Barrier, allowing an influx of inflammatory cells into the CNS."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A postpartum client (L2) experiences a severe flare of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis 3 months after delivery. Which hormone, which rises during breastfeeding, is known to have pro-inflammatory, immunostimulatory effects?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen",
                "Progesterone",

                "Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolactin is not just for lactation; it is a potent immunostimulatory cytokine. High levels of prolactin in the postpartum period can stimulate both Th1 and Th2 responses, often triggering or worsening autoimmune thyroiditis."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "For a geriatric patient (L3) with multiple autoimmune conditions, 'Polypharmacy' is clinically defined as the regular use of at least how many medications?",
            "options": [
                "2 or more",
                "5 or more",
                "10 or more",
                "15 or more"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polypharmacy is generally defined as the concurrent use of 5 or more medications. In geriatric autoimmune care, this increases the risk of drug-drug interactions and adverse effects that can mimic or exacerbate disease symptoms."
