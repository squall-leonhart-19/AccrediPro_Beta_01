            "question": "A client with Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma) presents with a sudden blood pressure reading of 185/115 mmHg, a severe headache, and blurry vision. What is the most likely emergency condition?",
            "options": [
                "Hypertensive Urgency due to stress",
                "Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC)",

                "Acute Myocardial Infarction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scleroderma Renal Crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening complication characterized by malignant hypertension and rapidly progressive renal failure, occurring in approximately 5-10% of systemic sclerosis patients."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of Multi-System Organ Involvement (MSOI), what is the primary diagnostic challenge when distinguishing between systemic flares and opportunistic infections?",
            "options": [
                "Infections never cause elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",
                "Flares only occur in the evening while infections are constant",

                "Standard blood panels cannot detect viral loads in autoimmune patients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iatrogenic immunosuppression often blunts the body's natural inflammatory response, meaning a patient may have a severe infection without a high fever or typical leukocytosis, complicating the triage process."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to clinical data on refractory Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), what percentage of patients are classified as 'primary non-responders' to their first TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 30-40% of RA patients fail to achieve a significant clinical response (ACR20) with their first TNF inhibitor, requiring a transition to different mechanisms of action (e.g., IL-6 inhibitors or B-cell depletion)."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Extreme hyperferritinemia (often >10,000 ng/mL) is a key diagnostic indicator for MAS, reflecting the massive activation of the mononuclear phagocytic system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis typically follows a multistage progression: a flu-like prodrome, followed by acute psychiatric symptoms (psychosis/mania), and finally neurological 'crashes' involving seizures and autonomic dysfunction."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client who has been on 20mg of Prednisone daily for six months stops the medication 'cold turkey.' They present with extreme fatigue, nausea, and hypotension. What is the likely iatrogenic cause?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term glucocorticoid use suppresses the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis. Abrupt cessation prevents the body from producing endogenous cortisol, leading to a life-threatening adrenal crisis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker's research identifies that roughly 24-25% of the population has HLA-DR genotypes that make them unable to effectively recognize and clear biotoxins, leading to chronic multi-system inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In end-stage or palliative care, the focus shifts from 'cure' or 'reversal' to 'care'—using nutrition, stress management, and gentle movement to improve the client's remaining quality of life and reduce the burden of symptoms."
