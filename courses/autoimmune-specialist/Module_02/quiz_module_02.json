            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "In the context of antigen mapping, which mechanism describes the process where the immune system attacks host tissues because they share structural similarities with a foreign pathogen?",
            "options": [
                "Bystander Activation",
                "Molecular Mimicry",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when peptides from a pathogen are similar in sequence or structure to self-antigens, leading the immune system to cross-react and attack the body's own tissues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels are clinically associated with the suppression of Secretory IgA (sIgA), which reduces the gut's ability to neutralize pathogens before they enter the bloodstream."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which advanced laboratory test is specifically designed to measure 'Chemical Immune Reactivity' by looking at antibodies (IgG/IgA) against toxins like BPA, phthalates, and heavy metals?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cyrex Array 11 measures the immune system's specific reaction to chemicals bound to human proteins, rather than just the presence of the toxin itself."

                "Wait for the client to be in a full flare before intervening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Total Toxic Load (or Bucket Theory) suggests that reducing the easiest-to-control triggers first can lower the immune system's threshold of activation, making later interventions more effective."
