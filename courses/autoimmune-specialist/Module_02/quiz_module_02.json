            "question": "According to the Root Cause Framework, what are the three essential components of the 'Fasano Triad' required for the development of autoimmune disease?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic predisposition, chronic stress, and viral infection",
                "Genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger, and intestinal permeability",
                "Nutrient deficiency, heavy metal toxicity, and dysbiosis",
                "Molecular mimicry, HPA axis dysfunction, and food sensitivities"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Alessio Fasano's research established that autoimmunity requires a genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger (antigen), and a loss of intestinal barrier function (permeability)."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which protein is the primary physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions, often elevated in cases of 'Leaky Gut'?",

                "Occludin",
                "Claudin-1",
                "Zonulin",
                "Actin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels indicate the 'gates' of the intestinal barrier are open, allowing antigens to enter the bloodstream."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Microbiome-Immune Axis, what is the definition of 'Molecular Mimicry'?",
            "options": [
                "When the body produces identical copies of bacterial DNA",
                "When a pathogen's peptide sequence is similar to the host's self-peptides, causing immune cross-reactivity",
                "When the microbiome changes its species composition to match the host's diet",
                "When toxins from the environment mimic the shape of hormones like estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign antigen (like a protein from Klebsiella or EBV) with a self-antigen (like joint tissue or myelin) due to structural similarities."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Bjornevik et al. (2022) study provided the strongest evidence to date that EBV is a leading cause of MS, showing a 32-fold increase in risk after infection."

            "question": "How does chronic activation of the HPA axis contribute to autoimmune progression despite cortisol being an anti-inflammatory hormone?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the immune system to shut down entirely",
                "It leads to Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) resistance, where immune cells lose sensitivity to cortisol's 'stop' signal",
                "It increases the production of Regulatory T-cells (Tregs)",
                "It prevents the liver from detoxifying heavy metals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to 'Glucocorticoid Resistance,' where immune cells downregulate their receptors, meaning even high levels of cortisol can no longer suppress runaway inflammation."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which mechanism explains why a client with Celiac disease might also react to dairy (casein) even on a gluten-free diet?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cross-reactivity occurs when the immune system's antibodies for one protein (alpha-gliadin in gluten) recognize and attack a similar-looking protein (casein in dairy)."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "When prioritizing interventions using the Root Cause Matrix, why is 'biotransformation and elimination' (detox) usually addressed AFTER gut health?",
            "options": [
                "Because toxins are not important in autoimmunity",
                "Because the liver cannot function without high-fiber intake",
                "To prevent the recirculation of toxins via the enterohepatic circulation if the gut barrier is leaky",
                "Because gut protocols are less expensive than detox protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a client has a 'leaky gut,' toxins mobilized during a detox protocol can be reabsorbed into the bloodstream (enterohepatic recirculation), causing a 'healing crisis' or symptom flare."

            "id": "q2_8",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are the 'peacekeepers' of the immune system; they suppress inflammatory responses to food and commensal bacteria to maintain oral tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mycotoxins cause significant oxidative stress and deplete glutathione, the body's master antioxidant, which impairs the immune system's ability to regulate itself."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A client presents with Hashimoto's, chronic bloating, and high work stress. Using the prioritization matrix, which should be the first clinical focus?",

                "Aggressive antimicrobial therapy for stealth pathogens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the Root Cause Matrix, the foundation (Nervous System/HPA Axis) and the Gateway (Gut/Intestinal Permeability) must be addressed first to create the stability needed for more aggressive protocols like chelation or antimicrobials."
