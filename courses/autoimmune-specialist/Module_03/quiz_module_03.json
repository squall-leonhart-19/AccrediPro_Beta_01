            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which transcription factor is considered the 'master regulator' for the development and suppressive function of T-regulatory (Treg) cells?",
            "options": [
                "NF-κB",
                "FOXP3",
                "T-bet",
                "GATA3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FOXP3 (Forkhead box P3) is the essential transcription factor for the development and inhibitory function of Treg cells; mutations in the FOXP3 gene lead to severe multi-organ autoimmune diseases."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client with Rheumatoid Arthritis presents with elevated Th17 activity. According to the module, which nutritional intervention is most effective at inhibiting the Th17 pathway while promoting Treg differentiation?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose Iron supplementation",
                "Isolated Leucine administration",
                "Curcumin combined with EGCG (Green Tea Extract)",
                "Excessive Omega-6 fatty acid intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Curcumin and EGCG have been shown in clinical studies to synergistically inhibit the Th17 developmental pathway and IL-17 production while simultaneously inducing FOXP3+ Treg cells."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "For optimal immune modulation and VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) activation in autoimmune patients, what is the target clinical range for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]?",
            "options": [
                "20–30 ng/mL",
                "30–50 ng/mL",
                "60–80 ng/mL",
                "120–150 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' laboratory ranges start at 30 ng/mL, the 'optimal' range for autoimmune modulation and maximal VDR genomic signaling is generally considered 60–80 ng/mL."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "How do Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs), such as Resolvins and Protectins, differ from traditional anti-inflammatory agents like NSAIDs?",
            "options": [
                "SPMs block the COX-2 enzyme entirely, whereas NSAIDs do not",
                "SPMs facilitate the active resolution of inflammation and clearance of debris without suppressing the initial immune response",
                "SPMs increase the production of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)",
                "SPMs are only effective in acute injury and have no role in chronic autoimmunity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike anti-inflammatories that 'block' pathways, SPMs are 'pro-resolving,' meaning they actively signal the end of the inflammatory cycle, promote efferocytosis (clearing of cellular debris), and support tissue regeneration."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) is used as an immunomodulator in autoimmunity. What is its primary mechanism of action at dosages between 1.5mg and 4.5mg?",
            "options": [
                "Permanent blockade of opioid receptors to prevent pain",
                "Direct inhibition of the thyroid gland to reduce TPO antibodies",
                "A transient blockade of opioid receptors that triggers a 'rebound' increase in endogenous endorphins and Met-enkephalin",
                "Stimulation of Th17 cells to increase systemic defense"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LDN works through a 'rebound effect.' By briefly blocking opioid receptors (usually at night), the body compensates by increasing production of endorphins, which then bind to receptors on immune cells to modulate (balance) their activity."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "The 'Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway' (CAP) describes how the Vagus Nerve reduces systemic inflammation. Which specific receptor on macrophages must acetylcholine bind to in order to inhibit cytokine release?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR)",
                "Beta-2 adrenergic receptor",
                "Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)",
                "Glucocorticoid receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The α7nAChR is the key receptor on macrophages that, when activated by acetylcholine from the vagus nerve, inhibits the translocation of NF-κB and reduces the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In a 2022 study cited in the module, regular meditation was shown to affect the 'Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity' (CTRA). This results in which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes",
                "Decreased expression of antiviral genes",
                "Downregulation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling and upregulation of Type I interferon activity",
                "Total suppression of the HPA axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mind-body interventions like meditation shift the CTRA profile by downregulating pro-inflammatory genes (mediated by NF-κB) and improving the body's innate antiviral response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "When tracking 'Regulatory Success' via biomarkers, which of the following cytokine profiles would most likely indicate a client is moving toward clinical remission?",
            "options": [
                "High IL-17 and Low IL-10",
                "Low TGF-beta and High TNF-alpha",
                "High IL-10 and decreasing hs-CRP",
                "High IL-6 and High ESR"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IL-10 is the primary anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by Tregs. An increase in IL-10 paired with a decrease in systemic inflammatory markers like hs-CRP indicates successful regulatory modulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'VDR BsmI' polymorphism. Based on the 'Master Regulator' lesson, how should this influence your nutritional strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D should be avoided entirely due to toxicity risk",
                "The client likely requires higher-than-average serum levels of 25(OH)D to achieve effective immune receptor binding",
                "The client should only take Vitamin A, as Vitamin D will not work",
                "The polymorphism has no impact on clinical outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VDR polymorphisms (like BsmI, TaqI, or FokI) can reduce the sensitivity of the Vitamin D receptor. Clients with these variants often need higher serum levels (e.g., 70-90 ng/mL) to overcome this 'resistance' and achieve immune modulation."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to the module data, what is the target ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids recommended to significantly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins?",
            "options": [
                "20:1",
                "15:1",
                "10:1",
                "4:1 or lower"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet often reaches 15:1 or 20:1, a therapeutic ratio of 4:1 or lower (ideally 2:1) is required to shift the cell membrane composition toward an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving state."
