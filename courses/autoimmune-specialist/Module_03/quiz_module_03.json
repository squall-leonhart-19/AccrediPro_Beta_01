            "question": "What is the primary physiological mechanism by which the 'Elimination Phase' of the AIP protocol reduces systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "By inducing a state of permanent ketosis to starve inflammatory bacteria.",
                "By removing molecular mimics and ligands that trigger TLR4 (Toll-Like Receptor 4) activation in the gut lining.",
                "By increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines to 'flush' the system.",
                "By reducing the total caloric intake to below 1,200 calories per day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The elimination phase focuses on removing dietary triggers that cause molecular mimicry or activate the innate immune system via TLR4, thereby reducing intestinal permeability and systemic 'leaks' of inflammatory markers."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which micronutrient, discussed in Lesson 2, is essential for the induction of FOXP3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells to maintain immune tolerance?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Calcium Carbonate",
                "Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3)",
                "Vitamin K1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D acts as a potent immunomodulator; it specifically promotes the differentiation of T-regulatory cells, which are responsible for preventing the immune system from attacking 'self' tissue."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in Lesson 3 found that 'Social Jetlag' (shifting sleep times by >2 hours on weekends) resulted in which physiological outcome?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in IL-6 levels and decreased insulin sensitivity.",
                "A 30% improvement in mitochondrial density due to 'recovery sleep'.",
                "No significant change in inflammatory markers if total sleep duration was met.",
                "A decrease in cortisol production during the morning peak."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Social jetlag disrupts the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, leading to a measurable increase in systemic inflammation (IL-6) and metabolic dysfunction, even if total hours of sleep are sufficient."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the 'Goldilocks Zone' of exercise prescription for autoimmune clients, why is excessive high-intensity exercise contraindicated during a flare?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an immediate permanent loss of muscle mass.",
                "It promotes excessive ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) production that overwhelms compromised mitochondrial antioxidant capacity.",
                "It lowers the heart rate too significantly for safe recovery.",
                "It increases the absorption of nutrients too quickly for the gut to handle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune clients often have mitochondrial dysfunction; excessive intensity produces a 'burst' of ROS that their systems cannot neutralize, leading to oxidative stress and prolonged flares."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "High Vagal Tone, measured via Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is associated with which effect on the 'Neuro-Endocrine-Immune' axis?",

                "Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve communicates with the immune system via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; high vagal tone signals the spleen and other organs to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which environmental hygiene strategy is most critical for a client with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, according to the 'Total Load' theory?",

                "Using plastic containers (BPA/BPS) for hot liquids.",
                "Filtering drinking water to remove halides like fluoride and chlorine which compete for iodine receptors.",
                "Using high-fragrance cleaning products to ensure a sterile environment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Halides (Fluoride, Chlorine, Bromine) can competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid gland, exacerbating Hashimoto's symptoms and thyroid dysfunction."

            "question": "Research on the 'ACE' (Adverse Childhood Experiences) score indicates that a score of 2 or higher increases the risk of autoimmune hospitalization by approximately how much?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "25%",

                "It actually decreases the risk due to 'hormetic stress'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark ACE study showed that early life trauma creates a pro-inflammatory 'set-point' in the immune system, nearly doubling the risk (70-100% increase) of developing autoimmune conditions in adulthood."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "When using Implementation Science (Lesson 8), what is the most effective coaching approach for a client in the 'Contemplation' stage of change?",
            "options": [
                "Providing a rigid 30-day meal plan with strict rules.",

                "Ignoring their concerns and focusing only on lab results."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the contemplation stage, the client is aware of the problem but not yet committed to action. Exploring ambivalence helps them resolve internal conflicts and move toward the 'Preparation' stage."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A client with Rheumatoid Arthritis reports that her symptoms worsen significantly during periods of high work stress. This is likely due to 'Glucocorticoid Resistance,' which is:",
            "options": [
                "When the body stops producing cortisol entirely.",
                "When immune cells become less sensitive to cortisol's anti-inflammatory signals due to chronic overexposure.",
                "When the client becomes addicted to prednisone.",
                "When the liver cannot process glucose effectively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to constant cortisol elevation; eventually, the receptors on immune cells downregulate (become 'resistant'), meaning cortisol can no longer effectively 'turn off' the inflammatory response."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which specific 'Nutritional Density' metric is prioritized in the AIP framework to support tissue repair (Lesson 2)?",
            "options": [
                "The ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids (aiming for 1:1 to 4:1).",
                "The total grams of fiber, regardless of source.",
                "The number of calories consumed before noon.",
                "The percentage of protein derived from soy isolates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The AIP framework emphasizes a low Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio to reduce the substrate available for pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production, which is vital for resolving chronic inflammation."
