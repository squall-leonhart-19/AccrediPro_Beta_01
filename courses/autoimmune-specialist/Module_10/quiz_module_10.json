            "question": "In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), what is the primary target of the autoimmune attack, and which protein is most frequently identified as the autoantigen?",
            "options": [
                "The axon; Neurofilament light chain",
                "The myelin sheath; Myelin Basic Protein (MBP)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MS is characterized by the immune system attacking the protective myelin sheath. Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) is one of the most common targets for T-cell reactivity in MS patients."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myasthenia Gravis is a classic autoimmune disease where antibodies (usually anti-AChR) interfere with the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular junction."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "When microglia become 'primed' due to chronic systemic inflammation, how do they respond to a secondary immune challenge?",
            "options": [
                "They enter a dormant state to protect the brain",
                "They produce an exaggerated, hyper-inflammatory response (M1 phenotype)",

                "They increase the production of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Microglial priming means the cells are 'stuck' in a pre-activated state. A secondary trigger (like a minor infection) causes them to release excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to brain fog and neurodegeneration."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BHB is not just a fuel source; it acts as a signaling molecule that inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the production of IL-1b and IL-18 in the brain."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lion's Mane contains hericenones and erinacines that can cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate NGF, which is essential for the survival of neurons and the process of remyelination."
