            "question": "In the context of molecular mimicry, which Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) protein demonstrates significant structural homology with Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), potentially triggering Multiple Sclerosis?",
            "options": [
                "LMP-1",
                "EBNA-1",
                "BZLF1",
                "GP350"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBNA-1 (Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1) is the primary protein implicated in molecular mimicry with MBP. Research indicates that antibodies against EBNA-1 can cross-react with myelin, driving the neuro-inflammatory response seen in MS."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, induce the differentiation of T-regulatory (Treg) cells through which primary epigenetic mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Activation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)",
                "Inhibition of Histone Deacetylases (HDACs)",
                "Upregulation of the mTOR pathway",
                "Phosphorylation of STAT3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate acts as a natural HDAC inhibitor. By inhibiting HDACs, it promotes the acetylation of the Foxp3 promoter region, which is the master transcription factor for the development and function of immunosuppressive Treg cells."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to the Cell Danger Response (CDR) model developed by Dr. Robert Naviaux, what is the hallmark metabolic shift during the CDR1 (Innate Immune Activation) phase?",
            "options": [
                "Shift from anaerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation",
                "Increased mitochondrial fusion and high ATP production",
                "Shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and extracellular ATP release",
                "Downregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In CDR1, cells shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (similar to the Warburg effect) to prioritize defense over housekeeping. This phase is also characterized by the release of ATP into the extracellular space as a DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern)."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "A client presents with chronically elevated serum cortisol but simultaneously high levels of systemic inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6). This clinical picture most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Primary Adrenal Insufficiency",
                "Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) Insensitivity",
                "Suppression of the HPA Axis",
                "Excessive Th2 cytokine dominance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) Insensitivity occurs when chronic stress or inflammation causes the receptors to become less responsive. This results in the loss of the 'braking' mechanism on the immune system, allowing inflammation to persist despite high cortisol levels."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, utilizes which mechanism to maintain a 'stealth' infection and evade the host immune system?",

                "VlsE antigenic variation",
                "Production of high-affinity IgE antibodies",

                "Inhibition of the intestinal mucus layer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Borrelia uses VlsE (Variable major protein-like sequence, Expressed) antigenic variation to constantly change its surface proteins, making it a moving target that the adaptive immune system struggles to identify and clear."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Estrogen's effect on the immune system is 'biphasic.' How does high-level (pregnancy-level) Estrogen typically influence the Th1/Th2 balance?",
            "options": [
                "It shifts the response toward Th1 dominance, increasing cellular immunity",
                "It has no effect on T-cell differentiation",
                "It shifts the response toward Th2 dominance, promoting humoral immunity and anti-inflammatory effects",
                "It induces the immediate apoptosis of all B-cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High levels of estrogen, such as during pregnancy, typically promote a Th2-dominant environment and increase Treg activity. This is why many women with Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases (like RA or MS) experience temporary remission during pregnancy."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Which metabolite produced by the gut microbiota is a potent ligand for GPR43 and is essential for maintaining the integrity of the distal gut-immune axis?",
            "options": [
                "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)",
                "Propionate",

                "Secondary Bile Acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Propionate (an SCFA) is a key ligand for G-protein coupled receptor 43 (GPR43). Activation of GPR43 on immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells helps modulate inflammation and maintain the gut barrier."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In mitochondrial dysfunction associated with autoimmunity, the 'leaking' of which substance into the cytosol triggers the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)",
                "Glucose-6-phosphate",
                "Magnesium ions",
                "Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When mitochondria are damaged and not cleared via mitophagy, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can leak into the cytosol. The innate immune system recognizes mtDNA as a 'danger signal,' activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent IL-1β production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Which Biological Response Modifier (BRM) is specifically noted for its ability to inhibit the NF-kB pathway and reduce the production of TNF-alpha in autoimmune protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Curcumin (as Meriva or phytosome)",
                "Calcium Carbonate",
                "Iron Bisglycinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin is a well-studied BRM that modulates multiple inflammatory pathways, most notably inhibiting NF-kB, which is the 'master switch' for pro-inflammatory cytokine production including TNF-alpha and IL-6."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "The 'Hit and Run' hypothesis in viral-induced autoimmunity suggests that:",
            "options": [
                "The virus must remain active and replicating to cause tissue damage",
                "A transient viral infection triggers an immune cascade that persists even after the virus is cleared",
                "Viruses only cause autoimmunity in the presence of heavy metal toxicity",
                "Autoimmunity is caused by the physical presence of viral capsids in the joints"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Hit and Run' hypothesis proposes that a virus can initiate an autoimmune process (through mechanisms like molecular mimicry or bystander activation) and then be cleared by the host, while the self-perpetuating immune attack on host tissues continues."
