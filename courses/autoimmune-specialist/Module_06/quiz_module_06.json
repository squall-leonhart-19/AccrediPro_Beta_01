            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "According to recent epidemiological research, what percentage of the risk for developing an autoimmune disease is attributed to environmental factors (the exposome) rather than genetics alone?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-20%",
                "Approximately 30-50%",
                "Approximately 70-90%",
                "Exactly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While genetics provide the 'loaded gun,' the exposome (environmental factors) accounts for an estimated 70-90% of the risk, acting as the 'trigger' for autoimmune expression."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mercury is a potent immunotoxin that can interfere with DNA methylation, leading to the overexpression of genes involved in T-cell activation and the subsequent development of SLE."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Bisphenol A (BPA) and other xenoestrogens contribute to autoimmune flares primarily by binding to which receptors and shifting the immune system toward a Th2-dominant response?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs like BPA mimic natural estrogen and bind to estrogen receptors, which can enhance B-cell autoreactivity and stimulate a Th2-dominant inflammatory environment."

            "question": "In the context of Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), what is the significance of the HLA-DR/DQ genetic marker found in roughly 25% of the population?",
            "options": [
                "It makes the individual immune to mold exposure.",
                "It prevents the liver from processing Phase I toxins.",
                "It results in an inability of the immune system to recognize and tag mycotoxins for removal.",
                "It causes an overproduction of Vitamin D in response to toxins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with certain HLA-DR/DQ haplotypes cannot effectively present mycotoxin antigens to the immune system, leading to a chronic, systemic inflammatory state because the toxins are never cleared."
