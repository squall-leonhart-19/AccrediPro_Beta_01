            "question": "In the context of Celiac Disease, what is the specific role of the enzyme Tissue Transglutaminase 2 (tTG2) in the pathogenesis of the condition?",
            "options": [
                "It deamidates gliadin peptides, increasing their binding affinity for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 molecules",
                "It acts as a primary barrier protein in the tight junctions of the small intestine",
                "It neutralizes zonulin to prevent intestinal permeability",
                "It directly digests gluten into non-toxic amino acid sequences"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "tTG2 deamidates glutamine residues in gliadin into negatively charged glutamic acid, which significantly enhances their binding to HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 on antigen-presenting cells, triggering a robust T-cell response."

            "question": "Which histological feature is a defining characteristic of Crohn’s Disease that distinguishes it from Ulcerative Colitis?",
            "options": [
                "Inflammation limited strictly to the mucosal and submucosal layers",
                "Transmural inflammation that can lead to fistulas and strictures",
                "Continuous involvement starting from the rectum and moving proximally",
                "The absence of 'skip lesions' throughout the gastrointestinal tract"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crohn’s Disease is characterized by transmural inflammation (affecting all layers of the bowel wall), which often results in complications like fistulas, whereas Ulcerative Colitis is typically limited to the mucosa."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In clinical practice, achieving 'mucosal healing' in Ulcerative Colitis is often defined by which score on the Mayo Endoscopic subscore?",
            "options": [
                "A score of 3 (Severe disease with spontaneous bleeding)",
                "A score of 2 (Moderate disease with erosions)",
                "A score of 0 or 1 (Normal mucosa or mild erythema/decreased vascular pattern)",
                "A score of 5 (Complete transmural cicatrization)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mucosal healing, a key therapeutic target in IBD, is defined as a Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) of 0 or 1, which is associated with better long-term outcomes and lower flare rates."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMA is highly specific (95%) for Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), a condition characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Gut-Liver Axis' model, how does intestinal dysbiosis contribute to Autoimmune Hepatitis progression?",
            "options": [
                "Translocation of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) via the portal vein activates TLR4 receptors in the liver, fueling inflammation",
                "The liver produces excess bile which kills beneficial Bifidobacterium in the colon",
                "The gut absorbs too much Vitamin A, which becomes hepatotoxic",
                "High levels of butyrate in the gut cause the liver to produce Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies (ASMA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Increased intestinal permeability allows LPS (endotoxins) to enter the portal circulation, where they activate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on Kupffer cells, triggering pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the liver."

                "Significantly less effective than corticosteroids for inducing remission",
                "Comparable to corticosteroids in inducing clinical remission, particularly in pediatric populations (approx. 80-85% success)",
                "Only effective if combined with high-dose methotrexate",
                "Contraindicated for patients with active ileal inflammation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that EED can induce remission in 80-85% of pediatric Crohn's cases, a rate comparable to corticosteroids, while also promoting superior mucosal healing and nutritional status."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The De Simone Formulation (a high-potency 8-strain blend) has multiple randomized controlled trials supporting its efficacy in preventing the recurrence of pouchitis in UC patients."

            "options": [
                "Can safely consume barley but not wheat",
                "Lacks the characteristic villous atrophy and positive tTG-IgA antibodies",
                "Has a 100% chance of developing colon cancer if they eat gluten",
                "Does not experience any extra-intestinal symptoms like 'brain fog'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NCGS is characterized by symptomatic improvement on a gluten-free diet despite lacking the enteropathy (villous atrophy) and specific serological markers (tTG-IgA) required for a Celiac diagnosis."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which 'Postbiotics' like Butyrate support the intestinal barrier in IBD patients?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the pH of the lumen to inhibit all bacterial growth",
                "By acting as the primary energy source for colonocytes and inducing T-regulatory (Treg) cells",
                "By binding to gluten and preventing its absorption",
                "By stimulating the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (postbiotic), provides up to 70% of the energy requirements for colonocytes and promotes the differentiation of Treg cells, which suppress intestinal inflammation."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In the GI Case Study regarding 'Refractory Celiac Disease' (RCD), what is a critical clinical distinction between Type I and Type II RCD?",
            "options": [
                "Type I is treated with gluten, while Type II is treated with dairy",
                "Type II involves a clonal population of aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes and carries a higher risk of lymphoma",
                "Type I only affects the esophagus, while Type II affects the colon",
                "There is no clinical difference; the terms are used interchangeably"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type II RCD is defined by the presence of a clonal T-cell population and has a much poorer prognosis, with a significantly higher risk of progressing to Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphoma (EATL)."
