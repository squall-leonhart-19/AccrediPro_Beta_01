            "question": "In the context of Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), which mechanism best describes how chronic psychological stress leads to systemic inflammation despite high cortisol levels?",
            "options": [
                "The exhaustion of the adrenal glands leads to zero cortisol production.",
                "Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) resistance, where immune cells downregulate receptor sensitivity or expression.",
                "The immediate conversion of cortisol into pro-inflammatory estrogen in the liver.",
                "A total shutdown of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucocorticoid Resistance (GCR) occurs when chronic stress causes immune cells to reduce their sensitivity to cortisol, often through the upregulation of the GR-beta isoform, which inhibits the anti-inflammatory action of GR-alpha."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "The Cholinergic Anti-Inflammatory Pathway (CAP) is primarily mediated by which cranial nerve and neurotransmitter combination?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve releases Acetylcholine, which binds to alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR) on macrophages, inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to the 2009 study by Dube et al. on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), an ACE score of 2 or more was associated with what increase in the risk of rheumatic disease hospitalizations?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates a strong dose-response relationship between childhood trauma and autoimmune risk, with an ACE score of 2+ significantly increasing the likelihood of hospitalizations for autoimmune conditions by 70-100%."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "How does Triiodothyronine (T3) directly influence the immune system beyond its role in metabolic rate?",
            "options": [
                "It inhibits the production of all T-cells in the thymus.",

                "It triggers the immediate apoptosis of all Natural Killer (NK) cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 is an immune modulator that enhances the functional capacity of dendritic cells and promotes Th1-mediated immunity; this explains why thyroid dysfunction often exacerbates autoimmune pathology."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Regarding sexual dimorphism in autoimmunity, why are females generally more susceptible to B-cell mediated diseases like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen has a biphasic effect; at physiological levels, it promotes B-cell maturation and survival, while also inhibiting the negative selection of self-reactive B-cells, contributing to the female predominance in SLE."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CDR1 is the 'Inflammation' phase where the cell shifts its metabolism to prioritize defense over housekeeping, characterized by the release of ATP into the extracellular space and a shift toward glycolysis (the Warburg effect)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonant breathing and cold exposure are validated methods to increase vagal tone, improve HRV, and activate the CAP, which helps re-establish the neuro-endocrine balance."
