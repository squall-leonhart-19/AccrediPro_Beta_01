        {
            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In patients presenting with overlapping Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren’s Syndrome, which autoantibody profile is most strongly associated with the 'Sicca' complex and increased risk of neonatal heart block?",
            "options": ["Anti-dsDNA and Anti-Sm", "Anti-Ro (SSA) and Anti-La (SSB)", "Anti-centromere and Anti-Scl-70", "c-ANCA and p-ANCA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anti-Ro (SSA) and Anti-La (SSB) are the hallmark antibodies for Sjögren’s and are frequently found in SLE overlap cases, carrying specific risks for secondary complications like neonatal heart block in pregnancy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A refractory Ulcerative Colitis patient fails to respond to TNF-alpha inhibitors. Statistically, what percentage of IBD patients are estimated to be 'primary non-responders' to their first biologic therapy?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "30-40%", "60-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that approximately 30-40% of IBD patients are primary non-responders to initial biologic therapy, requiring advanced case management and switching of therapeutic classes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In Neuro-autoimmunity cases like PANS/PANDAS, the 'Cunningham Panel' measures antibodies that target which specific area of the brain through molecular mimicry?",
            "options": ["Prefrontal Cortex", "Hippocampus", "Basal Ganglia", "Cerebellum"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PANS/PANDAS involves an autoimmune response where antibodies cross the blood-brain barrier and target the basal ganglia, leading to the sudden onset of OCD and tic disorders."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Regarding the Environmental Exposome in Hashimoto’s, which halogen is known to competitively inhibit the Sodium-Iodide Symporter (NIS), effectively blocking iodine uptake even when dietary intake is sufficient?",
            "options": ["Fluoride", "Perchlorate", "Bromide", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, Perchlorate, and Bromide are all part of the environmental exposome that can competitively inhibit iodine uptake at the NIS, exacerbating Hashimoto's symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the Metabolic-Autoimmune crossroads of PCOS and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), how does hyperinsulinemia contribute to joint degradation?",
            "options": ["By decreasing synovial fluid viscosity", "By stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6", "By inducing osteoblast apoptosis", "By increasing uric acid crystallization"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia in PCOS promotes a pro-inflammatory state that increases the synthesis of TNF-α and IL-6, which are the same drivers responsible for joint destruction in RA."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A pediatric patient with Oligoarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is at high risk for 'silent' inflammation of which organ system, requiring screening every 3-4 months?",
            "options": ["Renal (Glomerulonephritis)", "Cardiac (Pericarditis)", "Ophthalmological (Uveitis)", "Hepatic (Autoimmune Hepatitis)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with JIA, particularly those who are ANA positive, have a significantly high risk of asymptomatic uveitis, which can lead to blindness if not caught by regular slit-lamp exams."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "During an 'Acute Flare' crisis intervention (Lesson 7), what is the primary clinical objective of the 'Stabilization Phase'?",
            "options": ["Identifying the root cause of the flare", "Tapering existing medications", "Rapid suppression of systemic inflammation to prevent organ damage", "Introducing long-term lifestyle modifications"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The stabilization phase of a crisis focuses on immediate suppression of the inflammatory cascade (often using high-dose corticosteroids or biologics) to prevent permanent tissue or organ damage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Path to Remission' protocols, what is the definition of 'Deep Remission' in Crohn’s Disease?",
            "options": ["Absence of abdominal pain for 30 days", "Normal CRP levels and weight gain", "Combined clinical remission (symptom-free) and endoscopic mucosal healing", "Reduction of medication dosage by 50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deep Remission is a stringent target that requires both the absence of clinical symptoms and the objective evidence of mucosal healing via endoscopy."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "When managing a 'Toxic Load' case in Hashimoto's (Lesson 4), why is it critical to support Phase II liver detoxification before mobilizing heavy metals or biotoxins?",
            "options": ["To prevent the 'recirculation' of toxins and acute inflammatory flares", "To increase the absorption of thyroid medication", "To lower TPO antibodies directly", "To stimulate TSH production"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Mobilizing toxins without adequate Phase II conjugation capacity leads to the 'recirculation' of toxins, which can trigger significant autoimmune flares and systemic toxicity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In the case study of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and JIA, what is the 'Honeymoon Phase' and why is it significant for intervention?",
            "options": ["The period after diagnosis where insulin needs increase", "A temporary period of beta-cell recovery where some endogenous insulin is still produced", "The first 3 months of dietary changes", "The period where joint pain disappears before skin rashes appear"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The honeymoon phase is a critical window in T1D where remaining beta-cell function persists; aggressive immunomodulation during this time aims to preserve this function as long as possible."
