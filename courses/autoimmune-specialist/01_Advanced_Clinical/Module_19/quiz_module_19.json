            "question": "Research into the 'Exposome' and epigenetics suggests that approximately what percentage of the risk for developing most autoimmune conditions is attributed to environmental factors rather than genetics?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "30-40%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While genetics provide the 'loaded gun,' environmental factors (the exposome) are responsible for approximately 60-70% of the risk in most autoimmune diseases, triggering the epigenetic expression of those genes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve provides a direct link between the brain and the immune system; its activation releases acetylcholine, which binds to alpha-7 nicotinic receptors on macrophages to reduce inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that Vitamin D acts synergistically with anti-TNF agents, potentially increasing responsiveness to the medication and lowering the risk of secondary loss of response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NNT provides a practical clinical perspective on efficacy; the lower the NNT, the more effective the intervention is for the average client."

                "Thyroid antibodies (TPO) dropped to zero in all participants",
                "TSH levels were significantly reduced in 100% of cases",
                "Significant improvements in quality of life occurred despite no significant change in thyroid antibodies",
                "Participants required higher doses of Levothyroxine after the study"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study showed that while symptoms and quality of life improved drastically, thyroid antibodies did not see a statistically significant change, highlighting that 'remission' of symptoms can precede 'serological' remission."
