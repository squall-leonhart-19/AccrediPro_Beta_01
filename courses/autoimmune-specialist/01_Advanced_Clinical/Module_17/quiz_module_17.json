            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type 2 MAS is characterized by the coexistence of Sjögren’s syndrome, RA, PBC, and Scleroderma. Type 1 involves Myasthenia gravis and thymoma, while Type 3 includes conditions like SLE and Hashimoto's."

            "question": "A pediatric client presents with the sudden, 'overnight' onset of severe OCD symptoms and restrictive eating following a streptococcal infection. Which diagnostic marker is most indicative of PANDAS in the Cunningham Panel?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated ANA titers > 1:160",
                "Low Serum IgA levels",
                "Elevated Anti-Dopamine Receptor D1 and D2 antibodies",
                "Positive HLA-B27 genetic marker"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cunningham Panel specifically tests for autoimmune encephalopathy markers, including Anti-Dopamine Receptor D1, D2, Anti-Lysoganglioside GM1, and Anti-Tubulin, which are characteristic of PANS/PANDAS."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Research indicates that approximately what percentage of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients experience a significant disease flare within 3 to 6 months postpartum?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While many RA patients experience remission during pregnancy due to the Th2 shift, studies show that over 90% of RA patients experience a significant flare postpartum as the immune system shifts back to a Th1/Th17 dominant state."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Stealth Pathogens,' what is the primary function of the Extracellular Polymeric Substance (EPS) matrix in a mature biofilm?",
            "options": [
                "To speed up the replication rate of the bacteria",
                "To provide a physical and chemical shield against antibiotics and host immune cells",

                "To transport oxygen to the center of the bacterial colony"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The EPS matrix acts as a protective shield, making the pathogens within the biofilm up to 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics and virtually invisible to the host’s immune system."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which protein, when found at elevated levels in the serum, serves as a validated clinical biomarker for Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) disruption and potential neuro-autoimmunity?",

                "Alkaline Phosphatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "S100B is a calcium-binding protein primarily found in astrocytes. When the BBB is compromised, S100B leaks into the systemic circulation, making it a key marker for 'leaky brain' and neuroinflammation."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A 'Non-Responder' client with Celiac disease remains symptomatic despite a strict gluten-free diet. According to cross-reactivity studies, which food protein is most likely to be recognized by the body as 'gluten' due to molecular mimicry?",
            "options": [
                "Casein (Dairy)",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Casein in dairy is one of the most common cross-reactive proteins for gluten-sensitive individuals. In 'Non-Responders,' eliminating dairy is often the necessary next step to resolve symptoms."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "When a client is taking Methotrexate for an autoimmune condition, which nutrient must be supplemented (usually 24 hours after the dose) to prevent toxicity and reduce side effects?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Folic Acid (or 5-MTHF)",

                "Magnesium Malate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methotrexate is a folate antagonist. Supplementing with Folic Acid or Folinic acid is standard practice to prevent side effects like mouth sores, liver toxicity, and hair loss."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Geriatric autoimmunity is characterized by 'immunosenescence.' Which of the following is a hallmark of this process?",
            "options": [
                "Increased production of naive T-cells from the thymus",
                "A decrease in systemic inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha)",
                "The expansion of highly differentiated memory T-cells and a decrease in naive T-cells",
                "An increase in the diversity of the B-cell repertoire"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Immunosenescence involves thymic involution, leading to fewer naive T-cells and an accumulation of 'exhausted' memory T-cells, contributing to both poor infection response and increased autoimmunity (inflamm-aging)."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "In managing a client with suspected biofilm-related plateaus, which 'Stage 2' disruptor is specifically utilized for its ability to break down the heavy metal bonds (iron, calcium, magnesium) holding the biofilm together?",
            "options": [
                "Standard Oregano Oil",
                "Bismuth-thiol complexes",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bismuth-thiol complexes (like Paul Anderson's formulation) are potent 'Stage 2' biofilm disruptors that penetrate the EPS by binding to the minerals that stabilize the biofilm structure."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client with Multiple Autoimmune Syndrome (MAS) is more likely to have a 'cluster' of diseases. If they have Vitiligo and Grave's Disease, they are statistically at a much higher risk for which third condition?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitiligo, Grave's Disease, and Pernicious Anemia form a common autoimmune cluster (often associated with MAS Type 3), likely due to shared genetic susceptibilities in the AIRE gene or HLA regions."
