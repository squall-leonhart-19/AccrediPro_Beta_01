            "question": "When analyzing Advanced Biomarkers (L1), what is the primary difference between a 'Pathological' range and a 'Functional' range?",
            "options": [
                "Pathological ranges are based on the top 5% of the healthy population.",
                "Functional ranges are narrower and intended to identify physiological dysfunction before the onset of clinical disease.",
                "Pathological ranges are used by nutritionists, while functional ranges are used by surgeons.",
                "Functional ranges are based on the average of the laboratory's specific patient population (Standard Deviation of 2)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges are tighter, evidence-based intervals that represent optimal physiological function, whereas pathological (standard) ranges are typically calculated using a bell curve of the local population, which often includes many individuals with sub-clinical illness."

            "options": [
                "Communication: Building rapport with the client.",
                "Caloric Density: Ensuring the client is eating enough macronutrients.",

                "Cellular Integrity: Focusing on mitochondrial repair before any other intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "C stands for Clinical Triage. This phase focuses on identifying 'deal-breakers' like environmental toxins, active infections, or major dietary triggers to lower the systemic inflammatory load before moving to deeper repair work."

            "question": "Regarding Gut-Immune Barrier Assessment (L3), which marker is considered the most specific indicator of 'leaky gut' due to its role in modulating tight junction patency?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the wall of the digestive tract. High levels are a validated biomarker for increased intestinal permeability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and others has shown that infants are born with a 'body burden' of over 200 chemicals, emphasizing that environmental load begins even before birth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign antigen (like an EBV protein) with a self-antigen (like myelin or thyroid tissue) due to structural similarities, leading to cross-reactive autoimmunity."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In Neuro-Endocrine Assessment (L6), a 'blunted' or flat Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is often associated with which clinical state?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat CAR indicates that the HPA axis has lost its dynamic flexibility, often seen in chronic fatigue, long-term autoimmune conditions, and systemic inflammation where the body can no longer mount an appropriate morning cortisol rise."

            "options": [
                "1% carry it; if you have it, you definitely have Celiac.",
                "90% carry it; it is a useless marker.",
                "30-40% carry it, but only 3% of those carriers develop Celiac, highlighting the role of epigenetic triggers.",
                "50% carry it; it only causes Celiac if the person also has a Vitamin D deficiency."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are necessary for Celiac disease, they are not sufficient. The high prevalence in the population vs. the low disease rate proves that genes 'load the gun' but environment 'pulls the trigger.'"

            "question": "According to Monitoring Remission (L8), what is the 'Functional' target for High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in a client seeking to maintain remission?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While standard labs often flag CRP only above 3.0 or 5.0 mg/L, the functional target for quiescent autoimmune disease and cardiovascular health is consistently < 1.0 mg/L."

            "question": "Case Study Application: A client with Rheumatoid Arthritis shows high levels of Urinary Mycotoxins (L4) and a 'leaky gut' profile (L3). According to the C.A.L.M. framework, what is the most logical first step?",

                "Start an intensive exercise program to sweat out the toxins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under the C.A.L.M. framework, 'Clearance' of the external trigger (mold) must happen first. Attempting to repair the gut while the client is still being poisoned by mycotoxins is often ineffective."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MSQ is a foundational functional medicine tool that quantifies symptoms across 15+ systems, allowing practitioners to track the 'Total Symptom Score' over time to monitor progress and remission."
