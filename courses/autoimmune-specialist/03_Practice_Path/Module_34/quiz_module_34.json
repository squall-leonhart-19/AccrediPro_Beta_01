            "question": "In the context of the Psychology of Group Dynamics (L1), what is the primary risk associated with 'Co-rumination' in autoimmune support groups?",
            "options": [
                "Increased adherence to anti-inflammatory protocols",
                "Exacerbation of the nocebo effect and increased perceived symptom severity",
                "Spontaneous clinical remission through social bonding",
                "Reduced cortisol levels due to shared experience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-rumination involves excessive discussion of personal problems and negative feelings within a group, which can lead to a 'symptom contagion' or nocebo effect, where participants perceive their own symptoms as more severe based on others' reports."

        {
            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing pedagogical materials for autoimmune workshops (L2), which 'Cognitive Load' strategy is most effective for clients experiencing 'brain fog'?",
            "options": [
                "Massed practice sessions of 3-4 hours to ensure immersion",

                "Utilizing high-contrast, text-heavy slides to ensure technical accuracy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune clients often suffer from cognitive fatigue; segmenting content into micro-learning bursts (15-20 minutes) helps manage the limited cognitive resources available during flare-ups."

        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A participant in your group program frequently interrupts others to discuss their specific, complex lab results. According to Facilitation Mastery (L3), what is the best intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Mute the participant immediately and continue the lecture",
                "Address the behavior using the 'Parking Lot' technique to protect group time while acknowledging the individual",
                "Spend 20 minutes analyzing their labs to show your expertise to the group",
                "Ask the group to vote on whether they want to hear more about those labs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Parking Lot' technique allows the facilitator to acknowledge the participant's specific needs without derailing the group's collective progress, scheduling a separate time or 1-on-1 to address the individual complexity."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When scaling the C.A.L.M. Protocol for cohort-based delivery (L4), how should the 'A' (Assessment) phase be modified for a group of 20 clients?",
            "options": [
                "Assessments should be skipped to save time",
                "Perform 60-minute individual intakes for every member during group hours",
                "Utilize automated digital symptom trackers (like MSQ) and aggregate data to identify group-wide trends",
                "Ask members to self-diagnose based on a provided PDF checklist"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires moving from manual to automated/digital assessment tools. Aggregating data allows the facilitator to tailor the cohort's curriculum to the most prevalent symptoms (e.g., fatigue vs. joint pain) identified in the intake."

                "50% group and 50% 1-on-1 for every participant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 hybrid model leverages the scalability of group education (80%) while providing high-value, individualized 'Laser Sessions' (20%) to address specific bio-individual roadblocks."

                "Obtaining signed 'Informed Consent for Group Recording' that specifies who has access to the footage",
                "Only recording the coach and never the participants' faces",
                "Recording is not allowed under any circumstances due to HIPAA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While group recordings are allowed, they require specific informed consent that outlines privacy boundaries, storage protocols, and the restricted nature of who can view the content (usually only the cohort members)."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in Lesson 7 demonstrated that group-based lifestyle interventions for RA patients resulted in what average reduction in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) scores?",

                "90% total elimination of fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data consistently shows that group-based interventions for autoimmune conditions like RA and Lupus yield a 25-35% reduction in fatigue scores, largely due to the combination of lifestyle education and social support."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "When marketing an autoimmune group program (L8), which statement adheres to the AccrediPro Ethical Marketing Guidelines?",

                "'I guarantee a 100% remission rate for all participants.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing for L4 Specialists avoids 'cure' or 'guarantee' claims, instead focusing on evidence-based outcomes like inflammation reduction, symptom management, and quality of life improvements."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "What is the 'Social Loafing' threshold identified in Lesson 1, where individual engagement typically begins to drop in a virtual autoimmune group?",
            "options": [
                "Groups larger than 5 members",
                "Groups larger than 15-20 members",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In virtual cohorts, once a group exceeds 15-20 members, the 'bystander effect' or social loafing increases, where individuals feel less personal responsibility to participate or engage with the material."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "In the L4 methodology, 'Clinical ROI' (L7) is best measured by which combination of factors?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical ROI for an Autoimmune Specialist goes beyond financial profit; it includes the objective improvement in client health (outcomes), their continued participation (retention), and their willingness to recommend the program (referrals)."
