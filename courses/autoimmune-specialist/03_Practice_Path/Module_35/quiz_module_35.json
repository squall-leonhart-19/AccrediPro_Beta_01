            "explanation": "To scale, the CEO must shift away from 'doing' the work (clinical) to 'leading' the vision and operations. A 2022 study on micro-business scaling found that founders who spent >60% of their time on strategy grew 2.4x faster than those focused on operations."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Tripwire is designed to change the relationship from 'lead' to 'customer' quickly. Data shows that a customer who has made a small purchase is 10 times more likely to buy a high-ticket program than a non-buyer."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Practitioner Trap' occurs when clinical experts spend 30-40% of their time on scheduling and billing. Hiring an Operations Manager or VA allows the CEO to focus on high-value revenue-generating activities."
