            "id": "q30_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Strategic Niche Mastery,' why is a 'hyper-niche' (e.g., Hashimoto's for postpartum women) considered more profitable than a general autoimmune practice?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the total number of potential clients to a manageable level.",
                "It allows for higher authority positioning and specific marketing resonance that lowers acquisition costs.",
                "It requires less scientific knowledge because the scope is narrower.",
                "It is the only way to legally practice without a medical license."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-niching creates 'Expert Status.' When marketing speaks to a specific pain point (like postpartum Hashimoto's), the perceived value of the solution increases, allowing for premium pricing and more effective marketing spend."

        {
            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Legal Frameworks, what is the primary purpose of a 'Scope of Practice' boundary for an Autoimmune Specialist?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the practitioner from ever suggesting dietary changes.",
                "To ensure the practitioner can legally prescribe low-dose naltrexone (LDN).",
                "To clearly distinguish health coaching/consulting from the practice of medicine to avoid liability.",
                "To limit the number of clients a practitioner can see per month."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Scope of Practice document protects the practitioner by ensuring they do not diagnose, treat, or cure disease, but rather provide education and lifestyle support, which is critical for legal safety in the autoimmune space."

            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "In the CALM Methodology™ Framework (Lesson 3), what does the 'A' represent in the context of high-ticket program design?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the CALM Methodology™, 'A' stands for Assessment. This involves the deep-dive analysis of the client's unique triggers, labs, and history to move beyond a 'one-size-fits-all' protocol."

        {
            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Authority Positioning.' Based on the 'Rule of 7,' why is a multi-channel content strategy necessary for chronic sufferers?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic sufferers are often skeptical due to past failures and require 7-12 touchpoints to build trust.",
                "It is a requirement for SEO ranking on Google.",
                "It ensures that if one social media platform closes, the practice survives.",
                "Most clients will only buy after seeing 7 different advertisements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune clients have often been 'burned' by the medical system or failed supplements. They require more touchpoints (7-12) to establish the safety and trust needed to invest in a high-ticket program."

            "id": "q30_5",

            "options": [
                "Offer a 50% discount if they sign up right now.",
                "Tell them the offer is no longer available if they hang up.",
                "Acknowledge the need for reflection but ask, 'What specifically do you need to find clarity on to make this decision?'",
                "Immediately end the call as they are not a 'committed client.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Professional enrollment is about coaching the client through their fear. Asking what they need clarity on helps identify if the objection is about money, spouse support, or a lack of belief in the process."

            "id": "q30_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 emphasizes 'Operational Excellence.' Which automation is cited as having the highest impact on client retention and compliance?",

                "Automated lead generation through Facebook ads."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Automated check-ins ensure that clients feel supported even when the practitioner isn't physically present, significantly increasing compliance and long-term success rates."

            "id": "q30_7",
            "question": "When building a 'Referral Ecosystem' (Lesson 7), why should you target Co-Managing practitioners rather than just asking for 'leads'?",
            "options": [
                "Co-management allows you to charge the other doctor a commission.",
                "It positions you as a peer who provides lifestyle support that improves the doctor's clinical outcomes.",
                "It is legally required in most states to have a co-managing physician.",
                "It allows you to use the doctor's office for your own consultations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Doctors are more likely to refer when they see you as a partner who helps their patients get better results (e.g., through diet/stress management) which the doctor doesn't have time to implement."

        {
            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8 on Scaling, what is the 'Practitioner Burnout Threshold' typically seen in 1-on-1 autoimmune consulting?",
            "options": [
                "5 clients",
                "15-22 active high-intensity clients",
                "50-60 active high-intensity clients",
                "There is no threshold if you use automation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to the emotional and cognitive load of complex autoimmune cases, most solo practitioners hit a 'burnout wall' at 15-22 active 1-on-1 clients, necessitating a move to group models or hiring associate coaches."
        },
        {
            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 3 showed that moving from a 'pay-per-session' model to a '90-day CALM Program' increased client success rates by 64%. Why?",
            "options": [
                "The program was more expensive, so clients felt more guilt.",
                "The 90-day commitment ensures the client stays through the 'healing crisis' phase where many usually quit.",
                "The practitioner had more money to spend on better supplements for the client.",
                "90 days is the exact time it takes for all autoimmune diseases to go into remission."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune recovery is non-linear. Package-based models prevent 'premature quitting' during the difficult middle phase of lifestyle changes, leading to better clinical outcomes."

            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Advanced Marketing,' what is the primary goal of an 'Authority Lead Magnet' (ALM)?",
            "options": [
                "To get as many email addresses as possible, regardless of quality.",
                "To provide a quick fix that cures the client's symptoms in 24 hours.",
                "To demonstrate a 'Small Win' and shift the client's perspective on why their previous efforts failed.",
                "To sell a low-cost $7 supplement ebook."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An effective ALM for autoimmune sufferers must provide a 'Small Win' (e.g., reducing bloat or improving sleep) to prove your methodology works and build the necessary authority for a high-ticket conversion."
