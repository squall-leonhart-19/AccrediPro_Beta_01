            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system communicates with the immune system primarily via the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals in lymphoid organs, which binds to adrenergic receptors on immune cells."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The X-chromosome contains many immune-related genes; incomplete X-inactivation allows for the overexpression of these genes in females, increasing susceptibility to autoimmunity."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve releases acetylcholine which binds to the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on macrophages, signaling the cell to stop producing pro-inflammatory cytokines."
