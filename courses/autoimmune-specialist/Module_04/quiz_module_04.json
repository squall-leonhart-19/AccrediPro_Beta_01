        {
            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which physiological protein is the only known modulator of intercellular tight junctions that can be triggered by gluten (gliadin) and dysbiosis?",
            "options": ["Occludin", "Zonulin", "Claudin-1", "Vinculin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability and are often triggered by gliadin exposure and bacterial overgrowth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are potent drivers of systemic inflammation. To which specific receptor do they bind to initiate the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway?",
            "options": ["TLR2", "NOD2", "TLR4", "ACE2"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria bind to Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering a cascade that leads to systemic cytokine production and chronic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis highlighted the role of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Which SCFA is primarily responsible for inducing T-regulatory (Treg) cells and maintaining the colonic mucosal barrier?",
            "options": ["Butyrate", "Acetate", "Propionate", "Valerate"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred energy source for colonocytes and plays a critical role in immune homeostasis by inducing the differentiation of T-regulatory cells, which suppress autoimmunity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which oral pathogen is specifically implicated in the pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) due to its ability to produce the PAD enzyme, leading to 'citrullination' of proteins?",
            "options": ["Streptococcus mutans", "Porphyromonas gingivalis", "Candida albicans", "Fusobacterium nucleatum"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "P. gingivalis produces peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD), which converts arginine into citrulline. This process of citrullination creates neoantigens that the immune system attacks in RA."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'Leaky Gut, Leaky Brain,' which tight junction protein is considered the most critical for maintaining the integrity of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)?",
            "options": ["Claudin-1", "Claudin-2", "Claudin-5", "Zonulin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Claudin-5 is the most enriched tight junction protein in the BBB. Its degradation, often mirrored by intestinal barrier failure, allows neurotoxins and immune cells to enter the CNS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "When designing a mucosal healing protocol, which nutrient is uniquely effective because it remains in the gastric/intestinal mucosa for an extended period due to its slow dissociation rate?",
            "options": ["L-Glutamine", "Zinc Carnosine", "Quercetin", "Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice (DGL)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zinc Carnosine (Polaprezinc) is a chelated compound that adheres to mucosal erosions and dissociates slowly, providing superior tissue repair compared to standard zinc or carnosine alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is a frequent driver of barrier failure. What is the primary physiological mechanism that prevents SIBO by clearing debris and bacteria from the small intestine during fasting?",
            "options": ["The Migrating Motor Complex (MMC)", "Peristalsis", "Segmentation", "Gastric Acid Secretion"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MMC is the 'housekeeping' wave of the digestive tract. Failure of the MMC (often due to anti-vinculin antibodies) is a primary root cause of SIBO and subsequent mucosal damage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Research on 'metabolic endotoxemia' shows that a single high-fat, highly processed meal can increase serum LPS levels by how much in healthy individuals?",
            "options": ["10-15%", "25-30%", "2-3 fold", "10 fold"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that high-fat, calorie-dense meals can cause a 2-3 fold increase in serum LPS (metabolic endotoxemia) within 1-4 hours, promoting transient systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's presents with bloating, high anti-TPO antibodies, and elevated fecal zonulin. According to the 5R framework, what is the most logical first step?",
            "options": ["Repairing the lining with high-dose L-Glutamine", "Removing triggers (e.g., gluten, pathogens, or SIBO)", "Reinnoculating with high-dose probiotics", "Replacing digestive enzymes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the 5R framework, 'Remove' comes first. You must remove the triggers (pathogens, inflammatory foods) before the 'Repair' phase can be effective, otherwise, the 'leaky' stimulus remains."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which amino acid serves as the primary fuel source for enterocytes and is required at higher concentrations (up to 5-10g daily) during periods of mucosal 'stress' or repair?",
            "options": ["L-Arginine", "L-Threonine", "L-Glutamine", "L-Lysine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body and the primary fuel source for the rapidly dividing cells of the intestinal lining, making it essential for repairing tight junctions."
