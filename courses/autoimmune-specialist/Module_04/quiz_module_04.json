            "question": "In the context of autoimmune health, how is 'Clinical Remission' distinguished from 'Symptomatic Remission'?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical remission requires the total absence of any symptoms for 12 months.",
                "Clinical remission involves the normalization of inflammatory biomarkers and imaging, regardless of minor subjective symptoms.",
                "Symptomatic remission is only achieved when the client no longer requires any medication.",
                "There is no clinical difference; the terms are used interchangeably in functional medicine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical remission is defined by objective data (biomarkers, labs, imaging) showing no active disease, whereas symptomatic remission refers to the client's subjective experience of being symptom-free."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "When monitoring for long-term stability, a significant rise in which non-specific biomarkers often precedes a clinical flare-up?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c and LDL Cholesterol",
                "Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)",
                "Vitamin D3 and Magnesium levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CRP and ESR are acute-phase reactants; while non-specific, their elevation often signals an increase in systemic inflammation before physical symptoms manifest."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the Strategic Reintroduction protocol (AIP), how long should a client wait after testing a small amount of a 'Stage 1' food before introducing it in a larger quantity?",
            "options": [
                "24 hours",
                "72 hours",
                "1 week",
                "1 month"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 72-hour rule (3 days) is critical because delayed hypersensitivity reactions (IgG mediated or T-cell mediated) can take up to three days to manifest symptoms."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which metric is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing the resilience of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) and the client's ability to maintain immune homeostasis?",
            "options": [
                "Resting Heart Rate (RHR)",

                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)",
                "Respiratory Rate (RR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indicates robust parasympathetic tone and a more resilient nervous system, which is essential for preventing immune dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client in remission wants to optimize their 'Total Toxic Burden.' Which class of chemicals, found in plastics and fragrances, is specifically known to disrupt the Th17/Treg balance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) like phthalates and BPA can promote Th17 pro-inflammatory activity and suppress regulatory T-cell (Treg) function."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "For a client in the maintenance phase, which exercise intensity is generally recommended to support mitochondrial health without triggering an inflammatory cortisol spike?",
            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) 5 days a week",
                "Zone 2 Aerobic Training (60-70% Max HR)",
                "Maximum effort Powerlifting",
                "Sedentary lifestyle with no exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training improves mitochondrial density and metabolic flexibility without the excessive allostatic load associated with chronic high-intensity exercise."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4R Flare Protocol emphasizes: Rest (sleep), Reduce (stress/activity), Remove (potential triggers), and Repair (targeted nutrient support)."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Practitioner-Client Partnership' during the maintenance phase?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client remains dependent on the practitioner for all health decisions.",
                "To transition the client toward self-efficacy and internal locus of control.",
                "To sell as many supplements as possible to prevent a flare.",
                "To perform weekly blood tests to catch every minor fluctuation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In maintenance, the practitioner's role shifts to a coach/mentor, empowering the client with the tools and confidence to manage their own health (self-efficacy)."

            "options": [
                "Continue eating the food to build tolerance.",
                "Immediately start a 3-day water fast.",
                "Return to the baseline AIP diet until symptoms resolve, then re-test later.",
                "Permanently ban that food for life."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Minor reactions indicate the immune system is not yet ready for that food. The protocol is to return to the safe baseline until symptoms clear before attempting a different food."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study on 'Allostatic Load' in autoimmune patients suggested that chronic physiological stress accounts for what percentage of flare-up triggers?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 15-20%",

                "Stress has not been scientifically linked to flares."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that high allostatic load (the 'wear and tear' on the body from chronic stress) is a primary driver in 60-80% of autoimmune flare-ups."
