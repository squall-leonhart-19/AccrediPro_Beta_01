      "letter": "A",
      "meaning": "Antigen Mapping",
      "description": "Systematically identifying the specific environmental, dietary, and microbial triggers that initiate molecular mimicry and the autoimmune cascade. This step focuses on uncovering the 'why' behind the immune system's loss of self-tolerance."

      "letter": "R",
      "meaning": "Regulatory Modulation",
      "description": "Implementing protocols designed to upregulate T-regulatory (Treg) cells and balance the Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine pathways. This restores the body's natural ability to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self' tissue."

      "letter": "M",
      "meaning": "Mucosal Integrity",
      "description": "Repairing the intestinal and systemic barriers to prevent the translocation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and undigested proteins into the bloodstream. Strengthening these 'gates' is essential for reducing chronic systemic inflammation."

      "letter": "O",
      "meaning": "Oxidative Stress Mitigation",
      "description": "Utilizing targeted antioxidants and mitochondrial support to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause secondary tissue damage. This protects healthy organs from the 'friendly fire' of a hyper-active immune response."

      "letter": "R",
      "meaning": "Remission Maintenance",
      "description": "Establishing a long-term, adaptive lifestyle framework to sustain low disease activity and prevent future flares. This phase focuses on psychological resilience, circadian alignment, and ongoing biomarkers monitoring."
