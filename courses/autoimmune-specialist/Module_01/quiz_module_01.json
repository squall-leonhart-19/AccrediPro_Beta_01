            "question": "In the pathophysiology of autoimmune inflammation, what is the primary consequence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation?",
            "options": [
                "The production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 to balance the immune response",
                "The maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18",
                "The immediate apoptosis of autoreactive T-cells",
                "The upregulation of the Vagus nerve to suppress splenic output"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of the innate immune system that, when activated, triggers the maturation of highly inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18, driving the 'inflammatory fire' in autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client's lab results show an hs-CRP of 4.8 mg/L. Based on the Clinical Biomarkers lesson, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal range; no systemic inflammation detected",
                "Low-grade inflammation; typical of lifestyle stress only",
                "High risk; indicates significant systemic inflammatory activity",
                "Critical emergency; requires immediate hospitalization for sepsis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional immunology, an hs-CRP above 3.0 mg/L is considered high risk for systemic inflammation and cardiovascular events. A value of 4.8 mg/L indicates a significant inflammatory load that requires containment."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry is a key mechanism in dietary triggers. Which protein is specifically noted for its structural similarity to thyroid peroxidase (TPO), potentially triggering Hashimoto’s?",
            "options": [
                "Casein",
                "Zein",
                "Gliadin",
                "Ovalbumin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gliadin (a component of gluten) has molecular sequences that mimic thyroid tissue. In susceptible individuals, the immune response against gliadin can cross-react with the thyroid gland via molecular mimicry."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "How do xenobiotics like Bisphenol A (BPA) contribute to the 'Inflammatory Load'?",
            "options": [
                "By acting as haptens that bind to self-proteins, making them appear 'foreign' to the immune system",
                "By increasing the production of secretory IgA in the gut",
                "By neutralizing Th17 cells and promoting Treg dominance",
                "By accelerating the clearance of heavy metals from the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Xenobiotics often act as haptens—small molecules that attach to larger self-proteins. This complex creates a 'neo-antigen' which the immune system no longer recognizes as 'self,' triggering an autoimmune attack."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the Neuro-Endocrine-Immune loop, what is the result of 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Resistance' caused by chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol becomes too effective, leading to total immune suppression",
                "The immune system stops responding to cortisol's 'stop' signal, leading to unchecked inflammation",
                "The adrenal glands stop producing cortisol entirely (Addisonian crisis)",
                "The Vagus nerve increases its acetylcholine output to compensate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to the downregulation or desensitization of glucocorticoid receptors. Even if cortisol is high, the immune cells cannot 'hear' the signal to stop producing cytokines, resulting in persistent inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When using the Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) for an Inflammatory Load Assessment, what score threshold typically indicates a 'Severe' systemic load?",
            "options": [
                "Score > 20",
                "Score > 50",
                "Score > 100",
                "Score > 250"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While any score increase is relevant, an MSQ score exceeding 100 is clinically significant for a high systemic inflammatory load, suggesting multiple systems (integumentary, digestive, neurological) are affected."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Which 'Fire Extinguisher' strategy is most effective at inhibiting the NF-kB (Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C at 500mg daily",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin is one of the most researched natural NF-kB inhibitors. By blocking this master genetic switch for inflammation, it reduces the transcription of various pro-inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "According to the 2023 meta-analysis (n=8,234) cited in Lesson 7, high-dose Omega-3 supplementation (EPA/DHA) demonstrated what effect on C-Reactive Protein (CRP)?",
            "options": [
                "No significant change compared to placebo",
                "A reduction in CRP levels by an average of 18-22%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The specific meta-analysis highlighted that consistent, high-dose Omega-3 intake resulted in a statistically significant reduction of 18-22% in systemic CRP levels over the study periods."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'C' (Contain) phase before moving to the 'A' (Address) phase in the AccrediPro methodology?",
            "options": [
                "To identify the root cause of the disease",
                "To perform deep heavy metal chelation",
                "To lower the 'inflammatory fire' and stabilize the client to prevent further tissue damage",
                "To reintroduce all excluded foods to test for reactions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Contain' phase is about 'putting out the fire.' You cannot perform deep investigative or detox work (Address phase) while the client is in an acute inflammatory flare, as it may exacerbate their condition."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A 42-year-old female with Lupus (SLE) presents with joint pain, malar rash, and high anti-dsDNA antibodies. Her 'Total Load' assessment reveals high mold exposure, high sugar intake, and poor sleep. What is the priority transition strategy from 'C' to 'A'?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately start a 21-day water fast to reset the immune system",
                "Prescribe high-dose Vitamin D without checking blood levels",
                "Contain inflammation with polyphenols and diet, then gradually address the mold and lifestyle triggers once markers stabilize",
                "Ignore the dietary triggers and focus solely on the xenobiotic (mold) removal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The correct clinical sequence is to contain the immediate inflammation (polyphenols/diet) to provide symptomatic relief and prevent tissue damage, then move to addressing the 'Total Load' (mold/lifestyle) once the client is stable."
