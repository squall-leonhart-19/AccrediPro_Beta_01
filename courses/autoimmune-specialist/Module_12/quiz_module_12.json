            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the context of the Neuro-Endocrine-Immune (NEI) super-system, what is the primary mechanism behind 'Glucocorticoid Resistance' (GCR) in chronic autoimmune patients?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands stop producing cortisol entirely (Addisonian crisis).",
                "The downregulation or reduced binding affinity of the Glucocorticoid Receptor alpha (GR-α).",
                "An over-expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor leading to sodium retention.",
                "The rapid conversion of cortisol to cortisone by the 11β-HSD2 enzyme."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucocorticoid Resistance occurs when immune cells become less sensitive to the anti-inflammatory effects of cortisol, often due to chronic overexposure which leads to the downregulation or phosphorylation of GR-α receptors."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "The 'Cholinergic Anti-Inflammatory Pathway' (CAP) involves the Vagus nerve communicating with the immune system. Which specific receptor on splenic macrophages is responsible for inhibiting TNF-alpha release?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-2 Adrenergic Receptor",
                "Muscarinic M1 Receptor",

                "Glutamate NMDA Receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The α7nAChR is the critical molecular link in the CAP; when acetylcholine binds to this receptor on macrophages, it inhibits the translocation of NF-κB, thereby reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Research into the 'Autoimmune Gender Gap' indicates that Estrogen (specifically Estradiol/E2) has a dose-dependent effect on the immune system. At physiological levels, how does E2 typically influence B-cell activity?",
            "options": [
                "It induces B-cell apoptosis to prevent autoimmunity.",
                "It promotes B-cell survival, maturation, and the production of autoantibodies.",
                "It has no measurable effect on B-cells, only on T-cell polarization.",
                "It shifts B-cells exclusively into a regulatory (Breg) phenotype."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol enhances B-cell survival and promotes the transition from immature to mature B-cells, which contributes to the higher prevalence of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases in biological females."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with 'Brain Fog,' fatigue, and cognitive slowing. According to Lesson 7 on Neuroinflammation, which 'phenotype' are the microglia likely exhibiting in this state?",

                "M3 Regulatory State"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The M1 phenotype is the 'primed' or activated state where microglia release neurotoxic cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), leading to the synaptic pruning and metabolic shifts associated with 'Brain Fog'."

                "A shift toward Th17 dominance and a reduction in the suppressive capacity of Tregs."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is a potent immunomodulator; its suppression disrupts the circadian rhythm of immune surveillance, typically leading to an increase in pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and a decrease in Treg function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Graves' Disease involves Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI) that bind to and activate the TSH receptor, mimicking the action of TSH and causing excessive thyroid hormone production."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In the clinical protocol for NEI rebalancing, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is used as a primary biomarker. A consistently 'Low' HRV (specifically low SDNN or rMSSD) suggests:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low HRV is a clinical indicator of Sympathetic dominance and reduced Vagal tone, reflecting a 'locked' stress response and impaired ability of the NEI axis to regulate inflammation."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "According to the statistics cited in Lesson 2, what percentage of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) demonstrate measurable Glucocorticoid Resistance despite high-dose therapy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (as cited in the module) suggest that roughly 30-40% of SLE patients exhibit some form of glucocorticoid resistance, necessitating the use of steroid-sparing agents or NEI-sensitizing protocols."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under conditions of chronic inflammation (high IFN-γ), the Kynurenine pathway shifts toward the production of Quinolinic Acid (QUIN), an NMDA receptor agonist that is neurotoxic and contributes to neurodegeneration."
