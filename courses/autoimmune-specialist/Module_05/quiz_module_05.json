            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "In the context of Lesson 1, how is 'Clinical Remission' specifically distinguished from 'Asymptomatic Status' in an autoimmune client?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical Remission requires only the absence of physical symptoms for at least 3 months.",
                "Clinical Remission requires both the absence of clinical symptoms and the normalization of objective inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., hs-CRP < 1.0 mg/L).",
                "Asymptomatic status is considered superior to remission because it implies the disease has been cured.",
                "Clinical Remission is defined solely by the reduction of medication dosage by 50%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical remission is a dual-metric state requiring both the subjective absence of symptoms and the objective normalization of inflammatory markers to ensure underlying tissue damage has ceased."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Advanced Monitoring, which biomarker is considered the 'gold standard' for detecting subclinical systemic inflammation during the maintenance phase?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Hemoglobin A1c",
                "High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "Serum Calcium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is the most sensitive marker for systemic inflammation in autoimmune maintenance, with levels below 1.0 mg/L indicating low risk and levels above 3.0 mg/L suggesting an active inflammatory process or impending flare."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "When moving through the Reintroduction Phase (Lesson 3), what is the recommended 'wait period' after testing a small amount of a Stage 1 food before proceeding to a full serving?",
            "options": [
                "2 hours",
                "24 to 72 hours",
                "7 days",
                "15 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Delayed hypersensitivity reactions (Type IV) can take up to 3 days to manifest. Therefore, a 24-72 hour observation period is mandatory to ensure no late-stage inflammatory response occurs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'prodromal' symptoms including sudden fatigue and 'brain fog.' According to Lesson 4, which 'Rescue Protocol' dosage is supported by the 2022 meta-analysis cited for acute inflammation management?",
            "options": [
                "500mg of Vitamin C once weekly",
                "1,000–1,500mg of bioavailable Curcuminoids daily in divided doses",
                "Eliminating all fats from the diet for 48 hours",
                "Increasing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to 'sweat out' the flare"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-dose curcumin (1,000-1,500mg) has been shown in meta-analyses to downregulate NF-kB signaling and can serve as a potent natural intervention during the early stages of a flare."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses Phase II Detoxification. Which specific process is responsible for neutralizing reactive intermediates by attaching a sulfur group, and which nutrient is the primary donor?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylation; Vitamin B12",
                "Sulfation; MSM or cysteine-rich proteins",
                "Glucuronidation; Glucose",
                "Methylation; Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulfation is a key Phase II pathway that requires sulfur donors like MSM, cysteine, or methionine to neutralize toxins, particularly steroid hormones and environmental phenols."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is introduced as a tool for measuring psychological resilience. What does a consistent *decrease* in a client’s baseline HRV typically signify?",
            "options": [
                "Improved parasympathetic 'rest and digest' activity",
                "Increased physiological stress and a shift toward sympathetic dominance",
                "A successful adaptation to the AIP diet",
                "That the client is getting too much sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A lower HRV indicates reduced autonomic flexibility and higher sympathetic (fight-or-flight) tone, which often precedes an autoimmune flare by 24-48 hours."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 7, what is the 'Circadian Anchor' recommended to regulate the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in autoimmune patients?",
            "options": [
                "Drinking 16oz of cold water at 10:00 PM",
                "Exposure to 10,000 lux of full-spectrum light (sunlight) within 30 minutes of waking",
                "Performing heavy weightlifting sessions after 8:00 PM",
                "Consuming a high-protein snack exactly at midnight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Morning light exposure triggers the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to regulate the cortisol awakening response, which is essential for modulating the immune system's daily rhythm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 describes the 'Practitioner’s Role.' What is the primary benefit of the 'T-Shaped' practitioner model in autoimmune care?",
            "options": [
                "It encourages the practitioner to ignore conventional medical advice.",
                "It combines deep specialized knowledge in one area with the ability to collaborate across multiple disciplines (e.g., GI, Rheumatology, Nutrition).",
                "It focuses exclusively on 'T-cell' counts as the only metric of success.",
                "It requires the practitioner to take over the role of the primary care physician."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The T-shaped model emphasizes deep expertise in autoimmune health (the vertical bar) and the ability to collaborate with a broader medical team (the horizontal bar) for holistic client safety."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Maria is reintroducing Stage 2 foods (e.g., almonds). She feels fine on Day 1, but on Day 3 she develops a mild skin rash. What is the correct protocol according to the course methodology?",
            "options": [
                "Continue eating almonds to see if the body 'adapts' to the allergen.",
                "Immediately stop almonds, return to the strict elimination phase until the rash clears, and wait at least 3-7 days before testing a different food.",
                "Switch to almond butter instead of whole almonds to see if the texture was the issue.",
                "Take an antihistamine and move immediately to Stage 3 reintroductions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Any reaction, even delayed, indicates a failure of that specific reintroduction. The client must return to the 'safe' baseline to allow the immune system to calm down before attempting a new food."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "According to the statistics provided in Lesson 4, approximately what percentage of autoimmune patients experience at least one flare per year despite high dietary adherence?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5%",
                "Approximately 15-20%",
                "Over 60-70%",
                "0% (Flares are impossible on strict AIP)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data suggests that 60-70% of patients experience flares due to non-dietary triggers like sleep deprivation, emotional stress, or environmental toxins, highlighting the need for a multi-faceted maintenance plan."
