            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) contribute to 'epitope spreading' in autoimmune disease?",
            "options": [
                "Direct destruction of regulatory T-cells in the thymus",
                "Modification of self-proteins into neoantigens that the immune system no longer recognizes as 'self'",

                "Reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the extracellular matrix"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ROS can oxidatively modify native proteins, changing their structure into 'neoantigens.' This causes the immune system to attack these modified proteins and eventually spread its attack to the original, unmodified tissue (epitope spreading)."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which mitochondrial component is the primary chromophore target of Photobiomodulation (Red Light Therapy) in the 600-1000nm range?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cytochrome c Oxidase is the primary photo-acceptor in the mitochondria. When it absorbs red and near-infrared light, it displaces inhibitory nitric oxide, leading to increased oxygen consumption and ATP production."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GGT is the enzyme responsible for breaking down extracellular glutathione so its amino acids can be brought into the cell. High levels often reflect a compensatory response to low intracellular glutathione levels."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While CoQ10 improves the efficiency of existing mitochondria, PQQ has been shown to stimulate the signaling pathways (like PGC-1alpha) that lead to the creation of entirely new mitochondria."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NADPH Oxidase (NOX) enzymes are specifically designed to produce superoxide radicals during an immune response to destroy pathogens; however, in chronic autoimmunity, this 'fire' can become systemic."
