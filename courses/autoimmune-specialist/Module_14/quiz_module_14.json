            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which specific protein, often associated with intestinal permeability, is also a primary regulator of Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) tight junction integrity and is elevated in 'Leaky Brain' scenarios?",
            "options": [
                "Zonulin",
                "Occludin-2",
                "Calprotectin",
                "Lactoferrin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin modulates the permeability of tight junctions in both the digestive tract and the Blood-Brain Barrier. High levels of circulating zonulin are associated with increased BBB permeability (Claudin-5 degradation)."

            "question": "In the context of microglial activation, what is the primary consequence of microglial 'priming' due to chronic systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "An immediate switch to the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Microglial priming occurs when chronic inflammation leaves these cells in a 'ready' state. Once primed, even a minor secondary systemic trigger can cause an exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxins."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "The Cholinergic Anti-Inflammatory Pathway (CAP) primarily utilizes which receptor on macrophages to inhibit the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HE is often referred to as SRECF (Steroid-Responsive Encephalopathy associated with autoimmune Thyroiditis) because its hallmark is a dramatic clinical improvement following the administration of steroids."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emerging research suggests Aβ is an antimicrobial peptide that the brain produces to trap invading pathogens (viruses, bacteria). Chronic infection leads to overproduction and the formation of pathological plaques."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Excessive glutamate (often released by activated microglia) overstimulates NMDA receptors. This allows a massive influx of calcium into the neuron, triggering oxidative stress and programmed cell death."
