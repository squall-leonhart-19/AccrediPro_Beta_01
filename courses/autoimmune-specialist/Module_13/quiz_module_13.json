            "question": "During the initial elimination phase of the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP), which of the following food groups must be strictly avoided due to its high content of glycoalkaloids, which may increase intestinal permeability?",
            "options": [
                "Nightshades (e.g., potatoes, tomatoes, peppers)",
                "Cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, kale)",
                "Fermented foods (e.g., sauerkraut, kefir)",
                "Omega-3 rich seafood (e.g., salmon, sardines)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nightshades contain glycoalkaloids like solanine and capsaicin, which have been shown in clinical models to disrupt the gut barrier and trigger inflammatory responses in sensitive autoimmune patients."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones is reacting to 'healthy' green smoothies. Which preparation technique is most effective for reducing oxalate content by up to 30-87%?",
            "options": [
                "Dehydrating the greens at low temperatures",
                "Boiling the greens and discarding the cooking water",
                "Fermenting the greens for 24 hours",
                "Blending the greens with high-fructose fruits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boiling significantly reduces soluble oxalates as they leach into the water. Discarding the water is essential, as steaming or raw consumption retains most of the oxalate content."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "In the context of Intermittent Fasting (IF), what is the primary mechanism by which autophagy benefits autoimmune clients?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells",
                "It promotes the accumulation of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy inhibition)",
                "It facilitates the degradation of dysfunctional cellular components and suppressed auto-antigen presentation",
                "It stimulates the mTOR pathway to increase protein synthesis in muscle tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autophagy allows the body to clear out 'cellular junk' and damaged organelles. In autoimmunity, this process helps reduce the burden of damaged proteins that can act as auto-antigens, while inhibiting mTOR to reduce systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Phase II detoxification involves the conjugation of toxins to make them water-soluble. Which pathway is specifically critical for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during Phase I and requires adequate sulfur-containing amino acids?",
            "options": [
                "Acetylation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Glutathione conjugation",
                "Methylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glutathione conjugation is a primary Phase II pathway that neutralizes electrophilic intermediates and ROS. It relies on glutathione, which is synthesized from cysteine, glycine, and glutamine."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "According to clinical data on botanical medicine, which herb has demonstrated the ability to inhibit the NF-kB pathway and reduce CRP levels by approximately 45% in inflammatory populations?",
            "options": [
                "Echinacea purpurea",
                "Curcumin (standardized with piperine)",
                "Valerian root",
                "St. John's Wort"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin is a potent modulator of the NF-kB transcription factor. Studies show its efficacy in lowering systemic inflammatory markers like CRP and ESR, making it a staple in autoimmune botanical protocols."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Sauna therapy (hyperthermia) induces the production of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). What is the therapeutic role of HSP70 in autoimmune recovery?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a molecular chaperone to ensure proper protein folding and prevents aggregation",
                "It triggers the immediate release of histamine from mast cells",
                "It decreases the heart rate variability (HRV) to induce stress",
                "It prevents the liver from processing Phase I metabolites"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "HSP70 helps refold misfolded proteins and protects cells from thermal and oxidative stress. This 'molecular chaperone' effect is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis in autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Melatonin is increasingly recognized as an immune modulator rather than just a sleep hormone. How does it specifically support the A.R.M.O.R. framework's 'Regulation' pillar?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the Th1/Th2 ratio to favor Th1 dominance",
                "By suppressing the production of Regulatory T-cells (Tregs)",
                "By upregulating antioxidant enzymes (Sod, GPx) and promoting Treg differentiation",
                "By stimulating the release of cortisol in the late evening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin enhances the antioxidant defense system and promotes the differentiation of Regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which are essential for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmune attacks."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "When a client is taking a conventional immunosuppressant like Methotrexate, what is the most important consideration when integrating high-dose botanical therapies?",
            "options": [
                "Botanicals should always be taken at the exact same time as the medication",
                "Potential for Cytochrome P450 enzyme interactions that may alter drug metabolism",
                "Ensuring the botanicals increase the client's heart rate",
                "Eliminating all dietary fiber to ensure drug absorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many botanicals (like St. John's Wort or high-dose Curcumin) can induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes in the liver, potentially leading to sub-therapeutic levels or toxicity of conventional medications."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Phase III detoxification refers to the transport and excretion of conjugated toxins. Which intervention best supports Phase III by preventing the 'enterohepatic recirculation' of toxins?",
            "options": [
                "Low-fiber diets to speed up transit time",
                "High-dose Vitamin D3 supplementation",
                "The use of soluble fibers and binders (e.g., activated charcoal or modified citrus pectin)",
                "Restricting water intake to concentrate urine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III involves moving toxins into the bile or urine. Soluble fibers and binders 'trap' toxins in the digestive tract, preventing them from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream via the portal vein."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "In the AIP reintroduction phase, what is the 'gold standard' timeframe for monitoring a client's reaction to a single reintroduced food before introducing the next item?",
            "options": [
                "2 to 4 hours",
                "24 hours exactly",
                "3 to 7 days",
                "At least 3 weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autoimmune reactions can be delayed (Type IV hypersensitivity). Monitoring for 3 to 7 days allows the practitioner to observe changes in energy, joint pain, skin, or digestion that may not appear immediately."
