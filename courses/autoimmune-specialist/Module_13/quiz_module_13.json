            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "The 'Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway' describes the mechanism by which the Vagus nerve modulates the immune system. Which receptor on macrophages is responsible for inhibiting TNF-alpha release when bound by acetylcholine?",
            "options": [
                "Alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR)",
                "Beta-2 adrenergic receptor",
                "Muscarinic M1 receptor",
                "Glucocorticoid receptor alpha"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The α7nAChR is the specific receptor on splenic macrophages that, when stimulated by the vagus nerve's release of acetylcholine, inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) Resistance,' why might a client with chronic autoimmunity show high serum cortisol but still experience high levels of systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands are producing 'inactive' cortisol",
                "Chronic cytokine exposure reduces the binding affinity and translocation of the GR",
                "High cortisol levels automatically stimulate Th17 cell differentiation",
                "Cortisol only works on the innate immune system, not the adaptive system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-6 and TNF-alpha) can lead to GR resistance, where the receptors become less sensitive, meaning even high levels of cortisol fail to exert their usual anti-inflammatory effects."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in the course found that individuals with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis often exhibit a 'Non-Thyroidal Illness Syndrome' (NTIS) pattern during flares. What characterizes this peripheral hormone pattern?",
            "options": [
                "High TSH, Low T4, Low T3",
                "Low TSH, High T4, High T3",
                "Normal/Low TSH, Low T3, and High Reverse T3 (rT3)",
                "Normal TSH, High T4, Low rT3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NTIS, often driven by systemic inflammation (cytokines inhibiting 5'-deiodinase), results in decreased conversion of T4 to T3 and an increase in the production of the inactive isomer, rT3."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which sex-hormone dynamic explains why many women with Th1-dominant autoimmune conditions (like Rheumatoid Arthritis) experience temporary remission during the third trimester of pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "A massive surge in testosterone which is immunosuppressive",
                "The shift from a Th1 to a Th2-dominant immune profile driven by high Estriol and Progesterone",
                "A complete shutdown of the HPA axis during pregnancy",
                "The physical compression of the thymus by the growing fetus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pregnancy induces a Th2-dominant state to protect the fetus, which often provides relief for Th1-mediated autoimmune conditions, though it may exacerbate Th2-mediated conditions like SLE."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In 'Meta-inflammation' (metabolic inflammation), which protein complex is activated by saturated fatty acids and hyperglycemia, leading to the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18?",

                "The JAK-STAT signaling pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key sensor in the innate immune system that links metabolic excess (insulin resistance/high lipids) to the production of highly inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Melatonin is often referred to as an 'immunomodulator' rather than an immunosuppressant. What is its primary effect on the Th17/Treg balance?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates Th17 cells to increase acute inflammation",
                "It has no effect on T-cell differentiation",
                "It suppresses Th17 cell differentiation and promotes the expansion of Treg cells",
                "It converts Treg cells into pro-inflammatory Th1 cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin helps resolve autoimmunity by inhibiting the RORγt transcription factor (reducing Th17) and promoting Foxp3 expression (increasing Tregs)."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 35-year-old with SLE, reports that her joint pain is consistently worst at 4:00 AM. Based on Circadian Biology, what is the likely NEI driver of this timing?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol levels are at their highest peak at 4:00 AM",
                "The nocturnal surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) peaks while endogenous cortisol is still low",
                "Melatonin levels drop to zero at 4:00 AM, causing a 'rebound' inflammation",
                "Blood glucose levels are highest at 4:00 AM, triggering insulin resistance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 follow a circadian rhythm, peaking in the early morning hours before the morning cortisol surge is high enough to suppress them, leading to morning stiffness."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "According to the course material, what is the approximate female-to-male prevalence ratio for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?",

                "50:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SLE shows one of the strongest sex biases in autoimmunity, with a 9:1 female-to-male ratio, largely attributed to X-chromosome factors and estrogen's effects on B-cell activation."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "When working with a client exhibiting 'HPA Axis Dysfunction' and autoimmunity, why is it recommended to address circadian light exposure before introducing high-dose glandular supplements?",
            "options": [
                "Light exposure is the primary 'Zeitgeber' that synchronizes the master clock (SCN) which regulates the timing of the immune response",
                "Glandular supplements only work in the presence of blue light",
                "The immune system does not have a circadian rhythm",
                "Adrenal glandulars are toxic to the vagus nerve"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) requires light synchronization to properly time the HPA axis and immune oscillations; without this foundation, hormonal supplements may provide inconsistent results."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Gut-Brain-Immune' axis connection during a state of dysbiosis?",
            "options": [
                "LPS (Lipopolysaccharides) can trigger systemic inflammation that weakens the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and activates microglia",
                "Dysbiosis leads to an overproduction of GABA, which shuts down the immune system",
                "The gut has no influence on the brain's immune cells (microglia)",
                "Probiotics directly secrete cortisol into the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Intestinal permeability and dysbiosis allow LPS to enter circulation, which can trigger the NEI axis to produce 'sickness behavior' by activating microglial cells in the brain via cytokine signaling."
