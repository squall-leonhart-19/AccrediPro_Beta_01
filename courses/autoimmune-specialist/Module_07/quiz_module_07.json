            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "When applying the A.R.M.O.R. framework to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which biomarker is considered most predictive of erosive joint damage and aggressive disease progression?",
            "options": [
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",
                "Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (Anti-CCP)",
                "Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)",
                "Antinuclear Antibody (ANA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While CRP and ESR track current inflammation, Anti-CCP antibodies have a specificity of approximately 95% and are highly predictive of more severe, erosive disease progression in RA patients."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is often called 'The Great Imitator.' What physiological trigger is most likely to cause a systemic flare by inducing keratinocyte apoptosis and releasing nuclear antigens?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure",
                "Excessive dietary sodium intake",
                "Vitamin D supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "UV radiation triggers keratinocyte apoptosis, which in SLE patients leads to an accumulation of nuclear debris that the immune system misidentifies, triggering an inflammatory cascade and systemic flare."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "In Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), what is the primary site of inflammation that distinguishes it from Rheumatoid Arthritis?",
            "options": [
                "The synovial membrane exclusively",
                "The hyaline cartilage surface",
                "The enthesis (where tendons/ligaments attach to bone)",
                "The subchondral bone marrow"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Enthesitis—inflammation at the site where tendons, ligaments, or joint capsules attach to the bone—is a hallmark feature of PsA and other spondyloarthropathies, whereas RA primarily targets the synovium."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic low back pain that improves with exercise but worsens with rest, specifically in the early morning. Which genetic marker is present in approximately 90% of individuals with this condition (Ankylosing Spondylitis)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HLA-B27 is strongly associated with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). While not diagnostic on its own, its presence in a client with inflammatory back pain significantly increases the clinical suspicion of AS."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Sjögren’s Syndrome involves the lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands. Beyond 'sicca' symptoms (dryness), patients with Sjögren’s have a significantly increased risk (up to 44 times higher) of developing which complication?",

                "Synovial hypertrophy and pannus formation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia is characterized by central sensitization—a state where the central nervous system amplifies sensory input—rather than the overt tissue destruction or autoantibody-mediated damage seen in RA or SLE."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, while Copper is essential for the enzyme lysyl oxidase, both of which are critical for the structural integrity and cross-linking of collagen."

            "question": "What is the clinical significance of 'Pannus' formation in the context of Rheumatoid Arthritis?",
            "options": [
                "It is a protective layer of fluid in the joint",
                "It is an abnormal layer of fibrovascular tissue that invades the joint space and erodes cartilage",
                "It is a type of skin rash associated with PsA",
                "It is a calcification of the spinal ligaments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pannus is the aggressive, hypertrophied synovial tissue that acts like a tumor, secreting collagenases and proteases that destroy the articular cartilage and underlying bone in RA."
