            "options": [
                "To identify the genetic markers responsible for the autoimmune condition.",
                "To immediately reduce the systemic 'fire' and symptom severity before deep-diving into root causes.",
                "To implement a permanent, lifelong ketogenic diet.",
                "To begin heavy metal chelation therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in CALM stands for Contain Inflammation. Its goal is to stabilize the client and reduce acute symptom flares through anti-inflammatory nutrition and lifestyle shifts before the body can handle the more intensive 'Address Root Causes' phase."

            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis of the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet showed that participants with IBD and Hashimoto's experienced significant improvement in quality of life. Which of the following is strictly EXCLUDED during the elimination phase of the AIP diet?",
            "options": [
                "Cruciferous vegetables and leafy greens.",
                "Wild-caught fish and grass-fed beef.",
                "Nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, peppers) and grains.",
                "Fermented foods like sauerkraut and kombucha."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AIP elimination phase excludes grains, legumes, nightshades, dairy, eggs, nuts, seeds, and processed sugars to reduce potential antigenic load on the immune system."

            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "The Neuro-Endocrine-Immune (NEI) Axis describes the bidirectional communication between systems. How does chronic activation of the HPA axis typically affect Th1/Th2 balance?",
            "options": [
                "It has no effect on immune polarity.",
                "It causes a permanent suppression of all cytokine production.",
                "Chronic cortisol exposure can lead to a Th2 shift, potentially suppressing cell-mediated immunity while aggravating certain antibody-driven responses.",
                "It exclusively increases Th1 activity, leading to acute viral clearance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and prolonged cortisol elevation (HPA axis dysregulation) often lead to a 'Th2 shift,' which can suppress the Th1 (cell-mediated) response and alter the overall immune balance, making the client more susceptible to certain infections and chronic inflammation."

            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "In Neuro-Autoimmunity (Module 14), what is the role of 'Microglia' in the brain-immune axis?",
            "options": [
                "They act as the primary structural support for neurons.",
                "They are the resident immune cells of the CNS; when chronically activated ('primed'), they can cause neuroinflammation and tissue damage.",
                "They produce myelin sheaths for peripheral nerves.",
                "They prevent glucose from entering the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Microglia are the brain's innate immune cells. While protective in an acute sense, chronic 'priming' due to systemic inflammation or BBB breach leads to sustained neuroinflammation, contributing to 'brain fog' and cognitive decline in autoimmune patients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first rule of toxicology is 'remove the exposure.' Before active detoxification, you must identify and mitigate the source of toxins and ensure the organs of elimination (emunctories) are supported."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "Which of the following statistics regarding autoimmune prevalence is most accurate based on current epidemiological data?",
            "options": [
                "Autoimmune diseases affect approximately 1% of the global population.",
                "Women are affected at significantly higher rates than men, often cited as representing roughly 75-80% of all autoimmune cases.",
                "Autoimmune diseases have been declining since the year 2000 due to better hygiene.",
                "Men are 10x more likely to develop Hashimoto's than women."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epidemiological data consistently shows a strong female predominance in autoimmunity, with women making up approximately 78% of the affected population, likely due to hormonal and X-chromosome factors."

                "Autoimmune clients require exactly 12 hours of sleep to suppress Th17 cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep is critical for the glymphatic system (brain detoxification) and for regulating the balance of T-regulatory cells versus pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. Chronic sleep deprivation is a known trigger for autoimmune flares."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is a highly sensitive marker for systemic inflammation. While non-specific to a single disease, levels above 1.0 mg/L in a functional context suggest an active inflammatory process that needs 'Containing' (the 'C' in CALM)."
