            "question": "In the C.A.L.M. Protocol™, what is the primary distinction between the 'Contain' (C) and 'Address' (A) phases?",
            "options": [
                "Contain focuses on long-term remission, while Address focuses on immediate symptom relief.",
                "Contain focuses on neutralizing immediate inflammatory triggers, while Address targets underlying systemic dysfunctions like the gut-immune axis.",
                "Contain is strictly dietary, while Address is strictly supplemental.",
                "There is no distinction; they are performed simultaneously from day one."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Contain' phase is designed to lower the 'total toxic load' and dampen acute inflammation immediately, whereas 'Address' goes deeper into root causes like intestinal permeability and chronic infections."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to the statistics cited in Lesson 2, what level of High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is considered a high-risk indicator for systemic inflammation in autoimmune populations?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 0.5 mg/L",
                "Greater than 1.0 mg/L",
                "Greater than 3.0 mg/L",
                "Greater than 10.0 mg/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines and the course material identify an hs-CRP level >3.0 mg/L as a significant indicator of systemic inflammation and increased cardiovascular/autoimmune risk."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the 'Gut-Immune Axis.' Which protein, when elevated in a stool or serum test, indicates the breakdown of tight junctions (intestinal permeability)?",
            "options": [
                "Albumin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Calprotectin",
                "Secretory IgA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; elevated levels are a validated biomarker for increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut')."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis tests positive for high early antigen (EA) titers of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). This likely contributes to autoimmunity through which mechanism discussed in Lesson 4?",
            "options": [
                "Bystander Activation",
                "Molecular Mimicry",
                "Viral Sequestration",
                "Direct DNA Mutation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses viral proteins (like those in EBV) with self-structures (like thyroid tissue) due to structural similarities."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "During the Elimination Phase of the AIP Diet (Lesson 5), which of these 'health foods' must be removed due to their potential to cross-react with gluten or irritate the GI lining?",
            "options": [

                "Quinoa and Amaranth",
                "Sweet Potatoes and Yams",
                "Spinach and Kale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pseudo-grains like quinoa and amaranth are excluded in the AIP elimination phase because they contain prolamins and saponins that can aggravate the immune system in sensitive individuals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 6 indicates that a single night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) can lead to what physiological change in the immune system?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% decrease in cortisol production",
                "A 25% increase in the activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB",
                "A total shutdown of T-regulatory cell activity",
                "A temporary cure for autoimmune flares"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Irwin et al.) show that even minor sleep loss triggers the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway, which is a major driver of autoimmune progression."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the 'Maintain' (M) phase, what is the specific protocol for reintroducing a 'Stage 1' food (e.g., egg yolks)?",
            "options": [
                "Eat a full serving three times a day for one week.",
                "Eat a small amount, wait 15 minutes; eat a slightly larger amount, wait 2 hours; then wait 3-7 days for a delayed reaction.",
                "Mix the food with a known safe food and consume it only at dinner.",
                "Reintroduce three different foods at once to speed up the process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The reintroduction protocol requires a staggered 'test' dose followed by a 3-7 day observation period to monitor for delayed IgG-mediated reactions or symptomatic flares."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "A 42-year-old client with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) experiences a flare after 6 months of remission. What is the first recommended step in Flare Management (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately start a high-dose prednisone cycle without consulting a doctor.",
                "Return to the strict AIP Elimination phase and conduct a 'Trigger Audit' of the last 72 hours.",
                "Increase exercise intensity to 'sweat out' the inflammation.",
                "Stop all supplements immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The protocol recommends returning to a 'baseline' safe diet (Elimination phase) and auditing recent triggers (stress, sleep, hidden ingredients, or infection) to identify the cause of the flare."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which nutrient is highlighted in Lesson 5 as being essential for the differentiation of T-regulatory (Treg) cells, with deficiency found in up to 75% of autoimmune patients?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Calcium",
                "Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 acts more like a hormone than a vitamin; it is crucial for immune tolerance by promoting the production of Treg cells which prevent the immune system from attacking self-tissue."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "When addressing toxins (Lesson 4), why is it critical to support 'Phase II' liver detoxification specifically for autoimmune clients?",
            "options": [
                "Phase II is where toxins are made water-soluble for excretion; if Phase I is faster than Phase II, reactive intermediates can increase oxidative stress.",
                "Phase II is the only phase that handles heavy metals.",
                "Phase II bypasses the kidneys entirely.",
                "Phase II is responsible for the digestion of macronutrients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If Phase I (biotransformation) outpaces Phase II (conjugation), the body accumulates highly reactive intermediate metabolites that damage tissues and trigger further autoimmune activity."
