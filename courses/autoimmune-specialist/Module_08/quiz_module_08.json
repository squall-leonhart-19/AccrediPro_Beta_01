            "question": "In Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, the destruction of thyroid follicular cells is primarily mediated by which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and T-cell infiltration",
                "Excessive production of Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins (TSI)",
                "A deficiency in Iodine leading to goiter formation",
                "The over-activation of the Th2 immune pathway exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hashimoto’s is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration (mainly T-cells) and the production of TPO and Tg antibodies, leading to apoptosis of follicular cells via ADCC."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Thyroid Eye Disease (TED), common in Graves' patients, is caused by antibodies attacking the TSH receptor in which specific tissue?",
            "options": [
                "The optic nerve sheath",
                "Orbital fibroblasts and adipocytes",
                "The lacrimal glands exclusively",
                "The crystalline lens of the eye"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Graves’ ophthalmopathy occurs because TSH receptors are expressed on orbital fibroblasts; antibody binding triggers inflammation, hyaluronan production, and adipogenesis behind the eye."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the research discussed in Lesson 3, which dietary intervention showed a significant potential to preserve C-peptide levels in newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetics?",
            "options": [
                "A high-protein, zero-carb ketogenic diet",
                "A gluten-free diet, particularly when started early in the 'honeymoon phase'",
                "The consumption of fermented dairy three times daily",
                "A low-fat vegan diet with high soy intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (such as Sildorf et al., 2012) suggest that a gluten-free diet may prolong the 'honeymoon phase' by reducing antigenic load and preserving beta-cell function (C-peptide)."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Clinical symptoms of Addison’s Disease (Primary Adrenal Insufficiency) typically do not manifest until what percentage of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed?",
            "options": [
                "25%",
                "50%",
                "75%",
                "90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Addison's is often 'silent' until approximately 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, making early screening for 21-hydroxylase antibodies critical for prevention of adrenal crisis."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "What is the statistical prevalence link between PCOS and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis discussed in Lesson 5?",
            "options": [
                "Women with PCOS are 3 times more likely to have Hashimoto’s than the general population",
                "There is no statistically significant link between the two conditions",
                "PCOS is only linked to Graves' disease, not Hashimoto's",
                "100% of PCOS patients will eventually develop hypothyroidism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (like Romitti et al., 2018) show a 3-fold increase in Hashimoto's prevalence among women with PCOS, suggesting a shared genetic or immune-dysregulatory etiology."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which endocrine disruptor (EDC) is specifically noted for its 'molecular mimicry' where it binds to thyroid hormone receptors and acts as a T3 antagonist?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",
                "Magnesium Citrate",
                "Omega-3 fatty acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA has a chemical structure that allows it to bind to thyroid hormone receptors, potentially blocking the action of T3 and contributing to 'cellular hypothyroidism' despite normal blood levels."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the 'Thyroid Triangle' (Lesson 7), why is Selenium supplementation mandatory before or alongside high-dose Iodine in Hashimoto's cases?",
            "options": [
                "Selenium increases the absorption of Iodine in the gut",
                "Selenium is needed for the enzyme Glutathione Peroxidase to neutralize H2O2 produced during Iodine oxidation",
                "Iodine cannot be converted to T4 without Selenium",
                "Selenium prevents the kidneys from excreting Iodine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iodine oxidation by TPO produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Without adequate Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, this H2O2 can damage the thyroid gland and exacerbate autoimmunity."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the Case Study 'The Exhausted Executive' (Lesson 8), which lab pattern suggested 'Subclinical Hypothyroidism' rather than overt failure?",
            "options": [
                "Low TSH, High FT4, High T3",
                "High TSH, Normal FT4, Elevated TPO antibodies",
                "Normal TSH, Low FT4, Low TPO antibodies",
                "High TSH, Low FT4, Low T3"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH (typically >4.5 mIU/L) while the peripheral hormones (FT4/FT3) remain within the laboratory reference range."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "What is the primary risk of the 'Jod-Basedow effect' when working with clients who have underlying thyroid nodules or Graves' disease?",
            "options": [
                "It causes immediate hair loss",
                "It induces Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism",
                "It leads to permanent adrenal failure",
                "It causes a sudden drop in blood glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Jod-Basedow effect occurs when an influx of Iodine leads to the autonomous production of excessive thyroid hormone, potentially triggering a thyrotoxic crisis in susceptible individuals."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which nutrient is essential for the deiodinase enzymes responsible for converting T4 (inactive) to T3 (active)?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium",
                "Selenium",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Fluoride"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The deiodinase enzymes (D1, D2, D3) are selenoproteins; therefore, Selenium deficiency is a leading cause of poor T4 to T3 conversion."
