            "question": "When transitioning from 1:1 coaching to a 'One-to-Many' group model, what is the primary financial metric used to justify the shift in operational delivery?",
            "options": [
                "Total Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)",
                "Effective Hourly Rate (EHR) per delivery hour",
                "Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)",
                "Net Promoter Score (NPS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While MRR is important, the EHR measures the efficiency of your time. In group coaching, if you charge 10 people $500/month for one hour of weekly group work, your EHR is $5,000/hr, compared to perhaps $250/hr in 1:1 settings."

            "question": "In a Digital Product Ecosystem (L2), what is the primary strategic function of a 'Tripwire' offer priced between $27 and $97?",
            "options": [
                "To generate the majority of the company's net profit",
                "To cover the costs of the founder's salary",
                "To convert a lead into a customer and psychologically prime them for higher-tier offers",
                "To replace the need for a high-ticket mastermind"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A tripwire's goal is not high profit margins but customer acquisition. Once a lead makes a small financial commitment, they are statistically more likely to purchase a core offering or high-ticket program."

            "question": "According to the principles of Operational Excellence (L3), at what revenue milestone should a coaching business typically transition from 'Founder-Led Sales' to an automated or delegated sales system?",

                "$250,000 - $500,000 per year",
                "Only after reaching $1,000,000 per year"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaling beyond the $250k-$500k mark usually requires the founder to step out of every sales call to focus on high-level strategy and leadership, necessitating CRMs and dedicated enrollment officers."

            "question": "In the context of B2B Medical Referrals (L4), what is a 'Business Associate Agreement' (BAA) and why is it mandatory for scaling practitioners in the US?",

                "A contract that allows the coach to prescribe medication",
                "A legal document required by HIPAA to ensure the protection of PHI when sharing data with medical partners",
                "A marketing agreement to share social media followers",
                "A certification that allows a coach to work inside a hospital"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To scale via medical referrals, you must be HIPAA compliant. A BAA is a legal requirement when a third party (the coach) handles Protected Health Information (PHI) on behalf of a covered entity (the doctor)."

            "options": [
                "Licensing requires you to pay for the licensees' health insurance",
                "Licensing creates a passive revenue stream with lower overhead and reduced vicarious liability",
                "Licensing allows you to control every word the other coach says",
                "Licensing is only legal for medical doctors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licensing allows other practitioners to use your IP (Intellectual Property) for a fee. This scales your impact without the management overhead and payroll taxes associated with a large internal employee base."

            "options": [

                "By the average price of a local gym membership"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing looks at the outcome. For an executive, reversing a chronic condition can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in saved medical costs and increased career longevity, justifying a $10k-$25k retreat price point."

                "Systems tend to break when a team grows to 3 people, and again at 10 people",
                "It takes 3 months to train a coach and 10 months for them to be profitable",
                "You should offer 3 low-ticket products for every 10 high-ticket ones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 3 and 10' suggests that everything in a business (communication, software, culture) breaks or requires significant overhaul every time the team size triples (1 to 3, 3 to 10, 10 to 30)."

            "question": "For a long-term exit strategy (L8), a business is often valued as a multiple of EBITDA. If a coaching firm has $1,000,000 in revenue and $300,000 in EBITDA, what would a 4x valuation be?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Valuation is typically based on a multiple of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). $300,000 (EBITDA) x 4 (Multiple) = $1,200,000."

            "options": [
                "The business is highly optimized; start spending $100k/month on ads",
                "The 2:1 ratio is risky for scaling; aim to optimize the funnel to reach a 3:1 ratio or higher",
                "The business is failing and should be closed",
                "The CAC is too low and should be increased to find better clients"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio is generally considered the 'gold standard' for sustainable scaling. A 2:1 ratio leaves very little room for operational overhead and profit after paying for the customer."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
