            "options": [
                "Licensing allows the coach to retain Intellectual Property (IP) while granting others the right to use it, usually with less operational control than a franchise.",
                "Franchising is always cheaper for the coach to set up.",
                "Licensing requires the coach to manage the daily staff of the licensee.",

            "options": [
                "Because they include expensive organic catering",
                "Because the high price tag is the only reason clients see results",
                "Because they remove clients from environmental triggers and habit cues, facilitating rapid behavioral change",
                "Because they require the coach to fly to international locations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Immersive retreats allow for 'pattern interrupts.' By removing clients from their daily environments, coaches can implement new plant-based habits more effectively, justifying the premium price through superior outcomes."

            "options": [
                "1:1 (Breaking even)",
                "At least 3:1 (LTV is triple the CAC)",
                "0.5:1 (Spending more to acquire than the client is worth)",
                "1:10 (Spending 10x more on marketing than revenue)"

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Buyers look for 'turnkey' operations. A business with documented systems (SOPs) and recurring revenue is much more valuable than one that relies solely on the owner's personal presence."
