            "question": "According to the 'Ringelmann Effect' discussed in Group Dynamics, what is a primary risk when group sizes for a plant-based challenge become too large without sub-groups?",
            "options": [
                "Increased competition leads to higher dropout rates",
                "Individual effort decreases as the group size increases (Social Loafing)",
                "Participants experience decision fatigue regarding meal prep",
                "The 'Fresh Start Effect' is neutralized by group size"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ringelmann Effect describes the tendency for individual members of a group to become less productive as the size of the group increases, a phenomenon often called social loafing. Effective coaches use sub-groups to maintain individual accountability."

            "question": "When designing a 30-Day Plant-Based Challenge, why is 'Phase 2' (Days 11-20) often referred to as the 'Critical Transition'?",
            "options": [
                "It is when the 'honeymoon phase' of motivation wanes and physiological cravings often peak",
                "It is the period where participants are required to fast",
                "It is the only time when weight loss is actually measured",
                "It is when the '90-9-1' rule of digital engagement ceases to apply"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research into habit formation shows that after the initial excitement (Days 1-10), participants hit a 'wall' where novelty wears off and biological adaptations to dietary changes can cause temporary discomfort, requiring higher levels of coaching support."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "In Culinary Medicine workshops, what is the primary psychological objective of 'Hands-On' participation compared to 'Demonstration-Only' models?",
            "options": [
                "To reduce the cost of ingredients for the facilitator",
                "To ensure the facilitator does not have to cook",
                "To increase participant 'Self-Efficacy' (the belief in one's ability to execute a task)",
                "To comply with local health department regulations for food service"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Culinary Medicine emphasizes self-efficacy. Studies show that when participants physically chop, season, and cook plant-based foods, they are significantly more likely to replicate those behaviors at home than if they merely watched a demonstration."

            "question": "A 2022 study on Corporate Wellness found that for every $1 invested in employee health programs, the average Return on Investment (ROI) in reduced absenteeism and healthcare costs was approximately:",
            "options": [
                "$1.10 to $1.50",

                "$0.50 (usually a net loss)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses of corporate wellness ROI, including the landmark Harvard study, suggest an average return of $3.27 for every dollar spent due to reduced healthcare costs and $2.73 for every dollar spent on reduced absenteeism."

            "options": [
                "Ignoring the participant until they stop talking",
                "Immediately removing them from the Zoom call or room",
                "The 'Parking Lot' technique: acknowledging the point and offering to discuss it privately after the session",
                "Publicly debating the participant to prove them wrong with studies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Parking Lot' (or 'Holding Tank') technique allows the facilitator to maintain the group's schedule and psychological safety without alienating the participant or allowing the session to be derailed by a 'Dominator' or 'Dissenter'."

                "All clients must complete 10 years of group work before 1-on-1 access",
                "Clients start with low-intensity group support and 'step up' to 1-on-1 coaching only if they don't meet clinical markers",
                "Coaches only work with clients on stair-climbing exercises",
                "The coach alternates between plant-based and keto diets every other week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stepped Care model improves efficiency by providing the least intensive intervention (group/digital) first, reserving resource-heavy 1-on-1 coaching for those who require more specialized clinical or psychological attention."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In most online communities, 90% of users are 'lurkers' (observers), 9% are 'contributors' (occasional commenters), and only 1% are 'creators' (power users who drive the majority of the content)."

            "question": "When measuring the ROI of a 6-month plant-based program for a client with Type 2 Diabetes, which metric provides the most objective 'Hard ROI' data?",
            "options": [
                "The participant's subjective 'happiness' score",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hard ROI is calculated using objective, quantifiable data. In metabolic health coaching, the reduction in HbA1c and the subsequent reduction or elimination of expensive medications (like insulin) provide a clear financial and clinical value."

            "id": "q34_9",

            "options": [
                "By encouraging employees to work more hours",
                "By reducing the 'afternoon slump' and cognitive fog associated with high-fat/high-sugar processed meals",

                "By making the office smell like vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Presenteeism refers to employees being physically present but unproductive due to poor health or low energy. Plant-based interventions improve glycemic control, reducing the energy crashes that significantly impact afternoon productivity."

            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "To achieve a 'Net Promoter Score' (NPS) that indicates a 'World Class' group program, what is the required score range?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from Promoters. A score above 0 is good, above 50 is excellent, and above 70 is considered 'World Class' (comparable to brands like Apple or Tesla)."
