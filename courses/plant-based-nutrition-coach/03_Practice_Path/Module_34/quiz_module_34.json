            "options": ["Forming", "Storming", "Norming", "Performing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Introduction of complex macronutrient ratios", "Detoxification of processed sugar stores", "Strengthening neural pathways for habit automaticity", "Maximizing rapid weight loss for marketing data"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The final week of a 21-day challenge focuses on habit consolidation, where the repetition of plant-based choices begins to move from conscious effort to subconscious automaticity."

            "question": "In the context of Culinary Medicine workshops, how does the 'Mise en Place' principle specifically assist in behavior change for novice cooks?",
            "options": ["It increases the caloric density of the meal", "It reduces cognitive load by organizing tasks before cooking begins", "It ensures the meal is aesthetically pleasing for social media", "It eliminates the need for knife skills training"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mise en Place (everything in its place) reduces the 'executive function' burden on participants, making the transition to plant-based cooking feel less overwhelming and more achievable."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening de-escalates resistance by making the participant feel heard, while group-sourcing the answer leverages 'social proof' to correct misconceptions without a direct confrontation."

            "explanation": "Also known as social loafing, the Ringelmann Effect means individuals may work less hard in a large group. Coaches counteract this by using 'breakout rooms' or individual accountability tasks."
