            "question": "In Lesson 1, the concept of 'Niche Identification' suggests that a coach who targets 'everyone interested in health' often fails because:",
            "options": [
                "The market for general health is too small to be profitable",
                "Broad messaging lacks the resonance required to convert high-ticket clients in a saturated market",
                "Plant-based nutrition is too specific to be marketed to a general audience",
                "Generalist coaches are legally required to hold a medical degree"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In marketing, 'vague is the enemy of conversion.' Narrowing a niche allows for specific messaging that addresses the unique pain points of a sub-group, increasing perceived authority and conversion rates."

            "id": "q31_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, a 'Proprietary Methodology' is essential for Authority Branding because it:",
            "options": [

                "Is a legal requirement for insurance purposes in the US and UK",
                "Transitions the coach from a 'commodity' to a 'category of one' by offering a unique process",
                "Ensures that no other coach can use plant-based protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A proprietary methodology (e.g., 'The 4-Pillar Plant Protocol') differentiates a coach from competitors who offer generic advice, making the coach the only person who can deliver that specific result."

            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "When designing a 'Lead Magnet' (Lesson 3), what is the primary metric used to determine its effectiveness at the Top of Funnel (TOFU)?",

                "The Opt-in Rate (percentage of visitors who provide their email address)",
                "The length of the PDF document provided"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lead magnets are designed to build an email list. The Opt-in Rate is the critical KPI to determine if the offer is attractive enough to the target niche to justify an exchange of contact information."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Social Media Ecosystems.' What is the primary purpose of 'Nurture Content' compared to 'Viral Content'?",
            "options": [
                "Nurture content is designed to get the maximum number of shares and reach",
                "Nurture content builds trust and depth with the existing audience to move them toward a sale",
                "Nurture content is only used for paid advertisements",
                "Nurture content focuses exclusively on debunking competitors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While viral content brings new eyes to a profile, nurture content (educational posts, case studies, behind-the-scenes) builds the relationship and trust necessary for a prospect to invest in high-ticket coaching."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Successful sales calls rely on identifying the 'Gap.' By highlighting the distance between where a client is (pain) and where they want to be (pleasure), the coach positions their program as the bridge."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic partners should share the same target audience but offer a different service. Yoga studios and functional medicine doctors have health-conscious clients who often need specialized nutritional guidance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CAC is calculated by dividing the total marketing spend ($1,000) by the number of customers acquired (2). $1,000 / 2 = $500."

            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, why is 'Lifetime Value' (LTV) a more critical metric than initial sale price?",
            "options": [
                "It is 5 to 25 times more expensive to acquire a new client than to retain an existing one",
                "LTV allows coaches to charge less for their initial programs",
                "High LTV is required by law for nutritional certification",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Business sustainability relies on retention. Because the cost of acquisition is high, maximizing the value of each client through renewals or upsells (LTV) significantly increases profitability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If traffic is present but conversion is zero, the issue is usually the 'Offer'—the value proposition on the page is either unclear or not desirable to the people clicking the link."
