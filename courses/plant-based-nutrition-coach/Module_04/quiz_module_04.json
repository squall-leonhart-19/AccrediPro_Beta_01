            "question": "Which transcription factor acts as the 'master switch' for the inflammatory response, moving into the cell nucleus to trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha?",
            "options": [
                "mTOR",
                "NF-κB (Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NF-κB is the primary protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine production, and cell survival in response to inflammatory stimuli."

            "question": "A client's blood work shows an hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) level of 3.8 mg/L. Based on the lesson on inflammatory markers, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal/Low Risk (<1.0 mg/L)",
                "Average Risk (1.0 - 3.0 mg/L)",
                "High Risk (>3.0 mg/L)",
                "Acute Infection Only (>10.0 mg/L)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines categorize hs-CRP levels above 3.0 mg/L as high risk for cardiovascular disease and chronic systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The 'Omega Balance' is critical in a plant-based diet. What is the primary reason that a very high intake of Linoleic Acid (LA) from seed oils can be pro-inflammatory?",
            "options": [
                "It directly inhibits the digestion of proteins",
                "It competes for the same desaturase and elongase enzymes needed to convert ALA to EPA/DHA",
                "It increases the pH of the blood significantly",
                "It prevents the absorption of Vitamin K"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-6 (LA) and Omega-3 (ALA) compete for the delta-6 desaturase enzyme; an excess of Omega-6 slows the already inefficient conversion of plant-based ALA into anti-inflammatory EPA and DHA."

                "Piperine",
                "Allicin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Piperine, the active alkaloid in black pepper, inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that would otherwise rapidly eliminate curcumin from the body."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 7, we discussed Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs). Which of the following cooking methods results in the LOWEST production of these inflammatory compounds?",
            "options": [

                "Steaming or poaching in liquid",
                "Broiling under direct flame"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Moist heat at lower temperatures (steaming, poaching, stewing) significantly limits the formation of AGEs compared to high-heat, dry cooking methods."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Boswellia serrata (Indian Frankincense) is unique among botanical anti-inflammatories because it specifically inhibits which enzyme pathway?",
            "options": [
                "COX-1",
                "COX-2",
                "5-LOX (5-Lipoxygenase)",
                "Aromatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While many NSAIDs target COX enzymes, Boswellia is a potent inhibitor of 5-LOX, which is responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which dietary component has been shown in meta-analyses to reduce hs-CRP levels by an average of 25-30% in patients with hypercholesterolemia?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high intake of dietary fiber from whole plants is consistently associated with lower circulating levels of CRP, likely due to its impact on the gut microbiome and glucose regulation."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants. Which endogenous 'master antioxidant' system is up-regulated by the Nrf2 pathway in response to phytonutrients like sulforaphane?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Nrf2 pathway triggers the body's internal production of antioxidant enzymes, most notably glutathione, which is the body's primary endogenous antioxidant."

            "question": "In the context of autoimmune markers (Lesson 8), what is the mechanism by which 'leaky gut' (increased intestinal permeability) contributes to systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the stomach to produce too much acid",
                "It allows lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and undigested proteins to enter the bloodstream, triggering an immune response",
                "It prevents the absorption of all dietary fats",
                "It leads to the overgrowth of beneficial Bifidobacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased permeability allows endotoxins like LPS from bacterial cell walls to cross the epithelial barrier, activating the immune system and increasing systemic inflammatory markers."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client following a standard American diet typically has an Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio of 16:1. According to the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™, what is the target ratio for an anti-inflammatory alignment?",

                "Ratios do not matter as long as total fat is low"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research into human evolution and modern clinical trials suggests that a ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 is optimal for suppressing chronic inflammation."
