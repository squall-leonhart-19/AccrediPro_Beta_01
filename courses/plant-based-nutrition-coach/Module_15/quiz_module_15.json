            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Bone Health,' what does a negative Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) score signify regarding a food's impact on bone mineral density?",
            "options": [
                "The food is acid-forming and may increase urinary calcium excretion.",
                "The food is alkaline-forming and helps preserve the skeletal calcium carbonate buffer.",
                "The food is high in oxalates, which inhibits calcium absorption regardless of pH.",
                "The food contains high levels of phytates that promote osteoclast activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A negative PRAL score indicates that a food is alkaline-forming. In plant-based nutrition, high intake of fruits and vegetables (negative PRAL) reduces the need for the body to leach calcium carbonate from the bones to buffer metabolic acid."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Regarding phytoestrogens and endocrine health, which metabolite produced by specific gut microbiota is associated with the most significant reduction in menopausal symptoms and prostate cancer risk?",
            "options": [
                "Genistein",
                "Daidzein",
                "Equol",
                "Lignan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Equol is a potent metabolite produced from the soy isoflavone daidzein by specific gut bacteria. Approximately 30-50% of the population are 'equol producers,' and they typically experience greater hormonal benefits from soy consumption."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "The MIND Diet (a hybrid of Mediterranean and DASH) has shown significant neuroprotective effects. According to research cited in Lesson 3, strict adherence to this plant-rich protocol was associated with what reduction in Alzheimer's disease risk?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 35%",
                "Approximately 53%",
                "Approximately 78%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including the Rush University Medical Center research, found that participants who adhered strictly to the MIND diet lowered their risk of Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53%."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "For a plant-based athlete, what is the primary physiological mechanism by which dietary nitrates (found in arugula and beets) enhance exercise performance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the rate of Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) via the mTOR pathway.",
                "By reducing the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise and improving mitochondrial efficiency.",
                "By acting as a direct stimulant to the central nervous system to delay fatigue.",
                "By increasing the acidity of the blood to facilitate oxygen release from hemoglobin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which improves mitochondrial efficiency and reduces the amount of oxygen required for a given workload, thereby enhancing endurance performance."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "During pregnancy and lactation, why is the intake of Choline critical for plant-based clients, even if they are meeting their Folate requirements?",
            "options": [
                "Choline is the only nutrient that can prevent gestational diabetes.",
                "Choline is required for the synthesis of DHA from ALA.",
                "Choline and Folate work synergistically in one-carbon metabolism for fetal brain development and neural tube closure.",
                "Choline is necessary to prevent the 'leaching' of calcium from the mother's teeth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Folate is well-known, Choline is equally vital for one-carbon metabolism. It supports fetal brain structure, memory function, and works alongside folate to prevent neural tube defects."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' and prevent sarcopenia in geriatric plant-based patients, what is the recommended 'leucine trigger' threshold per meal?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.2 - 1.5 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "5.0 - 7.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In older adults, the 'leucine trigger' required to initiate muscle protein synthesis is higher than in younger individuals. Aiming for 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine per meal (via soy, legumes, or seeds) is necessary to combat sarcopenia."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which a high-fiber, whole-food plant-based diet improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the levels of Intramyocellular Lipids (IMCL) which signal the cells to burn sugar.",
                "By reducing the accumulation of Intramyocellular Lipids (IMCL), thereby clearing the 'interference' in the insulin signaling pathway.",
                "By eliminating the need for the pancreas to produce insulin entirely.",
                "By slowing down the heart rate to allow for better glucose absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intramyocellular lipids (fat inside muscle cells) interfere with the insulin signaling process. A low-fat, high-fiber WFPB diet helps reduce these lipids, restoring the cell's ability to respond to insulin (improving insulin sensitivity)."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8's 'Thrive' phase of behavior change, what is the significance of 'Identity Shift' compared to 'Outcome Goals'?",
            "options": [
                "Identity shifts are less effective than outcome goals because they are too vague.",
                "Identity shifts focus on who the client becomes (e.g., 'I am an athlete'), which leads to more sustainable, long-term habits than simply chasing a weight-loss number.",
                "Outcome goals are the only way to track progress in the Thrive phase.",
                "Identity shifts are only necessary for clients with clinical eating disorders."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable behavior change occurs when a client moves from 'doing' a diet to 'being' the person who lives that lifestyle. Identity-based habits are the hallmark of the 'Thrive' phase, ensuring long-term maintenance."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Which vitamin, often found in fermented plant foods like natto, is responsible for activating Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) to prevent vascular calcification while directing calcium to the bones?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)",
                "Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol)",
                "Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone)",
                "Vitamin E (Alpha-tocopherol)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) is crucial for bone health because it activates osteocalcin to bind calcium to the bone matrix and activates MGP to keep calcium out of the soft tissues and arteries."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A plant-based endurance athlete presents with high oxidative stress markers and delayed recovery. Which dietary intervention would be most evidence-based according to Module 15?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing intake of isolated Vitamin C and E supplements.",
                "Increasing intake of anthocyanin-rich foods (e.g., tart cherries, blueberries) to utilize the 'whole-food' antioxidant synergy.",
                "Reducing carbohydrate intake to force the body into ketosis for better recovery.",
                "Eliminating all legumes to reduce systemic inflammation caused by lectins."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Whole-food sources of antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins in berries and tart cherries, have been shown to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage and oxidative stress more effectively and safely than high-dose isolated supplements."
