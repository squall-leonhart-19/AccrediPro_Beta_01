            "question": "According to the 'Acid-Base Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 1, which measurement is most predictive of a food's impact on bone calcium leaching?",
            "options": [
                "The pH level of the food before ingestion",
                "The Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) score",
                "The total calcium-to-phosphorus ratio",
                "The glycemic index of the carbohydrate source"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PRAL score estimates the production of volatile acids during metabolism. High PRAL scores (common in meat and cheese) require the body to buffer acidity, potentially using calcium salts from bone, whereas low or negative PRAL scores (fruits and vegetables) are bone-protective."

            "question": "In the context of endocrine support, what does the 2022 meta-analysis of clinical trials conclude regarding soy isoflavones and thyroid function in iodine-sufficient individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Isoflavones significantly decrease T3 and T4 levels across all populations",
                "Soy intake causes a 15-20% increase in TSH levels regardless of iodine status",
                "Soy isoflavones have no clinically significant effect on thyroid hormone levels",
                "Soy isoflavones double the risk of developing Hashimoto’s thyroiditis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extensive clinical data indicates that soy isoflavones do not adversely affect thyroid function (T3, T4, or TSH) in individuals with adequate iodine intake, debunking common myths about soy being a dangerous goitrogen."

            "question": "The MIND Diet, discussed in Lesson 3, was shown in a landmark study to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's Disease by what percentage in participants who followed it strictly?",
            "options": [
                "25%",
                "33%",
                "53%",
                "72%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Rush University Medical Center study found that high adherence to the MIND diet (a hybrid of Mediterranean and DASH diets with a focus on plant-based neuroprotective foods) reduced Alzheimer's risk by 53%."

            "options": [
                "Consuming 200mg of Vitamin C with 500ml of beet juice 15 minutes before exercise",
                "Consuming 400-800mg of dietary nitrates 2-3 hours before high-intensity exercise",
                "Using antibacterial mouthwash immediately after eating leafy greens to accelerate conversion",
                "Restricting all nitrate-rich vegetables during the 'taper' phase to increase sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dietary nitrates (found in beets and arugula) take approximately 2-3 hours to reach peak plasma nitrite levels. Antibacterial mouthwash should be avoided as it kills the oral bacteria necessary for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite."

                "1,000mg/day; found in fortified nutritional yeast"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Adequate Intake (AI) for pregnancy is 450mg/day. While eggs are high in choline, plant-based sources like roasted soybeans, quinoa, and broccoli are essential for vegan clients to meet these needs."

            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in geriatric patients (Lesson 6), what is the specific 'Leucine Trigger' threshold recommended per meal to stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Older adults require a higher concentration of the amino acid leucine (2.5-3g) per meal to trigger the mTOR pathway and overcome the age-related decline in muscle protein synthetic response."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Intramyocellular Lipids' (IMCL). How does a low-fat, whole-food plant-based diet improve insulin sensitivity regarding IMCL?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the size of fat cells to store more IMCL safely",
                "By reducing the accumulation of fat droplets inside muscle cells, which otherwise block insulin signaling",
                "By converting IMCL into brown adipose tissue via thermogenesis",
                "By preventing glucose from entering the muscle cell entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "IMCLs are fat droplets inside muscle cells. High levels interfere with the insulin signaling pathway (specifically IRS-1). A WFPB diet helps 'clear' these lipids, restoring the cell's ability to respond to insulin and transport glucose."

                "Increasing the frequency of 'cheat days' to prevent burnout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved when a client no longer 'goes on a diet' but adopts the identity of 'someone who eats plants.' Identity-based habits (Atomic Habits framework) are more resilient than goal-based outcomes."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) plays a unique role in bone health by activating which specific protein?",
            "options": [
                "Hemoglobin",
                "Osteocalcin",

                "Amylase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 carboxylates (activates) osteocalcin, a protein secreted by osteoblasts that binds calcium to the bone matrix. Without K2, calcium may remain in the vasculature, contributing to arterial calcification."

                "0.8 g/kg (56g total)",
                "1.2 - 1.4 g/kg (84-98g total)",
                "1.6 - 2.2 g/kg (112-154g total)",
                "3.0 - 4.0 g/kg (210-280g total)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When in a caloric deficit, protein requirements increase to prevent muscle catabolism. For athletes, the range of 1.6-2.2 g/kg is the evidence-based standard to maintain lean body mass while losing fat."
