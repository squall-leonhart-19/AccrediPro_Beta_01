            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "The Aggregate Nutrient Density Index (ANDI), developed by Dr. Joel Fuhrman, calculates a food's score based on which specific formula?",
            "options": [
                "Total Fiber content / Glycemic Load",
                "Nutrient Content / Calories (H = N / C)",
                "Micronutrient Weight / Total Food Weight",
                "Antioxidant Capacity (ORAC) / Satiety Index"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ANDI score is based on the equation Health = Nutrients / Calories. It ranks foods based on how many nutrients they deliver per calorie, with leafy greens like kale and collard greens typically scoring a perfect 1,000."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Volume Eating' discussed in Lesson 2, which physiological mechanism is primarily responsible for signaling satiety when consuming high-nutrient, low-caloric density foods?",
            "options": [
                "Activation of mechanoreceptors (stretch receptors) in the stomach lining",
                "Rapid increase in blood glucose levels",
                "The suppression of the hormone ghrelin by dietary fats",
                "The thermal effect of protein metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Volume eating relies on the fact that the stomach has mechanoreceptors that signal fullness to the brain based on physical distension. High-volume, low-calorie foods (like vegetables) trigger these receptors without excessive caloric intake."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client is consuming adequate calcium but shows signs of poor bone mineralization. According to Lesson 4, which synergy is likely missing to ensure calcium is directed to the bones rather than soft tissues?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12 and Folate",
                "Vitamin C and Iron",
                "Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7)",
                "Magnesium and Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, while Vitamin K2 (specifically the MK-7 form) activates osteocalcin and Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) to ensure that calcium is deposited in the bones and teeth rather than the arteries."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Regarding trace minerals in Lesson 5, why is it recommended that plant-based individuals limit Brazil nut consumption to 1-2 nuts per day?",
            "options": [
                "High levels of phytic acid preventing mineral absorption",
                "Excessive saturated fat content",
                "Extremely high Selenium content, which can lead to selenosis",
                "To prevent the inhibition of Iodine uptake in the thyroid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A single Brazil nut can contain 68–91 mcg of Selenium. Since the RDA is 55 mcg and the Upper Limit (UL) is 400 mcg, consuming more than a few daily can lead to selenium toxicity (selenosis)."

            "question": "According to Lesson 6, which of the following plant-based foods has the HIGHEST fractional absorption rate for calcium, despite having lower absolute calcium than spinach?",
            "options": [
                "Spinach (due to high oxalates)",
                "Bok Choy (approx. 50-60% absorption)",
                "Almonds (approx. 20% absorption)",
                "Sesame Seeds (approx. 21% absorption)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While spinach is high in calcium, its bioavailability is very low (~5%) due to high oxalate content. Low-oxalate cruciferous vegetables like bok choy and kale have a high fractional absorption rate of 50-60%."

            "question": "When optimizing Zinc bioavailability in a plant-based diet, which preparation technique is most effective at reducing the 'anti-nutrient' phytic acid?",
            "options": [
                "Freezing and thawing",
                "Dehydrating at low temperatures",
                "Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting",
                "Adding oil to the cooking water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phytic acid binds to zinc and prevents absorption. Soaking, sprouting, and fermenting activate the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid and significantly increases zinc bioavailability."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 7's 'High-Density Meal Architecture,' what is the recommended 'Plate Method' ratio for a client focused on weight management and nutrient density?",
            "options": [
                "50% Grains, 25% Protein, 25% Fruit",
                "50% Non-starchy vegetables, 25% Legumes/Protein, 25% Intact Grains/Starchy Veg",

                "33% Fruit, 33% Vegetables, 33% Grains"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' focus in the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™ emphasizes filling half the plate with low-caloric-density, high-nutrient-density non-starchy vegetables to manage weight while maximizing micronutrients."

            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses Molybdenum as an essential trace mineral. What is its primary role in the human body?",
            "options": [
                "As a cofactor for enzymes that break down sulfites and prevent amino acid toxicity",
                "To assist in the production of thyroid hormones",
                "To facilitate the transport of oxygen in red blood cells",
                "To act as a primary antioxidant in the mitochondria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Molybdenum is a crucial cofactor for several enzymes, most notably sulfite oxidase, which converts sulfite to sulfate, preventing the buildup of toxic sulfites in the body."

            "question": "A client uses a tracking tool (Lesson 8) and notices their 'Nutrient-to-Calorie Ratio' is low despite eating 2,500 calories. What is the most likely cause?",
            "options": [
                "Eating too many leafy greens",
                "High consumption of refined oils and processed sugars",
                "Over-consumption of water-rich fruits",
                "Using too many spices and herbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Refined oils and sugars are 'empty calories'—they provide high caloric energy but almost zero micronutrients, which significantly lowers the overall nutrient-to-calorie ratio of the diet."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Based on the 2023 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 3 regarding the 'Micronutrient Gap,' which nutrient was found to be most frequently sub-optimal in long-term vegans who did not supplement?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Magnesium",
                "Manganese"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While plant-based diets are rich in many nutrients, Vitamin B12 is not reliably found in plant foods. Without supplementation or fortification, long-term vegans are at a very high risk of deficiency."
