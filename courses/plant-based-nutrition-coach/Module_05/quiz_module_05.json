            "question": "According to the psychology of sustainable change, why are 'identity-based habits' more effective than 'outcome-based' goals for long-term plant-based adherence?",
            "options": [
                "They focus on short-term caloric deficits rather than food quality.",
                "They shift the focus from what a person wants to achieve to who the person is becoming.",
                "They rely exclusively on willpower rather than environmental design.",
                "They prioritize external rewards like weight loss over internal values."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on the internal belief system (e.g., 'I am a person who nourishes my body with plants') rather than just a target outcome, which creates more resilient behavior change."

            "question": "For a plant-based strength athlete, what is the evidence-based protein intake range recommended to maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) during periods of intense training?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.4 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.6 - 2.2 g/kg of body weight",
                "3.0 - 3.5 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (e.g., Morton et al., 2018) suggest that for athletes, protein intakes between 1.6g and 2.2g per kg of body weight are optimal, even on a plant-based diet, provided the amino acid profile is diverse."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "When monitoring long-term plant-based clients, why is measuring Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) superior to measuring only Serum B12?",
            "options": [
                "Serum B12 can be falsely elevated by the consumption of inactive B12 analogues (e.g., from seaweed).",
                "MMA is cheaper to test in a standard clinical setting.",
                "Serum B12 only measures the B12 stored in the liver, not the blood.",
                "MMA levels decrease when a person consumes too much folic acid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Serum B12 can show 'normal' levels even in deficiency if the client consumes analogues or has high folate intake; MMA is a functional marker that rises only when cellular B12 is truly insufficient."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "A client traveling for work finds it difficult to find plant-based meals. Which 'Busy Lifestyle' strategy involves preparing components like grains, legumes, and sauces in advance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modular Batch Prep involves cooking versatile components (bases, proteins, fats) that can be quickly assembled into different meals, ensuring adherence during high-stress or travel periods."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RDA for iron increases from 18mg to 27mg during pregnancy to support fetal development and increased blood volume, which is a significant jump for plant-based individuals."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "If a client reaches a weight loss plateau on a whole-food plant-based diet, which adjustment targets 'Caloric Density' most effectively?",
            "options": [
                "Replacing all intact grains with flour-based products.",
                "Increasing the consumption of nuts and seeds to 50% of daily calories.",
                "Utilizing the '50/50 Plate' method (half the plate as non-starchy vegetables).",
                "Switching from water to fruit juices for hydration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 50/50 plate method reduces the average caloric density of the meal while maintaining high volume and satiety, helping to break plateaus without increasing hunger."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Ferritin is the storage form of iron. While hemoglobin measures oxygen-carrying capacity, ferritin reflects the body's actual iron reserves, which is critical for identifying 'pre-anemia' depletion."

                "75-100 grams per meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that older adults require a higher 'leucine trigger' and total protein per meal (roughly 0.4-0.5g/kg or ~25-40g) to overcome anabolic resistance compared to younger adults."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-Determination Theory (SDT) posits that when clients feel they have a choice (Autonomy), the skills to succeed (Competence), and a supportive community (Relatedness), they are more likely to maintain long-term habits."
