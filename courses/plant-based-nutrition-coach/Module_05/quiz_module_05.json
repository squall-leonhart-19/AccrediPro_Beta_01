            "question": "According to the psychology of sustainable change, which approach is most effective for long-term adherence to a plant-based lifestyle?",
            "options": [
                "Outcome-based habits focusing on the end result (e.g., losing 20lbs)",
                "Identity-based habits focusing on who the client becomes (e.g., 'I am a plant-based athlete')",
                "Extrinsic motivation driven by social pressure or clinical fear-tactics",
                "Strict adherence to a 21-day 'challenge' without a transition plan"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits are more sustainable because they shift the internal narrative from 'trying to do something' to 'being someone,' which reduces the cognitive load required to make healthy choices."

            "options": [
                "Ask for the manager, tell them your allergies, and ask for a discount",
                "Ask what others are ordering, tell them why you're vegan, and ask for their opinion",
                "Ask about the menu, tell the server your specific needs clearly, and ask for a confirmation or recommendation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Ask-Tell-Ask' method involves asking about ingredients/preparation, telling the server clearly about your dietary requirements, and asking for a recommendation to ensure a safe and satisfying meal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine per meal is required to reach the 'leucine trigger' and maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis, especially in plant-based diets where leucine concentrations may be lower."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Folate requirements increase significantly during pregnancy to support DNA synthesis and fetal development; a deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neural tube defects."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a specific functional marker for B12; if B12 is low at the cellular level, MMA levels will rise, providing a more accurate picture than serum B12 alone."

            "question": "A client experiences a weight loss plateau after 6 months. According to Lesson 7, what is the most likely metabolic reason for this, assuming caloric intake remains constant?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Adaptive Thermogenesis and a decrease in Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)",

                "A sudden increase in Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As weight is lost, the body often undergoes adaptive thermogenesis, where the BMR drops and the client subconsciously moves less (reduced NEAT) to conserve energy, leading to a plateau."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "In geriatric plant-based nutrition (65+), why is it recommended to increase protein intake to 1.2–1.5g/kg of body weight?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent Vitamin D toxicity",
                "To counteract 'anabolic resistance' and prevent sarcopenia",
                "Because older adults absorb fiber more efficiently",
                "To lower the risk of kidney stones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Older adults experience 'anabolic resistance,' meaning they require a higher concentration of amino acids (specifically leucine) to trigger the same muscle-building response as younger individuals, making higher protein intake essential to prevent muscle loss (sarcopenia)."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which specific Omega-3 index percentage is associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease and is the target for long-term monitoring?",

                "Less than 2%",
                "Exactly 4%",

                "Over 20%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Omega-3 Index (the amount of EPA and DHA in red blood cell membranes) of 8% to 12% is clinically associated with the highest level of cardioprotection."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In winter, reduced sunlight makes Vitamin D supplementation critical, while cooked, nutrient-dense whole foods (like stews and root vegetables) support thermogenesis and satiety during colder months."
