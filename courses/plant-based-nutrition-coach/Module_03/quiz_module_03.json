        {
            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which transcription factor is considered the 'master switch' of the inflammatory response that plant-based phytonutrients like quercetin help to inhibit?",
            "options": ["Nrf2", "NF-κB", "mTOR", "AMPK"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB) is the primary protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; its inhibition is a key goal of anti-inflammatory nutrition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the recommended target ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids to minimize systemic inflammation?",
            "options": ["Between 10:1 and 15:1", "Exactly 20:1", "Between 1:1 and 4:1", "Omega-6 should be 0:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the standard Western diet often reaches 15:1 or 20:1, a ratio of 1:1 to 4:1 is clinically associated with reduced risk of chronic inflammatory diseases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "To maximize the formation of sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables, which preparation technique is recommended by the 'Hack and Hold' method?",
            "options": ["Boiling the vegetables for at least 20 minutes", "Chopping the raw vegetables and waiting 40 minutes before cooking", "Microwaving the vegetables on high heat immediately", "Adding vinegar to the water while blanching"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chopping activates the enzyme myrosinase, which converts glucoraphanin into sulforaphane; waiting 40 minutes allows this conversion to complete before heat (which deactivates myrosinase) is applied."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, the bioavailability of curcumin (from turmeric) was shown to increase by what percentage when consumed with piperine (from black pepper)?",
            "options": ["50%", "200%", "1,000%", "2,000%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that piperine inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that eliminates curcumin, increasing its bioavailability by up to 2,000%."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 7 found that high fiber intake (30g+/day) was associated with which specific clinical outcome regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP)?",
            "options": ["A 5% increase in CRP", "A 25-30% reduction in CRP levels", "No measurable change in CRP", "A 100% elimination of CRP"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Higher fiber intake promotes short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the gut, which is strongly linked to a 25-30% reduction in serum CRP, a key marker of systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Anthocyanins, the pigments found in berries, primarily protect against oxidative stress by activating which cellular defense pathway?",
            "options": ["The Nrf2 signaling pathway", "The Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) pathway", "The Sodium-Potassium pump", "The Glycolytic pathway"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anthocyanins trigger the Nrf2 pathway, which induces the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which enzyme is responsible for converting the plant-based ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid) into the anti-inflammatory EPA, and can be inhibited by excessive intake of linoleic acid?",
            "options": ["Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)", "Delta-6 desaturase", "Amylase", "Lipoprotein lipase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Delta-6 desaturase is the rate-limiting enzyme for converting ALA to EPA; because Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids compete for this enzyme, high Omega-6 intake reduces the conversion efficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) are pro-inflammatory compounds formed when proteins or fats combine with sugars. Which cooking method produces the HIGHEST level of AGEs?",
            "options": ["Steaming", "Boiling", "Poaching", "Dry-heat grilling"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "High-temperature, dry-heat methods like grilling, searing, and frying can increase the AGE content of foods by 10-100 times compared to moist-heat cooking."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Client Sarah' (Lesson 5), daily consumption of 1 cup of blueberries led to a significant improvement in which vascular marker?",
            "options": ["Total Body Water percentage", "Flow-mediated dilation (FMD)", "Visual acuity", "Bone mineral density"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blueberry consumption improves endothelial function, measured via flow-mediated dilation (FMD), due to the effect of anthocyanins on nitric oxide bioavailability."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which specific polyphenol found in grapes and Japanese knotweed is noted for its ability to mimic the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction?",
            "options": ["Resveratrol", "EGCG", "Genistein", "Lycopene"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Resveratrol activates sirtuins (specifically SIRT1), which are enzymes involved in longevity and the reduction of inflammation, similar to the effects seen in caloric restriction."
