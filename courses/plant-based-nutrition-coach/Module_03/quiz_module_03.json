            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which enzyme is responsible for maintaining the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, and how does a whole-food plant-based diet (WFPB) typically affect its activity?",
            "options": [
                "Telomerase; WFPB increases its activity, potentially slowing cellular aging.",
                "DNA Polymerase; WFPB inhibits its activity to prevent cancer.",
                "mTOR; WFPB increases its activity to promote rapid cell division.",
                "Sirtuin 1; WFPB decreases its activity to conserve energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research, most notably by Dr. Dean Ornish, has shown that a WFPB diet combined with lifestyle changes can increase telomerase activity, the enzyme that repairs and maintains telomeres, which are markers of biological age."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is a central regulator of cell growth. Which specific amino acid, found in significantly higher concentrations in animal proteins, is the primary nutritional trigger for mTORC1 activation?",
            "options": [
                "Glycine",
                "Leucine",
                "Tryptophan",
                "Proline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid that acts as a potent signaling molecule for mTORC1. Plant proteins generally contain lower levels of leucine compared to animal proteins, which helps avoid chronic over-activation of this pathway."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "AMPK is often referred to as the 'metabolic master switch.' What is the relationship between AMPK and mTOR in the context of longevity?",
            "options": [
                "AMPK and mTOR both promote cell growth and should be activated simultaneously.",
                "AMPK activation inhibits mTOR, shifting the cell from a 'growth' state to a 'maintenance and repair' state.",
                "mTOR activation triggers AMPK to increase fat storage.",
                "There is no functional relationship between AMPK and mTOR."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AMPK and mTOR have an antagonistic relationship. When energy is low (activated AMPK), the body shuts down the energy-intensive growth processes of mTOR to focus on cellular cleanup and survival."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A 2014 study by Levine et al. found that high protein intake (20%+ of calories) in middle-aged adults was associated with a 400% increase in cancer death risk. This risk was largely abolished if the protein was:",
            "options": [
                "Consumed only in the evening.",
                "Derived from plant sources.",
                "Paired with high-intensity interval training.",
                "Supplemented with Vitamin B12."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found that the association between high protein and increased IGF-1/cancer mortality was specific to animal protein; high plant protein intake did not show the same correlation with increased mortality."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Autophagy is the process of 'self-eating' where cells recycle damaged organelles. Which plant-derived compound is specifically noted for its ability to induce autophagy via the Nrf2 pathway?",
            "options": [
                "Sulforaphane (found in cruciferous vegetables)",
                "Beta-carotene (found in carrots)",
                "Lycopene (found in tomatoes)",
                "Starch (found in potatoes)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a potent isothiocyanate that activates the Nrf2 pathway, which in turn stimulates antioxidant production and autophagic clearance of cellular debris."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of proteins involved in DNA repair and longevity. What co-factor is essential for Sirtuin function, and which plant-based strategy helps maintain its levels?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C; high citrus consumption.",
                "NAD+; consuming precursors like Nicotinic Acid in whole grains and green vegetables.",
                "Calcium; consuming fortified plant milks.",
                "Iron; consuming lentils and spinach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Without sufficient NAD+, sirtuins cannot function. Plant-based diets provide the precursors and phytonutrients (like CD38 inhibitors) that help maintain NAD+ pools."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Okinawan Paradox,' how does nutrient density contribute to longevity despite lower caloric intake?",
            "options": [
                "High caloric intake is compensated for by high sugar consumption.",
                "The diet is low in calories but exceptionally high in phytochemicals and fiber, primarily from purple sweet potatoes.",
                "They consume high amounts of lard to ensure fat-soluble vitamin absorption.",
                "The population relies on synthetic supplements rather than whole foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The traditional Okinawan diet is characterized by 'Caloric Restriction with Optimal Nutrition' (CRON), where high nutrient density (from vegetables like the Beni Imo) prevents the malnutrition typically associated with low-calorie diets."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What is the 'SASP' (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype) and why is it detrimental to longevity?",
            "options": [
                "A beneficial protein that helps skin elasticity.",
                "A type of plant fiber that improves gut health.",
                "A cocktail of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by senescent 'zombie' cells that damages healthy neighboring cells.",
                "The process by which plants convert sunlight into energy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senescent cells (cells that stop dividing but don't die) secrete SASP, which creates a pro-inflammatory environment (inflammaging) that drives age-related diseases."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When coaching a client for longevity using the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™, what is the recommended approach to protein intake to balance muscle mass and mTOR regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic high-protein intake (3g/kg) regardless of activity level.",
                "Eliminating all protein to keep mTOR permanently suppressed.",
                "Protein 'pulsing' or cycling: higher intake around resistance training to support muscle, and lower intake at other times to allow for autophagy.",
                "Consuming only animal-based collagen for joint health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To optimize longevity, we want to avoid chronic mTOR activation. Pulsing protein intake provides the necessary stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS) when needed while allowing for periods of cellular repair (autophagy) during lower-intake windows."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "According to the Harvard Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n=121,700+), what was the observed effect of replacing 3% of calories from animal protein with plant protein?",
            "options": [
                "No significant change in mortality.",
                "A 10% reduction in overall mortality and a 12% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The data showed that even a small shift (3% of calories) from animal to plant protein sources resulted in significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality."
