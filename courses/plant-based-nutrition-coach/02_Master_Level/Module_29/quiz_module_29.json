            "options": [
                "Simply providing a meal plan based on caloric needs",
                "Aligning metabolic requirements with the client's psychosocial identity and environmental constraints",
                "Exclusively focusing on micronutrient density regardless of client preference",
                "Transitioning the client to a 100% raw food diet for maximum enzyme activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration involves more than just biology; it requires the synthesis of physiological needs (metabolic) with the client's lifestyle, psychology, and environment to ensure long-term success."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When managing a client with 'Multi-Morbidity' (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes and Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease), what is the primary consideration for plant-based protein sources?",
            "options": [
                "Maximal protein intake to prevent muscle wasting",
                "The phosphorus-to-protein ratio and the bioavailability of plant-based phosphorus",

                "Using only processed soy isolates to ensure complete amino acid profiles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In CKD, the source of phosphorus matters. Plant-based phosphorus (phytates) has lower bioavailability (30-50%) compared to animal-based or inorganic additives, allowing for better management of renal mineral metabolism."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Bio-individual optimization often involves looking at SNPs. A client with a variation in the PEMT gene may require higher intakes of which nutrient on a plant-based diet?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PEMT gene is involved in the endogenous production of phosphatidylcholine. Those with certain SNPs may have a higher dietary requirement for choline, which can be challenging on a poorly planned plant-based diet."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Identity Mapping allows clients to visualize and navigate how their dietary choices interact with their social life, reducing 'social friction' which is a leading cause of relapse."
