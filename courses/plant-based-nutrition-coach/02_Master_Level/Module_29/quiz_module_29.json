            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master-level optimization looks at the intersection of lifestyle and physiology; high cortisol and a plateau often indicate a 'stress-nutrient gap' where the body is in a protective metabolic state, requiring circadian alignment rather than more stress (exercise/restriction)."
