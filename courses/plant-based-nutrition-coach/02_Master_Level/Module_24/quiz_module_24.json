            "question": "A client presents with 'normal' serum B12 levels (350 pg/mL) but exhibits neurological symptoms and fatigue. Which biomarker is the most sensitive 'gold standard' for identifying functional B12 deficiency in this plant-based client?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Folate",
                "Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)",
                "Hemoglobin A1c",
                "Total Bilirubin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serum B12 can often show false normals. MMA is a functional marker that rises when B12 is insufficient at the cellular level, making it the most sensitive indicator for plant-based practitioners to monitor."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Psychological Resilience and the Plant-Based Identity,' what does the term 'Social Identity Conflict' specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The physiological craving for animal products during the first 30 days.",
                "The cognitive dissonance felt when eating a meal that contains honey.",
                "The stress resulting from a misalignment between a client's new plant-based values and their existing social circles or family traditions.",
                "The inability to find plant-based options in a rural environment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social Identity Conflict occurs when a client's transition to a plant-based identity creates friction with their established social groups, often requiring specific resilience strategies to maintain long-term adherence."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Within the P.L.A.N.T.™ clinical framework, the 'N' stands for 'Nutrient-Density Optimization.' What is the primary focus of this stage when reversing chronic disease?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in P.L.A.N.T.™ emphasizes high-nutrient-density whole foods to flood the body with phytochemicals and antioxidants necessary for cellular repair and disease reversal."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Research from the American Gut Project (n=10,000+) indicates that the single greatest predictor of microbial diversity is the consumption of how many different plant species per week?",
            "options": [
                "At least 10",
                "At least 20",
                "At least 30",
                "At least 50"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that individuals who ate 30 or more different types of plant foods per week had significantly more diverse microbiomes and lower antibiotic resistance genes than those who ate 10 or fewer."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A client has a 'CC' genotype for the FADS1 gene (rs174537), indicating a 'slow converter' phenotype. What precision nutrition intervention is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increase intake of Flaxseeds and Chia seeds to 4 tablespoons daily.",

                "Eliminating all omega-3 sources to prevent oxidative stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FADS1 'slow converter' genotype results in poor conversion of ALA (from seeds) to long-chain EPA/DHA. Direct algae-based supplementation ensures adequate omega-3 status regardless of genetic limitations."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "To optimize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a master-level plant-based athlete, what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine is required per meal to 'trigger' the mTOR pathway for muscle protein synthesis, which may require combining specific plant proteins (e.g., soy or pea/rice blends)."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "According to circadian biology, how does 'Early Time-Restricted Feeding' (eTRF) impact insulin sensitivity compared to late-window feeding?",
            "options": [
                "It has no measurable effect on insulin sensitivity.",
                "It significantly improves insulin sensitivity and lowers 24-hour mean glucose levels.",
                "It decreases insulin sensitivity by stressing the pancreas in the morning.",
                "It only works if the client consumes more than 200g of protein."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "eTRF (e.g., eating 8am-4pm) aligns with the body's natural circadian rhythm of insulin sensitivity, which is highest in the morning and declines in the evening."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "A client with diagnosed Stage 2 Hypertension asks you to help them transition to a plant-based diet to get off their medication. What is the ethically correct 'Scope of Practice' action?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client to stop their medication immediately as the diet will work within 48 hours.",
                "Interpret their last 5 years of medical records and provide a new diagnosis.",
                "Support the dietary transition while insisting the client coordinates all medication adjustments with their prescribing physician.",
                "Refuse to work with the client because they have a medical condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners must never adjust or advise on medication. The role is to provide nutritional support while the client's physician manages medical supervision and de-prescribing."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "Which specific fiber-derived metabolite is primarily responsible for maintaining the integrity of the 'tight junctions' in the gut lining (preventing 'leaky gut')?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel source for colonocytes and is critical for maintaining the mucosal barrier and the tight junction proteins that prevent intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "In the 'Clinical Application' of reversing Type 2 Diabetes, which biomarker change is typically observed first after 7-14 days on a low-fat, whole-food plant-based (WFPB) protocol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While HbA1c takes 3 months to reflect change, fasting blood glucose and insulin sensitivity often improve within the first 1-2 weeks due to the reduction of intramyocellular lipids (fat inside muscle cells)."
