            "question": "When transitioning a plant-based infant to solid foods at approximately 6 months, which nutrient is of highest priority due to the depletion of hepatic stores and low concentrations in breast milk?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K",
                "Iron",
                "Calcium",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By 6 months of age, an infant's prenatal iron stores are largely depleted. Since breast milk is naturally low in iron, the introduction of iron-rich plant foods (like fortified cereals or pureed lentils) is critical for neurological development."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "To effectively stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) and counteract sarcopenia in geriatric patients (65+), what is the evidence-based protein recommendation per meal?",
            "options": [
                "0.15 - 0.20 g/kg body weight",
                "0.25 - 0.30 g/kg body weight",

                "0.80 - 1.0 g/kg body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Older adults exhibit 'anabolic resistance,' requiring a higher leucine threshold and a larger bolus of protein (0.4-0.6g/kg per meal) compared to younger adults to trigger the same muscle-building response."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In elite athletic periodization, what is the primary physiological mechanism by which dietary nitrates (found in arugula and beets) enhance performance?",

                "Immediate buffering of lactic acid in the blood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which improves mitochondrial efficiency and reduces the oxygen cost of exercise, allowing athletes to perform at a higher intensity for longer durations."

                "Chromium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Choline requirements increase during pregnancy (450mg) and lactation (550mg). While found in soy and cruciferous vegetables, many plant-based pregnant women benefit from targeted supplementation to ensure fetal brain health."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Clinical trials on Type 2 Diabetes reversal demonstrate that a low-fat, whole-food plant-based diet improves insulin sensitivity primarily by reducing which of the following?",

                "Total caloric expenditure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intramyocellular lipids interfere with the insulin signaling pathway (GLUT4 translocation). Reducing dietary fat and focusing on fiber-rich plants clears this 'cellular sludge,' restoring insulin sensitivity."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In the management of autoimmune conditions, which short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced by fiber fermentation is most critical for inducing Treg cells and maintaining the gut mucosal barrier?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel for colonocytes and plays a major role in immune tolerance by inducing the production of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which help prevent the immune system from attacking body tissues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orthorexia is characterized by a pathological obsession with 'pure' eating, where deviations from self-imposed dietary rules result in significant psychological distress or social isolation."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "When adapting plant-based nutrition for populations facing food insecurity, the 'Complementary Protein' strategy (e.g., rice and beans) is used to ensure the intake of which limiting amino acid in grains?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grains are typically low in lysine but high in methionine, while legumes are high in lysine but low in methionine. Combining them ensures a complete amino acid profile in resource-poor settings."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "To maximize glycogen resynthesis after an exhaustive 2-hour training session, a plant-based athlete should consume carbohydrates at what rate during the 'anabolic window'?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-exercise glycogen resynthesis is maximized by consuming 1.0 - 1.2g of carbohydrates per kg of body weight per hour for the first 4 hours following glycogen-depleting exercise."
