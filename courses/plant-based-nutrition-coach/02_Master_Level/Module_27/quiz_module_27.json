            "question": "According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, what is the primary concern for vegan infants transitioning to solid foods (6-12 months)?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive protein intake leading to kidney strain",
                "Inadequate energy density and micronutrient bioavailability (Iron/Zinc)",
                "Over-consumption of fiber leading to mineral malabsorption",
                "Insufficient intake of Vitamin C to support collagen synthesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While plant-based diets are safe, infants have high caloric needs and small stomach capacities. Ensuring energy density (through healthy fats) and bioavailable sources of Iron and Zinc is critical during the weaning phase."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "To overcome the 'anabolic resistance' associated with sarcopenia in geriatric patients, what is the recommended per-meal Leucine threshold to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams per meal",
                "1.2 - 1.5 grams per meal",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams per meal",
                "5.0 - 7.0 grams per meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that older adults require a higher leucine threshold (approx. 2.5-3.0g) per meal to overcome anabolic resistance and effectively stimulate muscle protein synthesis compared to younger populations."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In elite plant-based athletic periodization, why might a coach recommend 'Training Low' (low carbohydrate availability) during specific base-phase sessions?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Training in a low-carbohydrate state (periodized nutrition) can enhance adaptive responses like mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, though it should be alternated with 'High' days for performance."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, by approximately how many additional calories per day should a plant-based mother increase her intake?",
            "options": [
                "100 and 200 kcal respectively",
                "340 and 450 kcal respectively",
                "500 and 800 kcal respectively",
                "No increase is needed if nutrient density is high"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines suggest an additional ~340 kcal/day in the second trimester and ~450 kcal/day in the third trimester to support fetal growth and maternal tissue expansion."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "What physiological mechanism explains why a low-fat, whole-food plant-based diet (WFPB) improves insulin sensitivity in Type 2 Diabetes patients?",
            "options": [
                "Reduction of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL), which restores the insulin signaling pathway",
                "Complete elimination of glucose from the bloodstream",
                "Increasing the thickness of the intestinal mucosal layer to block sugar absorption",
                "The 'alkalizing' effect of greens neutralizing pancreatic acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "WFPB diets reduce 'fat inside the muscle cells' (intramyocellular lipids). High levels of IMCL interfere with the insulin signaling process; reducing them allows GLUT4 transporters to migrate to the cell surface effectively."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In the context of autoimmune conditions, how does dietary fiber support gut mucosal integrity?",
            "options": [
                "By physically scrubbing the intestinal walls of toxins",
                "Through the production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like Butyrate, which induce T-regulatory cells",
                "By binding to antibodies and preventing them from attacking the thyroid",
                "By reducing the pH of the stomach to kill all intestinal bacteria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fiber fermentation by gut microbiota produces SCFAs, particularly butyrate. Butyrate is a primary energy source for colonocytes and promotes the differentiation of T-regulatory cells, which help suppress inappropriate immune responses."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark 'red flag' for Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) in a plant-based client?",
            "options": [

                "Taking a B12 supplement as recommended by health organizations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While healthy eating is positive, Orthorexia is characterized by an obsessive fixation on food 'purity' that leads to significant psychological distress, malnutrition, or social impairment."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "The 'Double Burden of Malnutrition' in global food security contexts refers to:",
            "options": [
                "Having both Vitamin A and Vitamin D deficiencies simultaneously",
                "The coexistence of undernutrition (stunting/wasting) and overnutrition (obesity) within the same community or household",
                "The requirement to produce twice as much food for plant-based populations",
                "The economic cost of importing food vs. growing it locally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Double Burden' is a phenomenon where undernutrition and obesity exist side-by-side, often due to the high availability of nutrient-poor, energy-dense processed foods in developing economies."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A client with an autoimmune condition shows elevated levels of Zonulin. What does this biomarker typically indicate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract wall. Elevated levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "To maximize the ergogenic benefits of dietary nitrates (e.g., beetroot juice), when should an athlete consume them relative to competition?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately (5 minutes) before the event",
                "2-3 hours before the event to allow for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by oral bacteria",
                "Exactly 24 hours before the event only",
                "During the event, sipped slowly to maintain blood glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nitrate conversion requires time for the 'enterosalivary circulation' process. Peak nitrite levels in the blood typically occur 2-3 hours after ingestion of nitrate-rich foods."
