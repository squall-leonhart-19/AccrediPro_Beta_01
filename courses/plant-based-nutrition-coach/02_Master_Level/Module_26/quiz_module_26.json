            "question": "In the 'Tiered Coaching Architecture' model, what is the primary differentiator of an 'Advanced' tier compared to a 'Foundational' tier?",
            "options": [
                "The removal of all processed foods from the meal plan.",
                "Increased frequency of high-touch clinical monitoring and bio-individualized adjustments.",
                "Access to basic grocery shopping lists and generic recipes.",
                "The requirement of a 12-month minimum commitment."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced tiers focus on high-touch support, including frequent check-ins and bio-individualized data analysis (like lab work review), whereas foundational tiers often rely on self-paced or group-based delivery."

            "question": "According to the P.L.A.N.T. Method™ for curriculum mapping, what does the 'A' (Adapt) phase specifically address?",

                "Acclimatizing the client to a higher caloric intake.",
                "Assessing the client's current kitchen equipment.",
                "Adjusting protocols based on metabolic feedback and lifestyle barriers.",
                "Allocating specific protein targets for athletic performance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Adapt' phase is critical for long-term adherence, focusing on modifying the program based on the client's physiological response and practical real-world challenges."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During a 'Kitchen Audit,' the 'Traffic Light System' is used to organize the environment. Which of the following best describes the 'Yellow Light' category?",
            "options": [
                "Whole, unprocessed plant foods to be eaten in abundance.",
                "Highly processed foods containing trans-fats and refined sugars.",
                "Minimally processed foods (e.g., canned beans, whole grain pasta) to be used with intention.",
                "Foods that must be discarded immediately due to high sodium content."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Yellow light foods are 'proceed with caution' items—minimally processed staples that provide convenience but should be used purposefully within a WFPB framework."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When monitoring a client transitioning to a strict WFPB diet, why is it critical to track Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) in addition to serum B12?",
            "options": [
                "Serum B12 levels can be falsely elevated by high intake of seaweed or fermented foods.",
                "MMA is a more accurate reflection of iron storage than ferritin.",
                "MMA levels track the absorption of Vitamin D3 more effectively.",
                "Serum B12 only measures protein-bound B12, which is irrelevant to nerve health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Serum B12 can show 'false normals' if a client consumes inactive B12 analogues (found in some seaweeds). MMA is a functional marker that rises when B12 is truly deficient at the cellular level."

                "Higher than 20:1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that reducing the ratio to between 2:1 and 4:1 significantly decreases systemic inflammation and lowers High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (HS-CRP)."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A client presents with significant bloating when increasing fiber. According to the Fiber Titration Protocol, what is the recommended weekly increase in fiber intake?",
            "options": [
                "15-20 grams per week until the target is reached.",
                "3-5 grams per week, accompanied by a 10-15% increase in water intake.",
                "Fiber should be doubled every 3 days to force microbiome adaptation.",
                "Fiber should not be increased; the client should remain on a low-fiber diet indefinitely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow titration (3-5g per week) allows the gut microbiome to shift and the enzymatic capacity to increase without causing severe gastrointestinal distress."

                "The Trans-Theoretical Model"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking (e.g., 'After I pour my morning coffee, I will take my B12 supplement') uses the neural pathways of existing habits to anchor new ones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis cited in the module showed that 'Implementation Intentions' (If-Then planning) increased dietary adherence by what percentage compared to standard goal setting?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%",
                "Approximately 28%",

                "Approximately 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that 'If-Then' planning (e.g., 'If I am at a restaurant, then I will ask for a side of steamed greens') increases adherence by roughly 28% over simple goal setting."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "When evaluating program success using KPIs, which metric is considered a 'Leading Indicator' of long-term weight maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "Total pounds lost in the first 30 days.",
                "The number of weekly meals prepared at home (Kitchen Competency).",
                "The client's final BMI at 6 months.",
                "Total reduction in serum cholesterol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leading indicators are predictive behaviors. Kitchen competency (preparing meals at home) is a behavior that predicts future success, whereas weight loss is a 'lagging indicator' (the result)."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "A client with Type 2 Diabetes is starting the 'Therapeutic Anti-Inflammatory Track.' Which clinical marker should be monitored most closely for rapid improvement within the first 2-4 weeks?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While HbA1c takes 3 months to reflect change, postprandial glucose and insulin sensitivity often improve within days or weeks on a high-fiber, low-fat WFPB diet."
