            "question": "During an Advanced Kitchen Audit (L3), a coach identifies 'Natural Flavors' in a client's vegetable broth. Why is this a point of clinical scrutiny in a strict plant-based program?",
            "options": [
                "Natural flavors are always derived from meat",
                "They may contain hidden animal-derived compounds or high concentrations of MSG",

                "They increase the glycemic index of the meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a clinical or strict plant-based context, 'natural flavors' can be an umbrella term for various additives, including those derived from animal sources or excitotoxins like MSG, which may interfere with clean-label goals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that adding 20mg of piperine to 2g of curcumin enhances bioavailability by 2,000% by inhibiting the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that otherwise eliminates curcumin rapidly."

            "question": "A client experiences significant bloating after increasing daily fiber from 15g to 40g in one week. According to the Fiber Titration Protocol (L6), what is the recommended rate of increase?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To allow the microbiome to adapt without significant GI distress, fiber should be increased gradually at a rate of 5g per week, ensuring hydration is scaled simultaneously to facilitate transit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choice architecture involves organizing the environment to make the desired behavior the easiest choice. Eye-level placement of healthy foods reduces the friction of decision-making."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While satisfaction is important, clinical efficacy is best measured by objective outcomes, such as the percentage of the cohort reaching specific biomarker targets (like LDL cholesterol reduction)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In plant-based nutrition, non-heme iron absorption is sensitive to inhibitors (phytates/tannins) and enhancers (Vitamin C). Assessing the timing of tea/coffee and increasing Vitamin C is the standard corrective protocol."
