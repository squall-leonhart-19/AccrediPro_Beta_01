            "question": "A client presenting with unexplained weight loss of 12% over 8 weeks, persistent nocturnal diarrhea, and localized abdominal pain should be handled via which protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate transition to a low-FODMAP plant-based diet",
                "High-calorie liquid supplementation and fiber reduction",
                "Immediate clinical referral as these are 'Red Flag' symptoms",
                "Increasing probiotic-rich fermented foods to restore the microbiome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unexplained weight loss (>5% in a month), nocturnal diarrhea, and localized pain are clinical 'Red Flags' indicating potential malignancy or severe IBD, requiring immediate medical evaluation before nutritional intervention."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In cases of severe Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis and fiber intolerance (e.g., SIBO), what is the recommended 'Step 1' intervention for a plant-based client?",
            "options": [
                "A high-fiber 'sweep' using psyllium husk and raw cruciferous vegetables",
                "A temporary low-FODMAP plant-based protocol for 2-6 weeks to reduce fermentable substrates",
                "The permanent removal of all legumes and whole grains from the diet",
                "A 48-hour water fast followed by high-dose prebiotic supplementation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A temporary (2-6 week) low-FODMAP approach reduces the fermentable substrates that exacerbate SIBO symptoms, allowing for symptomatic relief while the underlying cause is addressed."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'Gold Standard' for assessing functional Vitamin B12 deficiency in a client with malabsorption syndrome, even if serum B12 appears normal?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Cobalamin",
                "Hemoglobin and Hematocrit",

                "Serum Folate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a specific functional marker; elevated levels indicate a cellular B12 deficiency even when serum levels are within the 'low-normal' range."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orthorexia is characterized by an obsession with food quality/purity that leads to significant psychological distress, social isolation, or physical malnutrition."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A client with Stage 4 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) wants to maintain a plant-based diet. Which strategy is most effective for reducing the potassium content of high-potassium vegetables like potatoes?",
            "options": [
                "Dehydrating the vegetables at low temperatures",
                "Leaching (peeling, slicing, and soaking) followed by boiling in a large volume of water",
                "Steaming the vegetables to preserve micronutrients",
                "Consuming them raw to avoid heat-induced chemical changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leaching followed by boiling can reduce potassium content by up to 50-70%, making high-potassium vegetables safer for patients with advanced renal insufficiency."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "Which medication interaction requires a client to maintain consistent intake of Vitamin K-rich greens (like kale and spinach) rather than fluctuating or suddenly increasing intake?",
            "options": [
                "Levothyroxine (Thyroid hormone)",
                "Warfarin (Anticoagulant)",
                "Metformin (Antidiabetic)",
                "Atorvastatin (Cholesterol-lowering)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Warfarin works by inhibiting Vitamin K. Sudden increases in Vitamin K intake can 'override' the medication, while consistency allows the physician to dose the medication accurately around the diet."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In 'Failure to Thrive' (FTT) cases involving rapid weight loss, what is the primary goal of the 'Caloric Density Shift'?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the volume of food to stretch the stomach",
                "Reducing fat intake to improve insulin sensitivity",

                "Switching to an all-raw diet to maximize enzyme intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For FTT, the focus is on maximizing calories per bite. Large volumes of low-calorie fiber cause premature satiety, making it difficult for the client to meet their energy needs."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "For a client with Hepatic Insufficiency and Hepatic Encephalopathy, why is vegetable protein often preferred over animal-based protein?",
            "options": [
                "Vegetable protein contains more saturated fat",
                "Vegetable protein has a higher ratio of Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) to Aromatic Amino Acids (AAA)",
                "Vegetable protein is harder to digest, slowing ammonia production",
                "Vegetable protein contains higher levels of methionine and ammonia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant proteins have a more favorable BCAA-to-AAA ratio and contain fiber, which helps facilitate nitrogen excretion in the stool, reducing the risk of ammonia buildup in the brain."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client with malabsorption (Crohn's in remission) is struggling with non-heme iron absorption. According to clinical data, adding 75mg of Vitamin C to a meal can increase iron absorption by approximately how much?",
            "options": [
                "It has no significant effect on non-heme iron",
                "It increases absorption by roughly 10-15%",
                "It can increase absorption by 3 to 4-fold",
                "It decreases absorption by competing for transporters"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron; studies show it can increase absorption 3-6 times by reducing ferric iron to the more absorbable ferrous state."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach's role is adherence support, education, and behavioral strategy within the scope of the treatment plan designed by the medical/clinical team (MD/RD)."
