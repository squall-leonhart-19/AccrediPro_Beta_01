            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid, unintentional weight loss (>10% in 90 days) is a clinical red flag for underlying pathologies such as malignancy, hyperthyroidism, or severe malabsorption, requiring medical clearance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Low-Fermentation phase reduces the substrate available for bacterial fermentation, which decreases gas production and luminal pressure, allowing the gut lining to repair."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When active transport in the ileum is compromised, high-dose oral supplementation can still achieve adequate levels through passive diffusion (roughly 1% absorption rate), though sublingual or IM routes may be preferred."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K is the functional antagonist to Warfarin. Sudden increases in Vitamin K intake can decrease the drug's efficacy, requiring careful monitoring of the International Normalized Ratio (INR)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant-based proteins have a more favorable BCAA-to-AAA ratio and provide fiber that aids in the excretion of nitrogenous waste (ammonia), reducing the risk of hepatic encephalopathy."
