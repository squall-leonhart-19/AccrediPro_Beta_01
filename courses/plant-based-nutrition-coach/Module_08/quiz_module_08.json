            "question": "In the P.L.A.N.T. Kitchen framework for advanced meal architecture, what does the 'A' represent and why is it prioritized?",
            "options": [
                "Acidity; to balance the pH of the digestive tract",
                "Aromatics; to enhance sensory satisfaction and provide medicinal phytochemicals",
                "Amino Acids; to ensure all nine essential aminos are present in every bite",
                "Antioxidants; specifically to prevent lipid peroxidation during cooking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aromatics (onions, garlic, ginger, etc.) are the foundation of the P.L.A.N.T. framework because they provide both deep flavor profiles (increasing satiety) and potent organosulfur compounds and anti-inflammatory properties."

            "question": "According to the Bioavailability Mastery lesson, adding 75mg of Vitamin C (roughly one large orange) to a plant-based meal can increase non-heme iron absorption by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "50-75%",
                "100-150%",

                "500-600%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that 75-100mg of Vitamin C can increase the absorption of non-heme iron by 3 to 4 times (200-300%), effectively overcoming the inhibitory effects of phytates."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Piperine inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation in the liver) that normally eliminates curcumin, resulting in a 2,000% increase in bioavailability as demonstrated in human pharmacokinetic studies."

                "50 species"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The '30 plants per week' benchmark is a key clinical target for maximizing the diversity of the microbiome and the production of health-promoting Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "To optimize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a plant-based athlete, what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal to compensate for the lower leucine content in many plant proteins?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 - 1.5 grams",

                "10.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While animal proteins are naturally higher in leucine, plant-based athletes can trigger MPS effectively by hitting a 'leucine threshold' of roughly 2.5-3.0g per meal through varied protein sources or concentrated plant isolates."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While ALA is found in flax/walnuts, the conversion rate to DHA is often insufficient (typically <5%) to meet the high neurological demands of a developing fetus, making algae-derived DHA a primary recommendation."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "The 'Second Meal Effect' (metabolic optimization) refers to the phenomenon where consuming legumes at breakfast improves glycemic control at lunch. What is the primary mechanism behind this?",
            "options": [
                "The high fat content slows gastric emptying for 8+ hours",
                "Phytic acid prevents all carbohydrate absorption at the second meal",
                "Fermentation of prebiotic fibers in the colon produces SCFAs that improve systemic insulin sensitivity",
                "Legumes contain natural insulin-mimetic peptides that stay in the blood for 12 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Second Meal Effect' is largely mediated by the fermentation of resistant starch and oligosaccharides in legumes, which produces Short-Chain Fatty Acids that signal the liver to reduce glucose output and improve insulin sensitivity hours later."

            "question": "To maximize the formation of Sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables, which 'hack' should a coach recommend if the client prefers to cook (boil/steam) their broccoli?",
            "options": [
                "Adding mustard seed powder (rich in myrosinase) after cooking",
                "Adding extra virgin olive oil to the boiling water",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Heat destroys the enzyme myrosinase, which is required to convert glucoraphanin into sulforaphane. Adding a raw source of myrosinase, like mustard seed powder or raw arugula, to cooked crucifers restores this conversion process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews show that nitrate supplementation (via beetroot juice) can reduce the oxygen cost of exercise by 5-10%, allowing athletes to perform at a higher intensity for longer durations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Crowding Out' principle focuses on inclusion (adding nutrient-dense, high-satiety foods) which naturally displaces less-healthful options, reducing feelings of deprivation and increasing long-term adherence."
