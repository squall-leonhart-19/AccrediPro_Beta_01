            "question": "In the context of amino acid complementarity, which 'limiting amino acid' is typically found in grains like rice and wheat, but is abundant in legumes?",
            "options": [
                "Methionine",
                "Lysine",
                "Leucine",
                "Valine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grains are typically low in the essential amino acid Lysine. Legumes are rich in Lysine but low in Methionine, making them ideal complementary protein sources."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "To optimize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a single meal, research suggests a 'Leucine Threshold' must be met. What is the generally accepted target for leucine per meal for athletes?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.2 - 1.8 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "5.0 - 7.5 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine are required to maximally trigger the mTOR pathway and initiate Muscle Protein Synthesis, which may require larger servings of plant proteins compared to whey."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the evidence discussed in Lesson 3, what is the recommended protein intake range for strength and endurance athletes?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 2.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "2.5 - 3.5 g/kg of body weight",
                "Exactly 1.6 g/kg for all individuals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the RDA is 0.8 g/kg, athletes require significantly more to maintain positive nitrogen balance, with 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg being the evidence-based range for performance and recovery."

            "question": "Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding creatine supplementation in plant-based athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Plant-based athletes naturally have higher intramuscular creatine stores than omnivores.",
                "Creatine is only found in significant amounts in plant foods like beets and spinach.",
                "Plant-based athletes often show a greater relative increase in muscle creatine levels upon supplementation compared to omnivores.",
                "Creatine supplementation is ineffective for those who do not consume red meat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because plant-based diets contain virtually no pre-formed creatine, vegans typically have lower baseline stores and therefore experience a more significant ergogenic response when supplementing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that have been shown in numerous meta-analyses to reduce markers of muscle damage and oxidative stress following intense exercise."

            "options": [
                "3-5 g/kg of body weight",
                "6-8 g/kg of body weight",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maximize glycogen supercompensation, athletes are encouraged to consume 10-12 g/kg of body weight of carbohydrates in the 36-48 hours leading up to an event."

            "options": [
                "Lack of complex carbohydrates; managed by eating more fruit.",
                "Excessive dietary fiber causing premature satiety; managed by incorporating refined grains and liquid calories.",
                "Too much leucine intake; managed by avoiding soy.",
                "Low nitrogen levels; managed by reducing water intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The high fiber content of whole plant foods can cause athletes to feel full before they meet their high caloric requirements. Using lower-fiber options like white rice, pasta, or smoothies helps meet energy demands."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, Beta-alanine is discussed as a precursor to which intracellular buffer that helps maintain muscle pH during high-intensity exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Glutathione",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-alanine is the rate-limiting precursor to carnosine. Supplementation increases muscle carnosine levels, which helps buffer the hydrogen ions (acidity) produced during anaerobic exercise."

            "question": "A 2023 study compared mycoprotein (fungi-derived) to milk protein regarding MPS. What was the primary finding relevant to plant-based coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Mycoprotein was unable to stimulate MPS.",
                "Mycoprotein resulted in significantly lower MPS than milk protein.",
                "Mycoprotein was found to be just as effective, if not more effective, than milk protein at stimulating MPS when leucine was matched.",
                "Mycoprotein caused digestive distress in 90% of participants."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recent research has shown that high-quality plant/fungal proteins like mycoprotein can stimulate muscle protein synthesis as effectively as animal-derived proteins when consumed in sufficient quantities."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "When calculating protein needs for a plant-based athlete, why might a coach recommend a 10% increase over standard recommendations?",
            "options": [
                "To account for the 'Thermic Effect of Food' (TEF) which is higher in plants.",
                "To compensate for lower digestibility and the presence of anti-nutrients like phytates and oxalates in some plant sources.",
                "Because plant-based athletes have a faster metabolism.",
                "To prevent the conversion of protein into body fat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to the slightly lower digestibility of some plant proteins (explained by PDCAAS/DIAAS scores), a 10% 'safety margin' ensures the athlete absorbs an adequate amount of essential amino acids."
