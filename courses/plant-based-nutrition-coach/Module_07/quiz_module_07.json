            "question": "According to the psychological principles discussed in Lesson 1, what phenomenon occurs when a client experiences mental discomfort because their behavior (consuming animal products) conflicts with their new values (animal welfare or health)?",
            "options": [
                "Cognitive Dissonance",
                "Confirmation Bias",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Dissonance is the psychological stress experienced by a person who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. In plant-based coaching, resolving this dissonance is key to shifting identity and behavior."

            "options": [
                "Using willpower to ignore the craving entirely",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 teaches that habits are best modified by keeping the cue and the reward similar but changing the 'Response' (the behavior itself) to a more health-aligned action."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proactive communication (24-48 hours) combined with the offer to contribute a dish (the 'Contribution Strategy') reduces host stress and ensures the client has a nutrient-dense option."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sensory-specific satiety refers to the decline in pleasure derived from a specific food as it is consumed. Diverse textures and flavors in plant-based meals prevent boredom and increase the 'pleasure' aspect of satiety."

                "External Regulation (e.g., following the diet because a doctor ordered it)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrated regulation occurs when the behavior is fully assimilated into the person's self-identity. This internal drive is far more sustainable than external pressures or temporary goals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Human metabolism follows a circadian rhythm where insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are higher in the morning. Consuming carbohydrates (even complex ones) late at night can lead to higher glucose spikes."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE) occurs when a 'slip' leads to feelings of guilt and loss of control, causing the individual to abandon their dietary goals entirely for a period."

                "If I eat a snack, I will make sure it is a plant-based snack."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective Implementation Intentions must be specific, include a clear cue (9:00 PM/urge to snack), and provide a concrete alternative action (water/breathing) rather than just a vague goal."
