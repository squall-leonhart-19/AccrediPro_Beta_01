            "question": "According to the Bioavailability Matrix (L1), which combination results in the highest fractional absorption of non-heme iron?",
            "options": [
                "Lentils consumed with a cup of black tea",
                "Chickpeas consumed with 75mg of Vitamin C (e.g., bell peppers)",
                "Spinach consumed with high-calcium almond milk",
                "Whole grain bread consumed with raw wheat bran"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is the most potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption, capable of overcoming the inhibitory effects of phytates and polyphenols by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous form."

        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Bone Health), why is the calcium bioavailability from spinach (approx. 5%) significantly lower than that of bok choy (approx. 50%)?",
            "options": [
                "Spinach contains high levels of phytates",
                "Bok choy contains more Vitamin D3",
                "Spinach has a high concentration of oxalic acid which binds calcium",
                "Bok choy has a unique peptide that transports calcium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxalic acid (oxalates) in spinach forms insoluble calcium oxalate crystals in the gut, preventing absorption. Low-oxalate cruciferous vegetables like bok choy and kale offer much higher bioavailability."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the 'Phytochemical Frontier.' By what percentage does the addition of piperine (from black pepper) increase the bioavailability of curcumin?",

                "200%",
                "1000%",
                "2000%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that piperine inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that eliminates curcumin, increasing its bioavailability by up to 2,000%."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Regarding Microbiome Mapping (L4), which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is the primary fuel source for colonocytes and plays a critical role in maintaining gut barrier integrity?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred energy source for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes) and is essential for gene expression related to the gut barrier and anti-inflammatory pathways."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 (Metabolic Health), what is the primary mechanism by which soluble fiber improves insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "It directly stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin",
                "It forms a viscous gel that slows gastric emptying and glucose absorption",
                "It breaks down glucose molecules in the stomach",
                "It increases the acidity of the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soluble fiber creates a viscous gel-like matrix that delays the rate of gastric emptying and slows the diffusion of glucose to the absorptive surface of the small intestine, flattening the postprandial glucose curve."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 6 (Sports Nutrition), what is the 'Leucine Threshold' typically required to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a single meal for most adults?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The leucine trigger/threshold is generally cited between 2.5 and 3.0 grams of leucine per meal. Plant-based athletes often need slightly higher total protein intakes to reach this threshold due to lower leucine concentrations in individual plant sources."

            "question": "Lesson 7 covers Hormonal Harmony. Why are soy isoflavones considered 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators' (SERMs)?",
            "options": [
                "They only bind to estrogen receptors in the liver",
                "They have a higher affinity for ER-beta receptors than ER-alpha receptors",
                "They completely block all estrogen production in the body",
                "They convert testosterone into estrogen via aromatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Soy isoflavones like genistein and daidzein preferentially bind to Estrogen Receptor Beta (ER-β), which is associated with anti-proliferative effects, rather than ER-alpha (ER-α), which is associated with cell growth in breast and uterine tissue."

                "Myrosinase",
                "Protease",
                "Lipase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myrosinase is the enzyme that converts glucoraphanin into sulforaphane. It is heat-sensitive; chopping the vegetable and waiting 40 minutes allows the enzyme to create sulforaphane before it is deactivated by cooking."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, Vitamin K2 (specifically the MK-7 form) activates osteocalcin, the protein responsible for binding calcium to the bone mineral matrix."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client is looking to improve cardiovascular endurance via dietary nitrates (L6). Which food and timing protocol is most supported by the 'Kinetics & Performance' data?",
            "options": [
                "Eating raw spinach 10 minutes before a race",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plasma nitrite levels peak approximately 2-3 hours after the ingestion of nitrate-rich foods like beetroot juice. This timing aligns with the maximum improvement in mitochondrial efficiency and exercise performance."
