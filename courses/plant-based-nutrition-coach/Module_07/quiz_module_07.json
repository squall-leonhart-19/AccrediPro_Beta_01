            "question": "According to the Bioavailability Matrix (L1), adding 75mg of Vitamin C to a meal containing non-heme iron can increase iron absorption by approximately what factor?",
            "options": [
                "1.5x",
                "2x to 3x",
                "3x to 6x",
                "10x"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that adding 75mg of Vitamin C to a plant-based meal can increase non-heme iron absorption by 3 to 6 times, effectively overcoming the inhibitory effects of phytates and polyphenols."

            "question": "In the context of advanced bone health (L2), what is the primary physiological role of Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) compared to Vitamin K1?",
            "options": [
                "It primarily regulates blood clotting factors in the liver.",
                "It activates osteocalcin to bind calcium into the bone matrix and prevents vascular calcification.",
                "It increases the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium via the TRPV6 channel.",
                "It reduces the excretion of magnesium through the renal system."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While K1 is largely used for coagulation, Vitamin K2 (MK-7) is essential for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, which anchors calcium to the bone, and Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), which prevents calcium buildup in the arteries."

            "question": "A client is cooking broccoli but wants to ensure maximum sulforaphane production (L3). If they choose to boil the broccoli, which 'culinary medicine' technique should they use to restore the heat-sensitive enzyme myrosinase?",
            "options": [
                "Add a squeeze of lemon juice after cooking.",
                "Add a pinch of ground mustard seed powder to the cooked dish.",
                "Soak the broccoli in salt water for 20 minutes before boiling.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boiling destroys myrosinase, the enzyme required to convert glucoraphanin into sulforaphane. Adding ground mustard seed (a cruciferous relative) provides a supplemental source of active myrosinase to the cooked vegetable."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 30+ different plant types per week is the 'magic number' for maximizing gut microbiome diversity and the production of beneficial SCFAs like butyrate."

            "options": [
                "It has no effect on the next day's glucose levels.",
                "It increases the glycemic response to breakfast due to 'carbohydrate loading'.",
                "It improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity at breakfast by slowing gastric emptying and modulating fermentation.",
                "It causes nocturnal hypoglycemia in most healthy adults."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The fermentation of soluble fiber from legumes produces SCFAs that improve insulin sensitivity and slow the absorption of carbohydrates during subsequent meals, even 12-14 hours later."

                "Nitrates do not affect oxygen cost; they only increase muscle mass."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have shown that nitrate-rich foods improve mitochondrial efficiency, reducing the oxygen cost of exercise by 5-10% and improving time-to-exhaustion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AGEs form during dry-heat cooking. Moist-heat methods (steaming, poaching) at lower temperatures, especially in the presence of an acidic medium like lemon juice or vinegar, can reduce AGE formation by up to 50%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maximize MPS, a meal must contain roughly 2.5 to 3.0 grams of the amino acid Leucine. Since plant proteins are often lower in leucine than whey, athletes may need to consume larger portions or blend protein sources (e.g., pea and rice)."
