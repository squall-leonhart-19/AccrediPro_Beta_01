            "question": "Which of the following represents the primary technical advantage of the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) over the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)?",
            "options": [
                "DIAAS measures amino acid disappearance at the end of the ileum rather than fecal digestibility.",
                "DIAAS allows for a maximum score of 1.0, preventing overestimation of high-quality proteins.",
                "DIAAS measures only the total nitrogen content rather than specific amino acid profiles.",
                "DIAAS is calculated using human subjects exclusively, whereas PDCAAS uses rat models."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "DIAAS is considered superior because it measures digestibility at the end of the small intestine (ileal), providing a more accurate reflection of amino acids absorbed for protein synthesis, whereas PDCAAS uses fecal digestibility which can be skewed by microbial metabolism in the large intestine."

            "question": "In the context of micronutrient synergy, adding 75mg of Vitamin C to a meal containing non-heme iron has been shown to increase iron absorption by approximately what factor?",
            "options": [
                "It has no significant effect on absorption.",
                "It increases absorption by roughly 20%.",
                "It increases absorption by 3 to 4 times.",
                "It doubles the absorption but only in those with iron-deficiency anemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data shows that Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption, potentially increasing it by 3-4 times by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous state and preventing the formation of insoluble iron complexes."

            "question": "According to the 'Intramyocellular Lipid' (IMCL) theory discussed in Lesson 3, how does a whole-food plant-based diet improve insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the amount of fat stored within muscle cells to be used for fuel.",
                "By reducing the accumulation of toxic fat metabolites in muscle cells that block the insulin signaling pathway.",
                "By eliminating glucose from the diet entirely to rest the pancreas.",
                "By increasing the thickness of the muscle cell wall to prevent insulin leakage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant-based diets low in saturated fat help reduce intramyocellular lipids (fat inside the muscle cells). These fats produce metabolites like diacylglycerol that interfere with the insulin signaling mechanism (GLUT4 translocation), so reducing them restores insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "To maximize the cellular defense benefits of sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables, what culinary technique is recommended to ensure the conversion of glucoraphanin?",
            "options": [
                "Boiling the vegetables for at least 20 minutes to soften the fibers.",
                "Adding a source of active myrosinase, such as mustard seed powder, to cooked crucifers.",
                "Microwaving the vegetables on high heat to activate heat-stable enzymes.",
                "Consuming the vegetables only in juice form to remove all insoluble fiber."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The enzyme myrosinase is required to convert glucoraphanin into the active compound sulforaphane. Myrosinase is heat-sensitive and often destroyed during cooking; adding raw mustard seed powder (which contains active myrosinase) to cooked vegetables restores this conversion process."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a scientifically backed benefit of 'anti-nutrients' like phytates (phytic acid) found in grains and legumes?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the glycemic index of foods, providing quick energy.",
                "They act as potent antioxidants and may inhibit the formation of kidney stones.",
                "They facilitate the absorption of calcium in the large intestine.",
                "They are the primary source of Vitamin B12 in a plant-based diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While often criticized, phytates have been shown in meta-analyses to act as antioxidants, reduce the risk of certain cancers, and significantly lower the risk of calcium oxalate kidney stones by inhibiting crystal formation."

            "question": "In the Plant-Based Gut-Brain Axis (Lesson 6), which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is primarily responsible for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and stimulating BDNF?",
            "options": [

                "Succinate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate, produced by the fermentation of fiber by gut bacteria, plays a crucial role in systemic health, including strengthening the blood-brain barrier and promoting the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which supports neuronal health."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "When applying Advanced Culinary Medicine, which combination of ingredients creates a 'flavor synergy' that maximizes Umami (savory) perception?",
            "options": [
                "Glutamate-rich foods (like tomatoes) combined with 5'-ribonucleotides (like dried mushrooms).",
                "Simple sugars combined with acidic vinegars.",
                "Capsaicin-heavy peppers combined with high-fat coconut milk.",
                "Tannin-rich tea combined with oxalic acid-rich spinach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Umami Synergy' occurs when glutamate-rich foods are paired with foods containing specific nucleotides (inosinate or guanylate). This combination can increase the perceived intensity of savory flavor by up to 8 times compared to either ingredient alone."

            "options": [
                "The metabolic surge that happens when a person eats a high-calorie meal after fasting.",
                "A cycle where a perceived lapse in a diet leads to a complete abandonment of dietary goals for the remainder of the day.",
                "The psychological benefit of 'cheat meals' in maintaining long-term metabolic flexibility.",
                "The social pressure to eat animal products when dining with non-plant-based peers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'What-The-Hell Effect' is a cognitive trap where a person feels that since they have already 'ruined' their diet with one small slip-up, they might as well overindulge for the rest of the day, leading to significant caloric excess and guilt."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "To optimize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a plant-based athlete, what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal suggested by current sports nutrition research?",
            "options": [
                "0.5g - 1.0g",
                "1.5g - 2.0g",

                "5.0g - 7.0g"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 2.5g to 3.0g of the amino acid Leucine is required to trigger the mTOR pathway and maximize muscle protein synthesis. Because plant proteins are often lower in leucine, larger servings or specific combinations are needed to hit this threshold."

            "question": "Regarding the safety of lectins in legumes (Lesson 5), which statement is scientifically accurate?",
            "options": [
                "Lectins are heat-stable and remain toxic even after pressure cooking.",
                "Soaking beans for 12 hours is sufficient to remove 100% of lectins without cooking.",
                "Boiling legumes at 100°C (212°F) for at least 10 minutes effectively inactivates phytohaemagglutinin.",
                "Lectins are only found in the skins of fruit and are not present in legumes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While raw legumes (especially kidney beans) contain high levels of the lectin phytohaemagglutinin, boiling them at 100°C for 10 minutes or more completely inactivates the lectins, making them safe for consumption and highly nutritious."
