            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "According to the mechanism of 'lipotoxicity' discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary cause of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive glucose consumption leading to glycogen overflow",
                "Accumulation of intramyocellular lipids (fat) which blocks the insulin signaling pathway",
                "A lack of dietary fiber causing rapid spikes in serum insulin",
                "The conversion of complex carbohydrates into adipose tissue via de novo lipogenesis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin resistance is primarily driven by the accumulation of fat inside muscle cells (intramyocellular lipids), which interferes with the glucose transport protein (GLUT4) signaling mechanism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the landmark BROAD study (2017) referenced in Lesson 2, what was the average weight loss achieved by the whole-food plant-based group at the 6-month mark without calorie restriction?",
            "options": [
                "4.2 kg (9.2 lbs)",
                "8.5 kg (18.7 lbs)",
                "12.1 kg (26.6 lbs)",
                "15.8 kg (34.8 lbs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The BROAD study showed a mean weight reduction of 12.1 kg at 6 months, which is one of the largest weight losses ever recorded in a randomized controlled trial without mandated exercise or calorie counting."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client with hypertension is following a DASH/Plant-Based hybrid approach. Which nutrient-to-sodium ratio is most critical for reducing peripheral vascular resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Calcium-to-Sodium ratio",
                "Magnesium-to-Sodium ratio",
                "Potassium-to-Sodium ratio",
                "Fiber-to-Sodium ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High potassium intake (found in beans, greens, and potatoes) helps the body excrete sodium and relaxes blood vessel walls, making the Potassium-to-Sodium ratio a key predictor of blood pressure health."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "The 'Portfolio Diet' discussed in Lesson 4 uses four specific pillars to lower LDL cholesterol. Which of the following is NOT one of those pillars?",
            "options": [
                "Soy protein (25g/day)",
                "Viscous (soluble) fiber (20g/day)",
                "Plant sterols (2g/day)",
                "Medium-chain triglycerides (15g/day)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Portfolio Diet pillars are soy protein, soluble fiber, plant sterols, and almonds. MCT oil is not a component and may actually increase LDL levels in some individuals."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "In the context of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), why is plant protein considered superior to animal protein for reducing hepatic fat?",
            "options": [
                "Plant proteins contain higher levels of choline which prevents fat export",
                "Animal proteins are higher in methionine and branched-chain amino acids, which can promote insulin resistance and liver fat accumulation",
                "Plant proteins are digested faster, preventing the liver from processing them into fat",
                "Plant proteins specifically activate the SIRT1 gene to burn liver fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that the specific amino acid profile of animal protein (high in BCAA and methionine) contributes more to metabolic dysfunction and liver fat than the profile found in plant proteins."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 discusses 'Metabolic Adaptation.' How does a high-fiber, plant-based diet help counteract the drop in Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) during weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the thermic effect of food (TEF) due to the energy required to process fiber",
                "By stimulating the thyroid to produce more T3",
                "By decreasing the production of ghrelin in the stomach",
                "By increasing the bioavailability of protein in the distal colon"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Whole plant foods have a higher thermic effect of food (TEF). The body burns more calories digesting fiber-rich whole foods compared to processed foods, helping to offset the RMR decline."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Why is the phosphorus found in whole plant foods (like beans and nuts) less concerning for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients than phosphorus in meat or soda?",
            "options": [
                "Plant phosphorus is chemically different and cannot be absorbed",
                "Plant phosphorus is bound to phytates, resulting in only 30-50% absorption compared to 70-100% in animal/processed sources",
                "Plant phosphorus is excreted via the lungs rather than the kidneys",
                "The high potassium in plants neutralizes the phosphorus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because human beings lack the phytase enzyme, we cannot fully break down phytates, meaning much of the phosphorus in plants passes through the digestive tract unabsorbed, reducing the load on the kidneys."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A coach is reviewing a client's lab results. The client has been on a WFPB diet for 3 months. Which change in the Lipid Panel is most commonly observed first?",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in HDL ('Good') cholesterol",
                "A rapid decrease in Triglycerides within 48 hours",
                "A significant drop in LDL cholesterol, often between 15% and 35%",
                "An increase in VLDL due to carbohydrate intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LDL cholesterol typically drops significantly and rapidly (often within weeks) when transitioning to a WFPB diet due to the elimination of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat combined with increased fiber."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "When managing Type 2 Diabetes, what is the primary clinical reason for choosing low-glycemic index (GI) starches over high-GI starches?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the 'dawn phenomenon'",
                "To minimize postprandial (after-meal) glucose excursions and reduce the workload on beta-cells",
                "To ensure that the client stays in a state of ketosis",
                "To increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-GI starches release glucose slowly into the bloodstream, preventing sharp spikes that require massive insulin responses, thereby protecting the remaining function of the pancreatic beta-cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client with stage 2 CKD wants to ensure they are getting enough protein. Based on Lesson 7, what is the recommended protocol regarding protein source for kidney longevity?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain 1.5g/kg of body weight using whey protein",
                "Shift to 100% plant-based protein to reduce glomerular hyperfiltration",
                "Focus on red meat but limit it to once per day",
                "Avoid all protein for 16 hours a day (intermittent fasting)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant proteins do not cause the same 'hyperfiltration' (increased pressure in the kidney filters) that animal proteins do, making a plant-based diet protective for those with compromised kidney function."
