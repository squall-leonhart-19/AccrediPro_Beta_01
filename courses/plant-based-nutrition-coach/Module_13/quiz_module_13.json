            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "To optimize non-heme iron absorption in a plant-based athlete, what is the recommended minimum amount of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) to consume alongside an iron-rich meal to counteract the inhibitory effects of phytates?",
            "options": [
                "10-15 mg",
                "25-50 mg",
                "500 mg",
                "1,000 mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 25-50 mg of Vitamin C can significantly increase non-heme iron absorption by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous state and preventing the formation of insoluble iron-phytate complexes."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of bone health, what is the physiological role of Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) that distinguishes it from Vitamin D3?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the intestinal absorption of calcium.",
                "It stimulates the production of parathyroid hormone.",
                "It activates osteocalcin, which binds calcium into the bone matrix.",
                "It reduces the excretion of calcium through the kidneys."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, Vitamin K2 is essential for the gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin, the protein responsible for incorporating calcium into the bone hydroxyapatite matrix."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to the MIND Diet framework for cognitive longevity, high adherence to the protocol was associated with what percentage reduction in the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease?",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "32%",
                "53%",
                "78%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study by Morris et al. (2015) found that participants with the highest adherence to the MIND diet had a 53% lower risk of Alzheimer's Disease compared to those with the lowest adherence."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "For clients managing PCOS and insulin resistance, why is a high-fiber, low-glycemic load plant-based diet specifically recommended for hormonal balance?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), lowering free testosterone levels.",
                "It completely eliminates the production of luteinizing hormone (LH).",
                "It converts excess estrogen into progesterone in the gut.",
                "It prevents the thyroid from absorbing iodine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-fiber diets help improve insulin sensitivity, which in turn stimulates the liver to produce more SHBG. Higher SHBG levels bind to excess circulating androgens (like testosterone), reducing the symptoms of PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) produced by the fermentation of prebiotic fibers is primarily responsible for inducing the differentiation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, thereby promoting immune tolerance?",

                "Propionate",
                "Butyrate",
                "Lactate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate acts as a signaling molecule that promotes the differentiation of colonic Treg cells, which are crucial for suppressing inflammatory responses and maintaining immune homeostasis."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "To maximize muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in plant-based athletes, what is the 'Leucine Threshold' typically required per meal to trigger the mTORC1 pathway?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",

                "10.0+ grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Leucine Threshold for most adults is approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams per meal. Since plant proteins are generally lower in leucine than whey, athletes may need to consume larger portions or specific blends (e.g., pea and rice) to hit this target."

                "Lipase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sprouting activates endogenous phytase enzymes, which break down phytic acid (phytate). This significantly increases the bioavailability of minerals like zinc, iron, and calcium."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In clinical weight management, the 'Energy Density' principle suggests that satiety is more closely related to the ________ of food consumed than the calorie content.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Satiety is heavily influenced by gastric distension (mechanoreceptors in the stomach wall). Consuming foods with low energy density (high volume/weight but low calories, like vegetables) allows for greater satiety with fewer total calories."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "To avoid the inhibition of zinc absorption, what is the recommended 'Phytate-to-Zinc Molar Ratio' for a healthy plant-based diet?",

                "Greater than 20",
                "Between 15 and 20",
                "Less than 15",
                "Zero (phytates must be eliminated)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and other bodies suggest that a phytate-to-zinc molar ratio of less than 15 is necessary to ensure adequate zinc absorption from plant-based diets."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Brain Fog' and a family history of cognitive decline. Based on the MIND diet, which specific fruit should you encourage them to consume at least twice per week?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MIND diet specifically singles out berries (especially blueberries and strawberries) due to their high anthocyanin content and demonstrated neuroprotective effects, whereas other fruits are not specifically emphasized in the framework."
