            "question": "To maximize the bioavailability of non-heme iron in a plant-based meal, what is the most effective evidence-based strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming 75-100mg of Vitamin C with the meal to counteract phytates",
                "Increasing total dietary fiber to 50g per day",
                "Drinking black tea immediately after the meal to aid digestion",
                "Consuming calcium-fortified plant milk simultaneously with iron-rich legumes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption, capable of increasing uptake by 3-4 times by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous form and preventing the formation of insoluble iron-phytate complexes."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Which plant-based food source provides the highest calcium bioavailability (fractional absorption rate of ~50-60%)?",
            "options": [
                "Spinach and Swiss Chard",
                "Almonds and Brazil nuts",
                "Low-oxalate cruciferous vegetables like Bok Choy and Kale",
                "Unsprouted sesame seeds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While spinach is high in calcium, its high oxalate content limits absorption to ~5%. Low-oxalate greens like Bok Choy, Kale, and Broccoli have a fractional absorption rate of 50-60%, which is higher than cow's milk (~32%)."

            "options": [
                "At least one serving per day",
                "At least two servings per week",
                "Only in the morning on an empty stomach",
                "Berries are not specifically emphasized over other fruits"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MIND diet specifically highlights berries (especially blueberries and strawberries) for their high anthocyanin content, recommending at least two servings per week to slow cognitive decline."

                "100:1 ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological plasma ratio and has been shown in clinical trials to be the most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the primary fuel for colonocytes and plays a critical role in immune resilience by promoting the differentiation of T-regulatory cells, which helps prevent systemic inflammation."

            "question": "To reach the 'Leucine Threshold' necessary to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a plant-based athlete, how much leucine is typically required per meal?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.5 - 2.0 grams",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The leucine threshold for maximal MPS is generally 2.5 to 3.0 grams per meal. Plant-based athletes often need to consume larger portions or specific protein blends (e.g., pea and rice) to meet this requirement compared to whey protein."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Sprouting legumes and grains for 48-72 hours typically results in what physiological change regarding mineral bioavailability?",
            "options": [
                "It increases phytic acid by 20%",
                "It reduces phytic acid by 40-60% and activates endogenous phytase",
                "It has no effect on mineral absorption",
                "It decreases the protein content by half"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sprouting triggers the activation of the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid (an anti-nutrient), significantly increasing the bioavailability of zinc, iron, and calcium."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In clinical weight management, why does a diet with low energy density (e.g., 0.7 kcal/g) improve satiety compared to a high energy density diet?",
            "options": [
                "It triggers gastric mechanoreceptors (stretch receptors) due to higher food volume",
                "It increases the production of Ghrelin",
                "It slows down the metabolic rate to preserve energy",
                "It relies solely on the thermic effect of fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Low energy density foods (high in water and fiber) allow for a larger volume of food. This physical bulk triggers gastric stretch receptors, which signal satiety to the brain via the vagus nerve, regardless of calorie count."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that to ensure adequate zinc absorption on a high-phytate plant-based diet, the Zinc-to-Phytate molar ratio should be:",
            "options": [
                "Above 20",
                "Exactly 30",
                "Below 15",
                "Between 50 and 60"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A molar ratio of phytate to zinc below 15 is generally considered necessary to ensure adequate zinc absorption. Ratios above 15 significantly impair zinc status."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A plant-based client is consuming adequate calcium and Vitamin D but still shows markers of poor bone mineralization. Which nutrient is essential for the carboxylation of osteocalcin to bind calcium to the bone matrix?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7)",
                "Iodine",
                "Selenium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K2 acts as a cofactor for the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, which carboxylates osteocalcin. Without K2, osteocalcin remains inactive and cannot effectively bind calcium into the hydroxyapatite crystals of the bone."
