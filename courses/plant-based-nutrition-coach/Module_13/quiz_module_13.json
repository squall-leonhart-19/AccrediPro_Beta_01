            "question": "A coach says to a client: 'It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed by the social pressure of holiday dinners while trying to maintain your plant-based lifestyle.' Which element of the OARS acronym in Motivational Interviewing is being used?",

                "Open-ended questioning",
                "Affirmation",
                "Reflective listening",
                "Summarizing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening involves capturing the essence of what the client has said and mirroring it back to show empathy and ensure understanding."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), a client who is aware that their current diet is causing health issues but is not yet ready to commit to a change within the next month is in which stage?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Contemplation stage, the individual is aware of the problem and considering change (usually within the next 6 months) but is still ambivalent and has not yet made a commitment to take action."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Research on emotional eating suggests that 'emotional hunger' can be distinguished from 'physical hunger' by which of the following characteristics?",

                "It develops gradually over several hours",
                "It is felt in the stomach (growling/emptiness)",
                "It occurs suddenly and creates a craving for specific 'comfort' foods",
                "It is easily satisfied by any type of food, such as an apple"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Emotional hunger is characterized by sudden onset, urgency, and a specific craving for 'highly palatable' foods (often high in fat/sugar), whereas physical hunger is gradual and more flexible regarding food choice."

                "'I want to lower my LDL cholesterol by 15%.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on the 'who' (the person you wish to become) rather than the 'outcome' (the result). This shifts the internal narrative from something the client 'has to do' to 'who they are.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on Motivational Interviewing (MI) in nutritional counseling found that MI-based interventions were significantly more effective than traditional advice-giving. What is the primary reason for this?",
            "options": [
                "The coach provides more scientific data to the client",
                "The coach creates a strict meal plan for the client to follow",
                "The coach elicits the client's own internal motivations (Change Talk)",
                "The coach uses fear-based tactics to encourage compliance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MI is effective because it reduces resistance and increases 'Change Talk'—the client's own arguments for change—which is a much stronger predictor of behavior change than external advice."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "When a client experiences a weight loss plateau or a lapse in their plant-based habits, the coach should 'Roll with Resistance.' Which of the following is an example of this technique?",

                "Correcting the client's misconceptions immediately",
                "Agreeing with the client's reasons for not changing to avoid conflict",
                "Acknowledging the client's perspective and reframing the challenge as a learning opportunity",
                "Increasing the intensity of the goals to 'break through' the plateau"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rolling with Resistance involves avoiding argumentation and instead using the client's resistance as a signal to change coaching direction or explore the client's ambivalence further."

                "The use of a single dietary standard for all group members",
                "The tendency of groups to follow a single dominant leader"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality is a powerful therapeutic factor in group coaching where clients feel a sense of relief and validation upon discovering that others share similar challenges and feelings."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "According to Albert Bandura, which is the most influential source of 'Self-Efficacy' (a client's belief in their ability to succeed)?",
            "options": [
                "Verbal persuasion (the coach telling them they can do it)",
                "Vicarious experiences (seeing others succeed)",
                "Mastery experiences (past successes with small, manageable tasks)",
                "Emotional arousal (feeling excited about the new diet)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery experiences—actually performing a task successfully—provide the most authentic evidence of whether one can muster whatever it takes to succeed."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "What is the recommended approach for a coach when a client is in the 'Action' stage but begins to show signs of 'discord' or frustration with the slow pace of results?",
            "options": [
                "Move them back to the Preparation stage to re-evaluate goals",
                "Focus on non-scale victories and reinforce self-efficacy through small wins",
                "Tell the client they need to try harder and be more disciplined",
                "Ignore the frustration and stick strictly to the nutritional protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the Action stage, it is vital to maintain momentum by shifting focus to 'process goals' and non-scale victories (energy levels, digestion, etc.) to sustain self-efficacy during periods of slow physical change."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a 'SMART' goal that follows the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound criteria for a client new to plant-based eating?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This option is Specific (almond yogurt), Measurable (5 days per week), Achievable (small change), Relevant (transitioning to plant-based), and Time-bound (next 14 days)."
