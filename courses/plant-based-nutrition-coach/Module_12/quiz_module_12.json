            "question": "In the 'Science of Flavor,' which combination demonstrates the most potent 'Umami Synergy' by pairing L-glutamate with 5'-ribonucleotides?",
            "options": [
                "Tomato sauce with dried shiitake mushrooms",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Umami synergy occurs when ingredients rich in glutamate (like tomatoes) are paired with those rich in nucleotides like guanylate (found in dried mushrooms), resulting in a flavor perception up to 8 times stronger than either ingredient alone."

            "question": "When utilizing oil-free cooking techniques, what is the primary purpose of 'deglazing' the pan with small amounts of vegetable broth or water?",
            "options": [
                "To lower the caloric density of the final dish",
                "To prevent the loss of water-soluble vitamins",
                "To incorporate the fond (browned bits) created by the Maillard reaction back into the food",
                "To increase the boiling point of the vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Deglazing releases the 'fond'—the caramelized sugars and proteins stuck to the pan during the Maillard reaction—which is essential for depth of flavor in the absence of fats/oils."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients with high decision fatigue, Full Meal Assembly is superior because it removes the need for any creative or logistical choices at the point of consumption; they simply 'heat and eat.'"
