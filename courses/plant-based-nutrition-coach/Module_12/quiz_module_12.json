            "question": "In the context of longevity and cellular autophagy, which signaling pathway is primarily suppressed to trigger the 'self-eating' process during periods of nutrient scarcity?",
            "options": [
                "AMPK (Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase)",
                "mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin)",
                "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)",
                "IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autophagy is inhibited by nutrient-sensing pathways, specifically mTOR. When mTOR is suppressed (via caloric restriction or fasting), the cell initiates autophagy to recycle damaged proteins and organelles. AMPK and SIRT1 actually promote autophagy when activated."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client with subclinical hypothyroidism is concerned about consuming soy. According to current clinical evidence, what is the most accurate advice regarding soy and thyroid function?",
            "options": [
                "Soy must be completely avoided as it permanently damages the thyroid peroxidase enzyme.",
                "Soy is only a concern if iodine intake is insufficient, as isoflavones may compete for iodine uptake.",
                "Soy acts as a thyroid stimulant and can help resolve hypothyroidism.",
                "Fermented soy is harmful, but processed soy isolates are safe for thyroid health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that soy isoflavones do not adversely affect thyroid function in euthyroid individuals with adequate iodine intake. In those with compromised thyroid function or iodine deficiency, soy may exacerbate the condition by interfering with iodine absorption."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During the second and third trimesters of a plant-based pregnancy, the requirement for which nutrient increases significantly to 450-550mg daily to support fetal brain development and placental signaling?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Iron",
                "Choline",
                "Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While iron and B12 are critical, Choline requirements increase to 450mg/day for pregnant women and 550mg/day for lactating women. Plant-based sources include cruciferous vegetables, beans, and soy, but supplementation is often necessary to reach these specific levels."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When transitioning an infant to solid foods (weaning) on a plant-based diet, what is the primary concern regarding 'bulk' and energy density?",
            "options": [
                "Infants cannot digest plant proteins until age two.",
                "High-fiber diets may lead to premature satiety before caloric needs are met.",
                "Plant-based fats are too high in saturated fatty acids for infants.",
                "Antinutrients in grains prevent any absorption of calcium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The high fiber content of whole plant foods can cause 'early satiety,' where an infant feels full before they have consumed enough calories for growth. Practitioners should recommend energy-dense foods like avocado, nut butters, and hulled grains."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "To overcome the 'anabolic resistance' associated with sarcopenia in aging adults (Gerontology), what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.5 - 2.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "5.0 - 6.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As we age, the muscles become less responsive to protein. To trigger MPS in older adults, a higher dose of the amino acid leucine (approx. 2.5-3g per meal) is required, which may necessitate combining specific plant proteins like soy, pea, and corn."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "An elite plant-based athlete is looking to improve explosive power and recovery. Which ergogenic aid, often lower in vegan populations, has been shown to improve repeated high-intensity sprint performance by 5-15%?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-Alanine",
                "Creatine Monohydrate",
                "L-Carnitine",
                "Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vegans often have lower baseline muscle creatine stores. Supplementing with Creatine Monohydrate has been shown to significantly improve power output and high-intensity performance, often showing a more pronounced effect in vegetarians/vegans than meat-eaters."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "In Nutrigenomics, individuals with certain polymorphisms in the FADS1 and FADS2 genes may experience which of the following challenges on a plant-based diet?",
            "options": [
                "Inability to absorb Vitamin B12 from supplements.",
                "Poor conversion of Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) to EPA and DHA.",
                "Increased sensitivity to caffeine-induced anxiety.",
                "Rapid degradation of Vitamin D in the skin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FADS (Fatty Acid Desaturase) genes regulate the conversion of short-chain omega-3s (ALA) to long-chain forms (EPA/DHA). Certain genotypes are 'poor converters,' meaning these individuals may need direct algae-based EPA/DHA supplementation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-efficacy, a term coined by Albert Bandura, is the bridge between knowing what to do and actually doing it. High self-efficacy is one of the strongest predictors of long-term dietary adherence."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Research on the 'Blue Zones' suggests that the common dietary denominator for longevity is the consumption of approximately 1 cup of which food group daily?",
            "options": [
                "Leafy Greens",
                "Legumes (Beans/Lentils)",

                "Cruciferous Vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legumes are the cornerstone of every longevity diet in the world, providing a unique combination of fiber, resistant starch, and plant protein that supports a healthy microbiome and stable blood glucose."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Regarding Adrenal Health, why might a 'Low-Carbohydrate Plant-Based' diet be counterproductive for a client experiencing high stress and elevated evening cortisol?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrates are required to transport tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier for serotonin/melatonin production.",
                "Low-carb diets increase the production of thyroid hormone, which stresses the adrenals.",
                "Fats are the only macronutrient that can suppress cortisol.",
                "Fiber in plant-based diets prevents the absorption of adrenal-supporting minerals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Insulin (stimulated by carbohydrates) helps lower cortisol and facilitates the uptake of competing amino acids into muscles, allowing tryptophan to enter the brain. This is essential for producing serotonin and melatonin to manage stress and sleep."
