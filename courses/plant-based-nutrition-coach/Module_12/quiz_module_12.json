        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the context of longevity, which metabolic pathway is primarily inhibited during periods of fasting or low-protein intake to stimulate cellular autophagy?",
            "options": ["AMPK (Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase)", "mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin)", "IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)", "SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "mTOR is a nutrient sensor that promotes cell growth and protein synthesis; its inhibition (via low protein or caloric restriction) is the primary trigger for autophagy, the body's cellular cleanup process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A plant-based client presents with fatigue and cold intolerance. While their TSH is normal, you suspect 'subclinical' issues. Which nutrient, found in high concentrations in Brazil nuts, is critical for the conversion of T4 to the active T3 thyroid hormone?",
            "options": ["Iodine", "Zinc", "Selenium", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a required cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that convert thyroxine (T4) into the biologically active triiodothyronine (T3)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on preconception and pregnancy, what is the recommended daily intake of Choline for pregnant individuals to support fetal neurodevelopment and prevent neural tube defects?",
            "options": ["200 mg", "450 mg", "550 mg", "900 mg"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Adequate Intake (AI) for choline during pregnancy is 450 mg/day, which is vital for brain development and gene expression (via methylation)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When transitioning an infant to solid foods (6+ months) on a plant-based diet, which nutrient is of highest priority due to the rapid depletion of neonatal stores?",
            "options": ["Calcium", "Vitamin D", "Iron", "Vitamin K"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iron stores accumulated in utero begin to deplete around 6 months of age. Because plant-based iron (non-heme) has lower bioavailability, high-iron plant foods paired with Vitamin C are essential."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "To combat sarcopenia in geriatric plant-based patients, research suggests a 'leucine threshold' must be met at each meal to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS). What is this approximate threshold per meal?",
            "options": ["0.5 - 1.0 grams", "1.5 - 2.0 grams", "2.5 - 3.0 grams", "5.0 - 6.0 grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Trigger' hypothesis suggests that roughly 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine per meal is required to optimally stimulate mTOR and muscle protein synthesis in older adults."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In advanced sports performance, what is the primary advantage of a high-carbohydrate plant-based diet regarding the Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER)?",
            "options": ["It lowers RER, indicating higher fat oxidation", "It increases glycogen storage efficiency and glycolytic capacity", "It reduces the need for electrolyte supplementation", "It prevents the production of lactic acid entirely"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High carbohydrate availability from plant-based sources optimizes glycogen stores, allowing athletes to maintain higher intensities (relying on glycolysis) for longer durations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A client has a genetic polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (677C->T). Why should a plant-based coach prioritize natural food folate over synthetic folic acid for this individual?",
            "options": ["Synthetic folic acid is toxic to the liver", "The polymorphism reduces the ability to convert synthetic folic acid into its active 5-MTHF form", "Natural folate contains more fiber", "Folic acid inhibits the absorption of Vitamin B12"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with MTHFR polymorphisms have reduced enzymatic activity to methylate folate; synthetic folic acid can lead to a buildup of unmetabolized folic acid in the blood, whereas natural folates or methylated supplements bypass this bottleneck."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "According to the Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change), a client who is 'ambivalent'—recognizing the benefits of a plant-based diet but focusing heavily on the 'cons'—is in which stage?",
            "options": ["Pre-contemplation", "Contemplation", "Preparation", "Action"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Contemplation stage is characterized by ambivalence; the individual is aware a problem exists but is not yet committed to taking action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Recent meta-analyses on cognitive decline (Gerontology) suggest that the 'MIND' diet, which emphasizes leafy greens and berries, reduces Alzheimer's risk by approximately what percentage in high-adherence groups?",
            "options": ["15%", "33%", "53%", "75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies on the MIND diet (a hybrid of Mediterranean and DASH with a plant-forward focus) have shown a reduction in Alzheimer's risk of up to 53% for those who adhere strictly to its guidelines."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "Which strategy is most effective for a plant-based athlete looking to maximize hypertrophy while managing the lower DIAAS (Digestive Indispensable Amino Acid Score) of plant proteins?",
            "options": ["Consuming only one type of protein source per day", "Increasing total daily protein intake to 1.6 - 2.2g/kg and utilizing protein complementing", "Reducing carbohydrate intake to force gluconeogenesis", "Avoiding all soy-based products due to phytoestrogens"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To compensate for lower individual amino acid scores and lower digestibility of some plant proteins, athletes should increase total volume (1.6-2.2g/kg) and vary protein sources to ensure a complete amino acid profile."
