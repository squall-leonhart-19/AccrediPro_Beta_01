            "question": "To optimize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in plant-based athletes, what is the recommended 'leucine threshold' per meal to ensure the mTOR pathway is sufficiently activated?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 - 1.5 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "4.5 - 5.0 grams",
                "0.5 - 0.8 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of the amino acid leucine are required per meal to trigger the 'leucine trigger' mechanism for muscle protein synthesis, which may require higher total protein intake or specific amino acid blending in plant-based diets."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In the context of healthy aging, why is the 'protein distribution' strategy (e.g., 0.4g/kg per meal) considered superior to a single large protein-heavy meal for seniors?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the risk of kidney stones",
                "It prevents atrophic gastritis",
                "It overcomes 'anabolic resistance' by providing consistent signaling for muscle maintenance",
                "It increases the absorption of Vitamin B12"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging is associated with 'anabolic resistance,' where muscles become less responsive to protein. Distributing protein evenly across 3-4 meals ensures the mTOR pathway is activated multiple times daily, helping to prevent sarcopenia."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), by what factor should the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron be multiplied for plant-based pregnant clients?",
            "options": [
                "1.2x",
                "1.5x",
                "1.8x",
                "2.2x"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the lower bioavailability of non-heme iron compared to heme iron, the IOM recommends that vegetarians and vegans consume 1.8 times the standard RDA for iron, which is especially critical during pregnancy to support increased blood volume."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When coaching a family on pediatric plant-based nutrition, why is 'caloric density' a primary concern during the weaning phase (6-12 months)?",
            "options": [
                "Infants have a very limited gastric capacity and cannot meet high energy needs with high-fiber, low-calorie foods alone",
                "High fiber intake prevents the absorption of all protein",
                "Infants require at least 50% of their calories from simple sugars",
                "Plant-based fats are toxic to the developing infant brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Infants have small stomachs but high energy requirements for growth. A diet too high in bulky, high-fiber, low-calorie vegetables can lead to premature satiety before the infant has consumed enough calories and fats for healthy development."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "A client aiming for weight management is encouraged to focus on foods within the 'Green Zone' of caloric density. What is the caloric density range associated with successful ad libitum weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "100 - 300 calories per pound",
                "400 - 600 calories per pound",
                "800 - 1,000 calories per pound",
                "1,200 - 1,500 calories per pound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Foods in the 400-600 calories per pound range (primarily whole starches, legumes, and fruits) provide high satiety and allow clients to eat until full while maintaining a calorie deficit without restrictive portion counting."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A client reports an itchy mouth and throat after eating raw peaches and almonds, but has no reaction when they are cooked. Which condition should the coach suspect?",
            "options": [
                "Anaphylactic Peanut Allergy",
                "Celiac Disease",
                "Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS) / Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome",
                "Histamine Intolerance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oral Allergy Syndrome occurs when the immune system cross-reacts to proteins in certain raw fruits/nuts that are similar to pollen. The proteins are usually denatured by heat, which is why cooked versions are often tolerated."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "In clients with PCOS, how does a high-fiber, low-glycemic plant-based diet specifically help restore hormonal balance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing circulating estrogen levels",
                "By reducing insulin resistance, which subsequently lowers androgen production and increases SHBG",
                "By suppressing the thyroid gland's uptake of iodine",
                "By eliminating the need for any physical activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High fiber intake improves insulin sensitivity. Lower insulin levels signal the ovaries to produce fewer androgens and signal the liver to increase Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), which binds excess testosterone."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "From a sustainability perspective, Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) data shows that producing 100g of protein from beef typically requires how much more land than producing 100g of protein from peas?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 2 times more land",
                "Approximately 5 times more land",
                "Approximately 10 times more land",
                "Approximately 20-50 times more land"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Beef production is significantly more land-intensive due to the feed-to-meat conversion ratio. LCA data shows beef requires roughly 20 to 50 times more land per unit of protein compared to highly efficient pulses like peas or soy."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Which ergogenic aid has research shown to provide a greater relative benefit to plant-based athletes compared to omnivorous athletes due to lower baseline tissue saturation?",
            "options": [
                "Caffeine",
                "Sodium Bicarbonate",
                "Creatine Monohydrate",
                "Whey Protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because the primary dietary sources of creatine are meat and fish, plant-based athletes typically have lower baseline muscle creatine stores. Supplementation often results in a more significant increase in muscle phosphocreatine and performance compared to omnivores."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "During the preconception and pregnancy phase, which nutrient—often found in eggs—is critical for fetal hippocampal development and may require targeted supplementation in a strict vegan diet?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K1",
                "Choline",
                "Magnesium",
                "Beta-carotene"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline is vital for fetal brain development and gene expression. While available in cruciferous vegetables and legumes, the amounts are lower than in eggs, making it a 'nutrient of concern' for plant-based pregnancies."
