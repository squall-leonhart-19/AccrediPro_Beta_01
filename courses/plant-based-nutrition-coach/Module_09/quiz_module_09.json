            "question": "Research on the gut-brain axis indicates that a significant percentage of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut. What is the estimated percentage produced by enterochromaffin cells in the intestinal lining?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 40-50%",
                "Approximately 70-75%",
                "Greater than 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Over 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, where it acts as a signaling molecule to communicate with the central nervous system via the vagus nerve."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the American Gut Project (2018), which factor was the strongest predictor of a diverse and healthy gut microbiome?",

                "Consuming at least 30 different types of plants per week",
                "Taking a high-potency multi-strain probiotic daily",
                "Eliminating all gluten and dairy products",
                "Consuming at least 50 grams of total fiber per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found that individuals who consumed more than 30 different plant types per week had significantly more diverse microbiomes than those who ate fewer than 10."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced when gut bacteria ferment prebiotic fibers. Which SCFA is specifically recognized as the primary energy source for colonocytes (colon cells)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate provides approximately 70% of the energy requirements for colonocytes and is essential for maintaining the mucosal barrier and preventing inflammation."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A client transitioning to a plant-based diet reports significant bloating and gas. Which physiological mechanism best explains why this often occurs during the first 2-4 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "Fiber-induced intestinal permeability (Leaky Gut)",
                "A temporary lack of specific enzymes and microbial populations to handle increased fiber load",
                "An allergic reaction to lectins found in legumes",
                "The stomach producing too much hydrochloric acid to digest plant proteins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The microbiome requires time to shift its population to include more fiber-degrading bacteria; until this adaptation occurs, undigested fiber may ferment rapidly, causing gas."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Which of the following best defines 'Postbiotics' as discussed in the context of plant-based nutrition?",

                "Synthetic supplements taken after a course of antibiotics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postbiotics are the functional compounds (metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, or cell wall fragments) produced by bacteria during fermentation that exert health benefits on the host."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the context of 'Leaky Gut' (increased intestinal permeability), which protein is responsible for modulating the 'tight junctions' between epithelial cells?",
            "options": [
                "Zonulin",
                "Albumin",
                "Hemoglobin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels are associated with increased permeability and various autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "When managing a client with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) using a plant-based approach, what is the clinical recommendation regarding the Low FODMAP diet?",
            "options": [
                "It should be followed indefinitely to prevent symptom recurrence",
                "It is a short-term diagnostic tool (2-6 weeks) followed by systematic reintroduction",
                "It is ineffective for plant-based eaters due to the high fiber content of legumes",
                "It should only be used if the client is also diagnosed with Celiac disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Low FODMAP diet is an elimination and reintroduction protocol designed to identify triggers, not a long-term lifestyle, as chronic restriction can reduce microbial diversity."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "To maximize the probiotic benefits of fermented foods like sauerkraut or kimchi, which processing factor must be avoided?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heat pasteurization kills the live, active cultures that provide the probiotic benefits of fermented foods. Raw, unpasteurized versions are required for microbial benefits."

            "question": "How do polyphenols found in colorful plant foods (like berries and dark chocolate) influence the microbiome?",
            "options": [
                "They act as 'prebiotic-like' substances that selectively promote the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium",
                "They sterilize the gut by killing all bacteria, both good and bad",
                "They are converted into glucose, providing rapid energy for the host",
                "They have no effect on the microbiome as they are absorbed entirely in the stomach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90-95% of polyphenols reach the colon, where they are metabolized by microbes and act as prebiotics, enhancing the growth of beneficial species."

                "Drinking only fruit juices to avoid all fiber types"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For IBD clients, mechanical irritation can be reduced by modifying the texture (cooking, peeling, blending) of high-fiber foods while still providing the necessary nutrients for gut healing."
