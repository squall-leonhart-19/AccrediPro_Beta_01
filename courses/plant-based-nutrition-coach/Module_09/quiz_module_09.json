            "question": "For a high-performance plant-based endurance athlete, what is the recommended protein intake range to optimize muscle protein synthesis and compensate for lower digestibility of some plant proteins?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 2.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "2.5 - 3.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "Protein intake is irrelevant if caloric needs are met"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To account for the slightly lower bioavailability and different amino acid profiles of plant proteins, athletes are generally advised to aim for 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg of body weight, depending on training intensity and volume."

            "question": "In the context of healthy aging (Lesson 2), why is Vitamin B12 monitoring especially critical for plant-based seniors over the age of 60?",
            "options": [
                "Seniors have a higher rate of B12 excretion through the kidneys",
                "Plant-based sources of B12 become toxic in older age",
                "Reduced gastric acid and intrinsic factor production impair absorption of protein-bound B12",
                "B12 interferes with common medications for hypertension"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Atrophic gastritis and reduced stomach acid/intrinsic factor are common in seniors, making it difficult to cleave B12 from protein. Supplemental or fortified B12 (crystalline form) is recommended as it is more easily absorbed."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A plant-based client in her second trimester of pregnancy requires an increase in iron. What is the RDA for iron during pregnancy, and what strategy best enhances absorption?",
            "options": [
                "18mg; consuming iron with caffeine",
                "27mg; pairing non-heme iron with Vitamin C-rich foods",
                "45mg; taking calcium supplements simultaneously",
                "15mg; avoiding all legumes and grains"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The RDA for iron increases to 27mg during pregnancy. Since plant-based iron is non-heme, pairing it with Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) significantly increases absorption by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous state."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When coaching parents on pediatric plant-based nutrition for infants (6-12 months), what is the primary concern regarding 'bulky' whole foods?",
            "options": [
                "Children cannot digest fiber until age 5",
                "High fiber intake may lead to excessive weight gain",
                "The high volume and fiber can cause premature satiety before caloric needs are met",
                "Whole foods contain too many anti-nutrients for developing kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infants have small stomach capacities. A diet too high in fiber and low in energy density can cause them to feel full before they have consumed enough calories for rapid growth, making energy-dense foods like avocado and nut butters essential."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 (Weight Management), the concept of 'Calorie Density' suggests that most whole plant foods (fruits, vegetables, tubers) fall into which caloric range per pound?",
            "options": [
                "100 - 700 calories per pound",
                "800 - 1,200 calories per pound",
                "1,500 - 2,000 calories per pound",
                "Over 2,500 calories per pound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Whole plant foods like vegetables (100-200 cal/lb), fruits (300 cal/lb), and potatoes/legumes (400-600 cal/lb) are low in calorie density, allowing for high volume consumption while maintaining a caloric deficit."

            "question": "A client with a Birch pollen allergy experiences an itchy throat when eating raw soy or apples. What is this phenomenon called, and how can they often tolerate these foods?",
            "options": [
                "Anaphylaxis; they must avoid these foods for life",
                "Celiac Disease; they must remove gluten",
                "Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS); they can often tolerate the foods if they are cooked",
                "Lactose Intolerance; they should switch to almond milk"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oral Allergy Syndrome is a cross-reactivity between pollen and similar proteins in raw fruits/vegetables. Heat usually denatures the proteins, allowing many sufferers to eat the cooked versions without reaction."

            "question": "For a client with PCOS (Lesson 7), how does a high-fiber, low-glycemic plant-based diet help manage symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "It increases insulin resistance to protect the ovaries",
                "It lowers Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) levels",
                "It improves insulin sensitivity and helps increase SHBG, reducing bioavailable androgens",
                "It eliminates the need for any medical intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-fiber, low-GI diets improve insulin sensitivity. Lower insulin levels lead to an increase in SHBG, which binds to excess testosterone, thereby reducing the symptoms of hyperandrogenism common in PCOS."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, which environmental metric shows the most dramatic reduction when comparing a plant-based diet to a standard meat-centric diet?",
            "options": [
                "Plastic packaging waste",
                "Greenhouse gas emissions and land use",

                "Local noise pollution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data consistently shows that plant-based diets require significantly less land and produce a fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, methane) compared to animal-based diets."

            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old male athlete wants to improve his 'time to exhaustion' using nutritional nitrates. Which food should you recommend he consume 2-3 hours before training?",
            "options": [
                "White bread with honey",
                "Beetroot juice or arugula",
                "Steamed white rice",
                "Roasted almonds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beetroot and leafy greens like arugula are high in inorganic nitrates, which the body converts to nitric oxide. This improves mitochondrial efficiency and blood flow, enhancing exercise performance."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "Case Study: An 80-year-old plant-based woman is concerned about bone fractures. Beyond Calcium and Vitamin D, which nutrient found in green leafy vegetables is vital for bone mineralization (osteocalcin activation)?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin K2 (and K1)",
                "Vitamin B6",
                "Sodium",
                "Phosphorus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin K (specifically K1 from greens and K2 from fermented foods) is a cofactor for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, a protein essential for binding calcium to the bone matrix."
