            "question": "According to the concept of 'Phytochemical Synergy,' why is whole-food consumption superior to isolated nutrient supplementation for chronic disease prevention?",
            "options": [
                "Isolated supplements lack the necessary fiber to transport vitamins to the lower intestine.",
                "The food matrix allows for thousands of compounds to work bi-directionally, enhancing bioavailability and bioactivity through additive effects.",
                "Whole foods contain higher concentrations of single vitamins than pharmaceutical-grade supplements.",
                "Supplements are always synthetic, whereas food-based nutrients are always organic."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phytochemical synergy refers to the complex interactions within the food matrix where multiple compounds (like vitamin C and flavonoids) enhance each other's absorption and cellular impact, often exceeding the sum of their individual parts."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In the context of cardiovascular restoration, what is the primary mechanism by which a whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diet improves endothelial function?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the thickness of the arterial wall to prevent rupture.",
                "Reducing dietary cholesterol to zero, which immediately dissolves existing plaques.",
                "Upregulating nitric oxide production and reducing oxidative stress, allowing the endothelium to dilate properly.",
                "Increasing blood viscosity to ensure faster transport of oxygen to the myocardium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "WFPB diets, particularly those rich in leafy greens, provide dietary nitrates and antioxidants that restore the endothelial lining's ability to produce nitric oxide, essential for vasodilation and preventing atherosclerosis."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Research on glycemic control indicates that 'Intramyocellular Lipids' (IMCL) play a critical role in type 2 diabetes. How does a low-fat, plant-based diet address this?",
            "options": [
                "It increases IMCL to provide a steady fuel source for the mitochondria.",
                "It reduces the accumulation of fat inside muscle cells, which restores the insulin signaling pathway and glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation.",
                "It bypasses the muscle cells entirely by directing glucose to be stored as adipose tissue.",
                "It converts IMCL into ketones to prevent glucose spikes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intramyocellular lipids (fat inside muscle cells) interfere with insulin signaling. A low-fat WFPB diet reduces these lipid stores, allowing insulin to effectively signal the cell to take up glucose from the bloodstream."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which dietary factor found abundantly in plant foods is most strongly associated with a reduced risk of hip fractures and improved bone mineral density (BMD)?",

                "Phytoestrogens and the alkalizing effect of potassium-rich fruits and vegetables.",
                "Excessive intake of retinol (Vitamin A) from fortified cereals.",
                "Low-fiber intake to ensure maximum calcium absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Potassium-rich plant foods have an alkalizing effect that reduces calcium excretion in the urine, while phytoestrogens (like those in soy) can mimic protective effects on bone metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "For an endurance athlete, what is the primary ergogenic benefit of consuming nitrate-rich foods like beetroot or arugula 2-3 hours before exercise?",
            "options": [
                "A significant increase in maximum heart rate.",
                "Enhanced muscle hypertrophy through protein synthesis signaling.",
                "Reduced oxygen cost of exercise, allowing the athlete to perform at the same intensity with less effort.",
                "Immediate neutralization of all lactic acid produced during the event."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which improves mitochondrial efficiency and reduces the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise, effectively boosting endurance and VO2 max efficiency."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "How does a high-fiber, plant-based diet influence hormonal balance, specifically regarding circulating estrogen levels?",
            "options": [
                "It increases estrogen levels by stimulating the ovaries.",
                "Fiber binds to excess estrogen in the digestive tract, facilitating its excretion and preventing enterohepatic recirculation.",
                "It eliminates estrogen entirely, which is beneficial for all populations.",
                "Fiber converts testosterone into estrogen to maintain a 1:1 ratio."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fiber aids in the excretion of excess hormones. Without adequate fiber, estrogen that has been processed by the liver can be reabsorbed in the gut (enterohepatic recirculation), leading to higher circulating levels."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anthocyanins have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, where they reduce neuro-inflammation and stimulate BDNF, a protein essential for neuronal survival and neurogenesis."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In 'Environmental Nutrition,' what is the estimated difference in water usage between the production of 1kg of beef versus 1kg of legumes?",
            "options": [
                "Beef requires approximately 2 times more water.",
                "Legumes require more water because of irrigation needs.",
                "Beef requires approximately 15-20 times more water than legumes.",
                "There is no statistically significant difference in water usage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Animal agriculture is highly resource-intensive; producing beef requires significantly more water (approx. 15,000 liters/kg) compared to legumes (approx. 500-900 liters/kg)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While plaque reversal takes years, metabolic markers like insulin sensitivity and blood pressure often show dramatic improvements within the first 7-14 days of a strict WFPB intervention."
