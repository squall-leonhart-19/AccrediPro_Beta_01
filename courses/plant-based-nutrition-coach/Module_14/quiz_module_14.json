            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "In the context of 'Phytochemical Synergy,' why is the whole-food matrix considered superior to isolated nutrient supplementation?",
            "options": [
                "Isolated supplements lack the caloric density required for nutrient transport.",
                "Phytochemicals in whole foods act pleiotropically, where multiple compounds enhance the bioavailability and bioactivity of one another.",
                "Whole foods contain synthetic binders that prevent the rapid oxidation of vitamins.",
                "The human digestive tract cannot recognize molecular structures in isolated forms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phytochemical synergy, often called the 'entourage effect,' refers to the complex interaction where the combination of compounds in whole plants (like sulforaphane and myrosinase in broccoli) produces a greater physiological effect than the sum of their individual parts."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which mechanism is primarily responsible for the reversal of atherosclerotic plaque observed in plant-based clinical protocols like those of Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn?",
            "options": [
                "The complete elimination of dietary carbohydrates to induce ketosis.",
                "The mechanical scrubbing of arterial walls by high-viscosity insoluble fiber.",
                "Restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx and increased nitric oxide bioavailability.",
                "High intake of saturated plant fats like coconut oil to 'lubricate' the vessel walls."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A whole-food plant-based diet restores the health of the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels), allowing for proper nitric oxide production which promotes vasodilation and prevents the adhesion of inflammatory cells to the vessel wall."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to the deep dive on glycemic control, what is the primary cause of insulin resistance in the muscle cells (intramyocellular level)?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive consumption of complex carbohydrates like brown rice and oats.",
                "The accumulation of intramyocellular lipids (fat) which interferes with the GLUT4 signaling pathway.",
                "A deficiency in dietary glucose leading to cellular starvation.",
                "The presence of dietary fiber which blocks the absorption of insulin in the gut."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) are tiny droplets of fat that build up inside muscle cells. These fats interfere with the insulin signaling process, preventing the glucose transporter (GLUT4) from moving to the cell surface, effectively 'gumming up the locks' of the cell."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client is concerned about bone mineral density (BMD) on a vegan diet. Based on Module 14, which dietary factor is more critical for bone health than simply meeting the RDA for calcium?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming high amounts of supplemental Vitamin C to acidify the blood.",
                "The ratio of Vitamin K2 (MK-7) and Vitamin D3 to ensure calcium is directed to the bone matrix rather than soft tissues.",
                "Eliminating all protein to prevent 'acid ash' from leaching calcium from the bones.",
                "Drinking distilled water to remove naturally occurring minerals that interfere with bone growth."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While calcium is important, Vitamin K2 (found in fermented plant foods like natto) and Vitamin D3 are essential 'traffic cops' that ensure calcium is deposited in the bones and teeth rather than the arteries."

                "2-3 hours before exercise to allow for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite and finally nitric oxide.",
                "Immediately following the event to prevent muscle soreness.",
                "Only during the 'loading phase' 48 hours prior to competition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peak plasma nitrite levels occur approximately 2 to 3 hours after ingestion of dietary nitrates. This timing reduces the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise and improves time-to-exhaustion."

                "Fiber increases the production of estrogen in the adrenal glands.",
                "Fiber acts as a direct hormone replacement therapy for progesterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The liver filters excess estrogen and sends it to the gut for excretion. Without adequate fiber, this estrogen is reabsorbed into the bloodstream (enterohepatic recirculation). High fiber intake ensures the excess estrogen is removed from the body."

                "Simple starches (found in white flour)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants that can cross the blood-brain barrier. Studies show they improve neuronal signaling and increase BDNF, which acts like 'Miracle-Gro' for the brain, supporting memory and learning."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In sustainable coaching, what is the 'Water-Footprint' disparity between 1kg of beef and 1kg of pulses (legumes)?",
            "options": [
                "Beef requires 2x more water than pulses.",
                "Beef requires roughly 15,000 liters/kg, whereas pulses require approximately 4,000 liters/kg.",
                "Pulses actually require more water due to irrigation needs in dry climates.",
                "There is no statistically significant difference in water usage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Animal agriculture is significantly more water-intensive. Producing 1kg of beef requires roughly 15,415 liters of water, compared to about 4,055 liters for pulses, making legumes a vastly more sustainable protein source."

                "The placebo effect, as diet has no impact on recovery speed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant-based diets are high in antioxidants and lower in saturated fats, which reduces blood viscosity (making blood less 'sludge-like'). This allows for more efficient delivery of oxygen to muscles and faster removal of metabolic byproducts like lactate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Environmental Nutrition' coaching strategy known as 'Trophic Level Optimization'?",
