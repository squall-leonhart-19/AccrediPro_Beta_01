            "question": "A plant-based pregnant client is concerned about meeting her Choline requirements. According to current guidelines, what is the daily Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for Choline during pregnancy, and why is it critical?",
            "options": [
                "450 mg/day; essential for fetal brain development and neural tube closure.",
                "250 mg/day; necessary for bone mineralization in the third trimester.",
                "550 mg/day; required for maternal liver function only.",
                "300 mg/day; primarily used for the synthesis of red blood cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The RDA for Choline increases to 450 mg/day during pregnancy to support fetal neurodevelopment and prevent neural tube defects, complementing folate's role."

            "question": "Regarding Vitamin B12 during lactation, which of the following statements is scientifically accurate for a vegan mother?",
            "options": [
                "The mother's body will prioritize the infant's B12 needs by leaching stores from her liver into the milk.",
                "B12 levels in breast milk are more dependent on the mother's current intake than her long-term stores.",
                "Supplementation is only necessary if the mother shows clinical signs of megaloblastic anemia.",
                "Infants can synthesize their own B12 from gut microflora by 4 months of age."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Vitamin B12 in breast milk is highly correlated with the mother's recent dietary intake and supplementation rather than her total body stores."

            "question": "A 3-year-old child on a whole-food plant-based diet is struggling to meet energy requirements due to early satiety from high fiber intake. What is the most effective clinical intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Restrict fiber intake to less than 5 grams per day.",
                "Increase the volume of green leafy vegetables at every meal.",
                "Incorporate energy-dense fats such as nut butters, seeds, and avocado into meals.",
                "Replace all solid foods with plant-based protein shakes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To overcome early satiety in children, practitioners should focus on increasing caloric density through healthy fats, as their small stomach capacity cannot always handle the volume of fiber required for energy needs."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "About 90% of peak bone mass is acquired by age 18-20, making adolescent nutrition critical for the long-term prevention of osteoporosis."

            "question": "In the context of menopause, how do soy isoflavones like genistein and daidzein exert a 'modulating' effect on hormonal health?",
            "options": [
                "They act as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs), binding to ER-beta receptors to potentially reduce hot flashes.",
                "They permanently block all estrogen receptors, inducing early menopause.",
                "They stimulate the ovaries to produce more endogenous estradiol.",
                "They are chemically identical to human estrogen and cause systemic hormonal spikes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phytoestrogens act as SERMs, having a higher affinity for ER-beta receptors, which can help alleviate vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) without the risks associated with synthetic hormone replacement."

                "Seniors should avoid high protein to protect kidney function regardless of health status."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, older adults require a higher per-meal protein bolus (30-40g) and sufficient Leucine to trigger the mTOR pathway for muscle synthesis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MIND diet is unique in its specific recommendation for berries (2+ servings/week) due to their high flavonoid/anthocyanin content, which has been linked to slower cognitive decline."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Why is the 'crystalline' form of Vitamin B12 (found in supplements and fortified foods) specifically recommended for adults over the age of 50?",
            "options": [
                "It is absorbed more slowly to prevent toxicity.",
                "It does not require gastric acid (HCL) to be released from animal protein, bypassing issues with atrophic gastritis.",
                "It is the only form that can cross the blood-brain barrier.",
                "It contains added calcium which seniors need for bone health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Up to 30% of adults over 50 have atrophic gastritis, which reduces stomach acid. Crystalline B12 is already 'free' and does not require acid-pepsin digestion to be released from protein bonds."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C can increase non-heme iron absorption by up to 3-6 times by reducing ferric iron to the more absorbable ferrous state and counteracting phytates."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "According to the principles of 'Healthy Aging,' what is the role of Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) in bone and cardiovascular health?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a primary energy source for osteoblasts.",
                "It activates osteocalcin to bind calcium to the bone matrix and MGP to prevent arterial calcification.",

                "It prevents the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the gut."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
