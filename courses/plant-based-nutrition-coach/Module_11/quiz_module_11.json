            "question": "In the Lifestyle Heart Trial conducted by Dr. Dean Ornish, what was the significant finding regarding coronary artery stenosis in the experimental group after one year?",
            "options": [
                "A 10% increase in diameter of the coronary arteries",
                "A significant regression of stenosis from 40.0% to 37.8%",
                "Stabilization of plaque with no change in diameter",
                "A reduction in LDL cholesterol but no change in physical arterial blockage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ornish Lifestyle Heart Trial was the first randomized controlled trial to show that intensive lifestyle changes (low-fat plant-based diet, stress management, exercise) could cause regression of even severe coronary atherosclerosis without lipid-lowering drugs."

            "question": "According to the 'Lipotoxicity' model of Type 2 Diabetes, how does a low-fat plant-based diet improve insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the amount of glucose transporters in the bloodstream",
                "By reducing intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) that block the insulin signaling pathway",
                "By stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin per gram of carbohydrate",
                "By slowing down the digestion of simple sugars through fiber fermentation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intracellular fat (intramyocellular lipids) interferes with the insulin signaling process, preventing glucose from entering the cell. Reducing dietary fat intake helps clear these lipids, restoring insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "The Plant-Dominant (PLADO) approach for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) recommends which specific protein distribution to minimize uremic toxins?",
            "options": [
                "At least 50% of protein from plant sources with a total intake of 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day",
                "100% plant protein with a total intake of 1.2 g/kg/day",
                "30% plant protein and 70% lean animal protein to ensure amino acid profile",
                "Unlimited plant protein as long as phosphorus additives are avoided"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The PLADO diet emphasizes a protein intake of 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day with at least 50% coming from plant sources to reduce the acid load, phosphorus bioavailability, and nitrogenous waste."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Why is the bioavailability of phosphorus a critical consideration when comparing plant-based proteins to processed animal proteins in renal health?",
            "options": [
                "Plant phosphorus is 100% bioavailable and absorbed instantly",
                "Animal phosphorus is bound to phytates, making it harder to absorb",
                "Phosphate additives in processed foods are absorbed at ~90-100%, while plant phytate phosphorus is absorbed at <50%",
                "There is no difference in absorption; only total milligrams of phosphorus matter"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Humans lack the enzyme phytase to fully break down phytate-bound phosphorus in plants, leading to lower absorption. In contrast, inorganic phosphorus additives in processed meats and sodas are almost entirely absorbed, putting more strain on the kidneys."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "To prevent sarcopenia and maintain nitrogen balance in the aging population (65+), what is the current evidence-based protein recommendation for those on a plant-based diet?",
            "options": [
                "0.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "0.8 g/kg of body weight (Standard RDA)",
                "1.2 to 1.5 g/kg of body weight",
                "2.0 to 2.5 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to 'anabolic resistance' in older adults and the slightly lower digestibility of some plant proteins, experts recommend 1.2–1.5 g/kg to maintain muscle mass and functional strength."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Calcium Paradox' observed in global nutritional epidemiology?",
            "options": [
                "Countries with the highest calcium intake often have the highest hip fracture rates",
                "Calcium supplements are absorbed better than calcium from kale",
                "The body excretes more calcium when it is consumed in liquid form",
                "High calcium intake causes a deficiency in Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Calcium Paradox refers to the observation that hip fracture rates are highest in countries (like the US and Northern Europe) with the highest dairy and calcium consumption, suggesting that factors like metabolic acid load and Vitamin D status are equally important."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "For pediatric plant-based nutrition, what is the primary strategy to ensure an infant meets their caloric requirements despite the high fiber content of plants?",
            "options": [
                "Avoiding all fiber until age 5",
                "Prioritizing nutrient-dense fats (avocado, nut butters) and refined grains if necessary to reduce bulk",
                "Increasing the volume of leafy greens to 5 servings per day",
                "Restricting water intake to ensure more room for solid food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because children have small stomachs, a diet too high in fiber can lead to early satiety before they meet their energy needs. Incorporating calorie-dense healthy fats and some lower-fiber options ensures adequate growth."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "During pregnancy, why is the conversion of Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) to Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) often insufficient for fetal brain development?",
            "options": [
                "ALA is toxic to the fetus",
                "The conversion rate is typically less than 1-5% in humans",
                "Pregnancy hormones completely block the delta-6 desaturase enzyme",
                "ALA can only be converted to EPA, never DHA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conversion of plant-based Omega-3 (ALA) to the long-chain DHA is very inefficient. During pregnancy and lactation, a direct source of DHA (such as algae oil) is recommended to support the baby's neurological and visual development."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "High-fiber diets in women are associated with lower circulating estrogen levels. What is the mechanism for this effect?",
            "options": [
                "Fiber destroys estrogen molecules in the stomach",
                "Fiber increases Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) production in the liver",
                "Fiber binds to conjugated estrogens in the digestive tract, preventing their reabsorption via enterohepatic circulation",
                "Fiber triggers the ovaries to stop producing estrogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is excreted by the liver into the gut. If fiber is present, it binds the estrogen and carries it out of the body. Without fiber, the estrogen can be reabsorbed back into the bloodstream, contributing to conditions like endometriosis or PCOS."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "According to the EAT-Lancet Commission, a 'Great Food Transformation' toward plant-based diets could prevent approximately how many adult deaths per year?",
            "options": [
                "1 million",
                "5 million",
                "11 million",
                "50 million"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The EAT-Lancet report estimated that a global shift to a healthy, plant-forward diet could prevent roughly 11 million premature deaths annually while remaining within planetary boundaries for sustainability."
