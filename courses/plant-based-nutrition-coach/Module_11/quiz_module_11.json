            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In the landmark 'Lifestyle Heart Trial' by Dr. Dean Ornish, what was the observed outcome for the experimental group following a low-fat plant-based diet after five years?",
            "options": [
                "A stabilization of plaque with no further growth",
                "A 7.9% relative improvement in diameter stenosis (regression of atherosclerosis)",
                "A 25% reduction in LDL cholesterol but no change in arterial diameter",
                "A 15% increase in collateral circulation despite worsening stenosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 1998 five-year follow-up of the Lifestyle Heart Trial showed that the experimental group achieved a 7.9% relative improvement in diameter stenosis, demonstrating that atherosclerosis can be reversed through intensive lifestyle changes."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Which mechanism explains why a whole-food plant-based diet (WFPB) is highly effective at reversing Type 2 Diabetes and improving insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "The high fiber content eliminates all glucose absorption in the small intestine",
                "Plant proteins trigger a higher glucagon response than animal proteins",
                "Reduction of intramyocellular lipids (fat inside muscle cells) which restores insulin signaling",
                "Phytates act as a direct substitute for exogenous insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "WFPB diets reduce intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs). High levels of IMCLs interfere with the insulin signaling pathway (specifically the GLUT4 translocation), leading to insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "The Plant-Dominant (PLADO) approach for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) recommends which specific protein distribution to mitigate uremic toxins and metabolic acidosis?",
            "options": [
                "0.8g/kg of protein with at least 30% from animal sources",
                "1.2g/kg of protein with a focus on whey isolates",
                "0.6-0.8g/kg of protein with at least 50% from plant-based whole foods",
                "Protein restriction to 0.3g/kg regardless of the source"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PLADO diet recommends a protein intake of 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day, with at least 50% coming from plant sources to reduce the acid load and phosphorus bioavailability compared to animal-based diets."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "When addressing bone health in a vegan athlete, which nutrient is critical for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, a protein necessary for bone mineralization?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Vitamin K2",
                "Phosphorus",
                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Calcium and Vitamin D are vital, Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) is essential for activating osteocalcin, which binds calcium to the bone matrix."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "To prevent sarcopenia in the aging population (>65 years), what is the recommended protein intake for those on a plant-based diet to account for lower leucine kinetics and digestibility?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 g/kg body weight",
                "1.0 g/kg body weight",
                "1.2 to 1.5 g/kg body weight",
                "Over 2.5 g/kg body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to 'anabolic resistance' in older adults and the slightly lower digestibility/leucine content of some plant proteins, 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg is recommended to maintain muscle mass."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, why might a plant-based child require a Zinc intake that is 50% higher than the RDA?",
            "options": [
                "Plant-based children have faster metabolic rates",
                "High phytate intake in whole grains and legumes can inhibit zinc absorption",
                "Zinc is lost more rapidly through perspiration in plant-based individuals",
                "Plant proteins lack the amino acids required to transport zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phytates, found in many plant staples, bind to zinc and reduce its bioavailability. Therefore, the RDA for zinc may be 50% higher for those consuming high-phytate diets without using soaking/sprouting techniques."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "During pregnancy and lactation, which nutrient—often low in plant-based diets unless specifically targeted—is crucial for fetal hippocampal development and preventing neural tube defects?",
            "options": [
                "Choline",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Potassium",
                "Vitamin E"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Choline is vital for brain development and gene expression. While found in soy and cruciferous vegetables, plant-based practitioners must ensure adequate intake as requirements increase significantly during pregnancy (450mg/day)."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Based on the Poore & Nemecek (2018) meta-analysis, moving from current diets to a diet that excludes animal products would reduce global food-related greenhouse gas emissions by approximately:",
            "options": [
                "15%",
                "33%",
                "49%",
                "73%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The study found that a shift to a plant-based diet could reduce food's greenhouse gas emissions by up to 73%, making it the 'single biggest way' to reduce environmental impact."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "In Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's study of 198 patients with established cardiovascular disease, what was the recurrence rate of 'major cardiac events' in the 177 patients who remained adherent to the WFPB diet over nearly 4 years?",
            "options": [
                "0.6%",
                "12.5%",
                "25.0%",
                "62.0%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Of the 177 adherent patients, only one (0.6%) experienced a major cardiac event, compared to 62% of the non-adherent group, demonstrating the profound protective effect of the diet."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Phosphate Bioavailability' advantage of plant-based proteins for patients with Stage 3-4 Chronic Kidney Disease?",
            "options": [
                "Plant phosphorus is 100% absorbed, allowing for lower food volume",
                "Plant phosphorus is bound to phytates, which humans lack the enzyme (phytase) to fully digest, resulting in only 30-50% absorption",
                "Plant foods contain no phosphorus",
                "Plant phosphorus bypasses the kidneys and is excreted via the lungs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phosphorus in plants is largely in the form of phytate. Since humans lack phytase, the absorption rate is much lower (30-50%) compared to animal phosphorus (>70%) or inorganic additives (100%), making it safer for renal patients."
