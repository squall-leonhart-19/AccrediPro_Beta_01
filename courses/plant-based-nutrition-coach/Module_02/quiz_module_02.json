            "question": "Flavonoids exert their antioxidant effects not just by scavenging free radicals, but also through which biochemical mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Chelating transition metal ions like iron and copper to prevent the Fenton reaction",
                "Directly increasing the production of insulin in the pancreas",

                "Inhibiting the absorption of all fat-soluble vitamins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beyond direct radical scavenging, flavonoids are potent metal chelators, which prevents these metals from catalyzing the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction."

            "question": "In the context of macular health, why are Lutein and Zeaxanthin unique compared to other carotenoids like Beta-carotene?",
            "options": [
                "They are the only carotenoids that can be converted into Vitamin D",
                "They specifically cross the blood-retina barrier to form macular pigment",
                "They increase the thickness of the cornea rather than affecting the retina",
                "They are only found in animal products and cannot be sourced from plants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lutein and Zeaxanthin are selectively deposited in the macula lutea of the eye, where they filter harmful blue light and protect against oxidative damage."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "What is the 'active' compound produced when the enzyme myrosinase acts upon the glucosinolate 'glucoraphanin'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is the isothiocyanate produced when glucoraphanin is hydrolyzed by the enzyme myrosinase, typically triggered by chopping or chewing."

                "2 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that waiting 40 minutes after chopping allows the heat-sensitive myrosinase enzyme to fully convert glucoraphanin into stable sulforaphane before cooking begins."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Anthocyanins, found in berries, have been shown in meta-analyses to improve cognitive function primarily by:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Anthocyanins and their metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier, where they enhance signaling and increase cerebral blood flow, leading to improved executive function."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Why are soy isoflavones categorized as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) rather than 'estrogen mimics'?",
            "options": [
                "They only bind to estrogen receptors in men, not women",
                "They have a higher affinity for ER-beta receptors, which are often anti-proliferative",
                "They increase testosterone levels to offset estrogenic effects",
                "They are chemically identical to pharmaceutical estradiol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Isoflavones like genistein bind preferentially to ER-beta receptors, which are associated with anti-proliferative effects, rather than ER-alpha receptors which drive cell growth in breast and uterine tissue."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lycopene (in tomatoes) is fat-soluble. Consuming it with a lipid source like olive oil increases its bioavailability by up to 3-5 times compared to eating it without fat."

                "To ensure the client consumes at least 2,500 calories per day",
                "To trigger multiple signaling pathways simultaneously through 'hormetic' stress",
                "To replace the need for all macronutrients like protein and fat",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The method emphasizes that different phytonutrients target different pathways (Nrf2, SIRT1, NF-kB); a diverse intake ensures a comprehensive 'symphony' of cellular protection."
