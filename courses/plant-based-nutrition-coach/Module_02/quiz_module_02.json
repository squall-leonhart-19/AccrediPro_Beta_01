            "question": "The 'Protein Combining' myth suggests that plant proteins must be eaten together at the same meal. Why is this scientifically inaccurate?",
            "options": [
                "Plants actually contain all 20 amino acids in varying proportions",
                "The body maintains an 'amino acid pool' that stores and recycles aminos over 24 hours",
                "The liver can synthesize essential amino acids from glucose",
                "Both A and B are correct"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Modern nutritional science (and the ADA) confirms that plants contain all essential amino acids, and the body's internal amino acid pool ensures that 'completeness' is achieved over the course of a day, not a single meal."

            "question": "A client presents with elevated Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) levels. Which nutrient deficiency does this specific biomarker confirm?",
            "options": [
                "Iron (Anemia)",
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)",

                "Omega-3 (DHA)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MMA is a functional marker for B12 status. Unlike serum B12, which can be masked by high folate intake or inactive analogues, elevated MMA specifically indicates a cellular B12 deficiency."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Based on the lesson 'Iron Mastery,' adding 75mg of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) to a meal can increase the absorption of non-heme iron by approximately how much?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "50%",
                "Up to 300-400%",
                "It has no significant effect on non-heme iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C acts as a powerful enhancer by reducing ferric iron to ferrous iron and preventing the formation of insoluble iron-phytate complexes, increasing absorption up to 4-fold."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological limitation regarding Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA) in a plant-based diet?",
            "options": [
                "ALA is toxic in high doses",
                "ALA cannot be found in plant sources",
                "The conversion rate of ALA to long-chain DHA is typically very low (<1-5%)",
                "ALA interferes with Calcium absorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While ALA is an essential omega-3 found in flax and walnuts, the enzymatic conversion to DHA is inefficient in humans, often requiring direct supplementation via algae oil for optimal brain health."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of these plant-based foods has the highest calcium bioavailability, significantly outperforming spinach?",
            "options": [
                "Spinach (due to high oxalates)",
                "Bok Choy (approx. 50-60% absorption)",

                "Beet Greens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-oxalate cruciferous vegetables like bok choy and kale have a calcium absorption rate of 50-60%, whereas high-oxalate spinach has an absorption rate of only about 5%."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "To reduce the 'anti-nutrient' effect of phytates on Zinc absorption, which preparation technique is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Freezing the vegetables",
                "Adding more salt to the cooking water",
                "Soaking, sprouting, or leavening (fermentation)",
                "Eating the food raw"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soaking and sprouting activate the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid, thereby releasing bound zinc and increasing its bioavailability."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which form of Vitamin D is typically sourced from lichen and is more effective at maintaining long-term serum 25(OH)D levels?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While D2 is plant-derived (fungi), vegan D3 (from lichen) is preferred in clinical practice because it is more effective at raising and sustaining blood levels of Vitamin D."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

                "Hot liquids denature plant proteins",
                "It causes rapid spikes in blood glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tannins in tea and coffee are potent inhibitors of non-heme iron. Consuming these beverages between meals rather than with meals helps prevent iron deficiency."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria, not plants. While other nutrients can be managed through diet, B12 must be supplemented or consumed via fortified foods to avoid permanent neurological damage."
