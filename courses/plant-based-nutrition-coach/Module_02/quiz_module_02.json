            "question": "Regarding the 'Complete Protein' myth, what is the physiological mechanism that allows plant-based eaters to meet all essential amino acid requirements without 'combining' proteins at every meal?",
            "options": [
                "The liver converts non-essential amino acids into essential ones",
                "The body maintains an endogenous amino acid pool through protein turnover and recycling",
                "Plant proteins are actually identical to animal proteins at a molecular level",
                "The gut microbiome synthesizes all nine essential amino acids from fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The body maintains a reservoir of amino acids (the endogenous pool) sourced from the breakdown of its own tissues and digestive secretions, which 'completes' the amino acid profile of individual meals throughout the day."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the most sensitive 'gold standard' for detecting a functional Vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly when serum B12 levels are in the 'low-normal' range?",
            "options": [
                "Serum B12 (Cobalamin)",
                "Hemoglobin levels",
                "Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)",
                "Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MMA levels rise when B12 is insufficient for cellular metabolism. It is a more specific and sensitive indicator of B12 status than serum levels, which can be falsely elevated by inactive analogues."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "To overcome the inhibitory effects of phytates and increase non-heme iron absorption by up to 3-4 times, what is the specific recommended 'synergy' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming calcium-rich tahini with every iron source",
                "Pairing 25-50mg of Vitamin C with iron-rich plant foods",
                "Drinking black tea immediately after a meal",
                "Avoiding all legumes during the menstrual cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) chemically reduces ferric iron to ferrous iron and prevents the formation of insoluble iron-phytate complexes, significantly boosting bioavailability."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Based on the physiological conversion limits discussed in Lesson 4, what is the typical conversion rate of ALA to DHA in healthy adult males?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 1%",
                "Approximately 5-10%",
                "Exactly 15%",
                "Over 25%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While ALA converts to EPA at rates of 5-8%, the conversion to DHA is extremely inefficient in males (often <1%), which is why direct algal oil supplementation is frequently recommended."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following vegetables has the highest calcium bioavailability (fractional absorption rate), despite having a lower total calcium content per gram than spinach?",

                "Beet Greens"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-oxalate cruciferous vegetables like Bok Choy have a calcium absorption rate of 50-60%, whereas high-oxalate spinach has an absorption rate of only about 5%."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client is concerned about Zinc absorption on a high-legume diet. Which preparation method is scientifically proven to most effectively reduce the phytate-to-zinc molar ratio?",
            "options": [
                "Dry roasting the legumes",
                "Freezing and thawing",
                "Soaking, sprouting, or fermentation",
                "Pureeing the legumes into a smooth paste"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Soaking and sprouting activate the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid, thereby releasing minerals like zinc and iron for better absorption."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Why is Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) generally preferred over Vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol) in a clinical plant-based context?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D2 is not absorbable by humans",
                "Vitamin D3 is more effective at raising and maintaining long-term serum 25(OH)D levels",
                "Vitamin D2 causes calcium stones in the kidneys",
                "Vitamin D3 is the only form that can be derived from lichen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that D3 is more potent and has a longer half-life in the bloodstream compared to D2, making it more effective for correcting deficiencies."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the 'Plate Method' application, what is the primary purpose of including a source of healthy fat (e.g., walnuts or seeds) with a meal rich in orange and dark green vegetables?",
            "options": [
                "To slow down protein digestion",
                "To facilitate the absorption of fat-soluble carotenoids and Vitamin K",
                "To provide the necessary glucose for brain function",
                "To neutralize the acidity of the vegetables"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Carotenoids (like beta-carotene) and Vitamin K are fat-soluble; consuming them with a small amount of dietary fat is essential for their transport and absorption in the small intestine."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kombu/Kelp has the highest iodine concentration of all sea vegetables and can easily lead to iodine toxicity or thyroid dysfunction if consumed daily in large amounts."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While protein and iron get the most attention, Iodine and Selenium are frequently overlooked in plant-based diets unless specific foods (iodized salt/seaweed and Brazil nuts) are intentionally included."
