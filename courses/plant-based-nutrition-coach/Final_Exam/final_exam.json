            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lysine is typically the limiting amino acid in grains (like rice and wheat). While protein combining at every meal is not necessary, ensuring lysine-rich foods like beans, lentils, and soy are consumed daily is vital for plant-based athletes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Serum B12 can stay within 'normal' ranges even when a deficiency is present at the cellular level. Elevated Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) is a specific and sensitive indicator of B12 deficiency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The conversion of ALA (found in flax/chia) to EPA is modest (5-10%), but the conversion to DHA is extremely low (often <1%), making algae-based DHA supplementation a consideration for many clients."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The hPDI studies demonstrate that while a whole-food plant-based diet reduces disease risk, a plant-based diet high in refined and sugary foods can actually increase the risk of chronic disease."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant-based diets can be beneficial for CKD due to lower acid load, but phosphorus and potassium must be monitored. Phytate-bound phosphorus in plants is absorbed less (approx. 50%) than inorganic phosphorus in processed foods."
