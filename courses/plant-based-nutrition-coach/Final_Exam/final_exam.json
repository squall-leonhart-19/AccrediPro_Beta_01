            "question": "Under the 'P' (Phytonutrient Synergy) of the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™, which combination is scientifically proven to increase the bioavailability of curcumin by up to 2,000%?",
            "options": [
                "Curcumin combined with piperine (black pepper)",
                "Curcumin combined with vitamin C (ascorbic acid)",
                "Curcumin combined with sulforaphane (broccoli)",
                "Curcumin combined with quercetin (onions)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that piperine, the active compound in black pepper, inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that would otherwise eliminate curcumin, increasing its bioavailability by 2,000%."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "The 'L' (Longevity Optimization) principle focuses on modulating cellular pathways. Which of the following best describes the effect of a whole-food plant-based diet on the mTOR and AMPK pathways?",
            "options": [
                "It tends to downregulate mTOR and upregulate AMPK, promoting cellular repair and autophagy.",
                "It upregulates mTOR and downregulates AMPK, promoting rapid muscle hypertrophy.",
                "It has no measurable effect on nutrient-sensing pathways compared to an omnivorous diet.",
                "It downregulates both mTOR and AMPK, leading to metabolic conservation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Plant-based diets, typically lower in leucine and methionine, help downregulate the growth-promoting mTOR pathway while activating the energy-sensing AMPK pathway, which is associated with increased longevity and cellular 'cleanup' (autophagy)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have consistently shown that plant-based dietary patterns are associated with significantly lower concentrations of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a key systemic marker of inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ANDI score measures micronutrients per calorie. Leafy greens like kale and spinach achieve the maximum score of 1,000, whereas processed foods or even some whole grains score significantly lower."

        {
            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "The 'T' (Therapeutic Whole Foods) principle emphasizes the 'food matrix.' How does the intact fiber in a whole apple differ from the isolated fiber added to a processed snack bar regarding metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "The whole food matrix slows gastric emptying and provides a more gradual glucose response.",
                "The isolated fiber is more bioavailable and thus more effective at lowering cholesterol.",
                "There is no difference; fiber is chemically identical regardless of the source.",
                "Isolated fiber has a higher thermic effect of food (TEF) than intact fiber."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The food matrix effect refers to how the physical structure of food dictates the rate of digestion. Intact fiber in whole fruits slows glucose absorption and improves insulin sensitivity compared to isolated fibers added to refined products."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Implementation intentions (If-Then planning) help clients navigate high-risk social or emotional situations by pre-deciding their response, which is a core component of sustainable lifestyle integration."

            "id": "final_7",
            "question": "When coaching a high-performance athlete (Module 8), what is the 'Leucine Threshold' typically required to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS), and how can a plant-based athlete reach it?",
            "options": [
                "2.5–3.0 grams; reached by consuming a variety of protein sources or leucine-rich plants like soy or lentils.",
                "0.5 grams; reached by any small serving of vegetables.",
                "10 grams; only possible through isolated leucine supplementation.",
                "5.0 grams; requires consuming at least 100g of protein per meal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The leucine threshold for MPS is generally 2.5–3.0g per meal. Plant-based athletes can achieve this by consuming larger servings of legumes, soy, or seitan, or by combining sources to ensure a complete amino acid profile."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "In Module 9 (Microbiome), the production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) is highlighted. Which SCFA is the primary energy source for colonocytes and is critical for maintaining gut barrier integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Butyrate",
                "Acetate",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the primary SCFA produced by the fermentation of prebiotic fibers in the gut; it provides energy for colon cells and helps prevent 'leaky gut' by strengthening tight junctions."

        {
            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "Regarding Metabolic Health (Module 10), what is the primary mechanism by which a low-fat, whole-food plant-based diet improves insulin sensitivity in Type 2 Diabetics?",

                "Increasing the acidity of the blood to facilitate glucose transport."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Intramyocellular lipids (fat droplets inside muscle cells) interfere with the insulin signaling pathway. A low-fat WFPB diet reduces these lipids, thereby 'unlocking' the cell and restoring insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "final_10",
            "question": "For a pregnant client (Module 11), which nutrient requires a 50% increase in RDA compared to non-pregnant states, often necessitating careful planning in plant-based diets?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The RDA for Iron increases from 18mg to 27mg during pregnancy (a 50% increase) to support increased blood volume and fetal development. Plant-based practitioners must emphasize non-heme iron sources paired with Vitamin C."

        {
            "id": "final_11",
            "question": "In the 'P' (Phytonutrient Synergy) protocol, why should crushed garlic be left to sit for 10 minutes before cooking?",
            "options": [
                "To allow the enzyme alliinase to create the active compound allicin.",
                "To allow the garlic to oxidize and reduce its sulfur content.",
                "To increase the vitamin K content through light exposure.",
                "To reduce the FODMAP content for better digestion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Allicin is formed when the precursor alliin and the enzyme alliinase interact. Heat deactivates the enzyme, so 'chopping and waiting' allows the reaction to complete before the garlic is cooked."

        {
            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "A client presents with high TMAO (Trimethylamine N-oxide) levels. Based on the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™, which dietary change will most effectively lower this cardiovascular risk marker?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "TMAO is produced when gut bacteria metabolize choline and carnitine (found in animal products). A plant-based diet reduces the specific bacteria that produce TMA and lacks the precursors found in meat and eggs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 50/50 rule ensures high nutrient density and low caloric density by filling half the plate with non-starchy vegetables, which provide bulk and satiety via stretch receptors in the stomach without excess calories."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cooking destroys myrosinase, the enzyme needed to produce the anti-cancer compound sulforaphane. Adding raw mustard seed powder (which contains active myrosinase) to cooked broccoli restores sulforaphane production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Plant sterols have a similar structure to cholesterol; they compete for space in micelles in the small intestine, thereby reducing the amount of cholesterol absorbed into the bloodstream."
