    {
      "letter": "P",
      "meaning": "Phytonutrient Synergy",
      "description": "Focuses on the complex biochemical interactions of plant compounds\u2014such as flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols\u2014that provide health benefits beyond basic macronutrients. Coaches learn to combine specific food groups to maximize the bioavailability and bioactive impact of these protective compounds."
