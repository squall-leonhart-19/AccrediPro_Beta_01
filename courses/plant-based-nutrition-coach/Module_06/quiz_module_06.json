            "question": "In the neurobiology of habit change (L1), which area of the brain is primarily responsible for the transition of a conscious action into an automatic 'chunked' routine?",
            "options": [
                "The Prefrontal Cortex",
                "The Basal Ganglia",

                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia is the center for habit formation and 'chunking,' allowing the Prefrontal Cortex to go into a 'sleep' mode once a routine is established."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that Vitamin C can increase the absorption of non-heme iron by 3 to 6 times by reducing ferric iron to the more soluble ferrous form."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses the 'Anti-Inflammatory Cascade.' Which phytochemical, found in cruciferous vegetables, requires the enzyme myrosinase for activation and is known for its potent Nrf2 pathway activation?",

                "Quercetin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is formed when glucoraphanin reacts with the enzyme myrosinase. It is a potent inducer of Phase II detoxification enzymes via the Nrf2 pathway."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes) and plays a vital role in preventing 'leaky gut' by strengthening tight junctions."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "For an active client (L5), what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal required to maximally stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in most adults?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Leucine Threshold is generally cited as 2.0g to 3.0g per meal. Plant-based athletes may need to consume larger total protein volumes or specific blends to hit this threshold."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Regarding nutrition across the lifespan (L6), why is Choline particularly emphasized for pregnant plant-based clients?",
            "options": [
                "It prevents iron-deficiency anemia",
                "It is essential for fetal neurodevelopment and neural tube closure",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline is critical for fetal brain development and gene expression. Because plant-based diets can be lower in choline (found heavily in eggs), intentional intake from soy, cruciferous vegetables, and beans is necessary."
