            "question": "In the neurobiology of the PLANT Method™, which brain structure is primarily responsible for the 'automation' phase, where behaviors transition from conscious effort to subconscious habit?",
            "options": [
                "Prefrontal Cortex",
                "Basal Ganglia",
                "Amygdala",
                "Hippocampus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the Prefrontal Cortex handles initial conscious decision-making, the Basal Ganglia is the neural center for habit formation and the execution of automated 'loops' (Cue-Action-Reward)."

            "question": "To maximize the bioavailability of sulforaphane in cooked cruciferous vegetables, which 'Nutrient Synergy' strategy should a coach recommend?",
            "options": [
                "Boiling the vegetables for at least 15 minutes",
                "Adding ground mustard seed (myrosinase source) to the cooked dish",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heat deactivates myrosinase, the enzyme needed to convert glucoraphanin to sulforaphane. Adding a raw source of myrosinase, like ground mustard seed, restores this conversion process in cooked vegetables."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diversity in plant intake is strongly correlated with a diverse microbiome and increased production of SCFAs like butyrate, which support gut barrier integrity and immune health."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It takes approximately 2–3 hours for nitrate to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria and then converted to nitric oxide in the blood to reach peak concentrations."

            "options": [
                "To compensate for decreased fiber absorption",
                "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' and mitigate sarcopenia",
                "Because plant proteins are toxic in low doses for seniors",
                "To reduce the workload on the kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging muscle requires a higher concentration of amino acids (particularly leucine) to trigger muscle protein synthesis, a phenomenon known as anabolic resistance."

            "options": [
                "Exactly equal to the loss of body mass",
                "Greater than what can be accounted for by the loss of lean and fat mass",

                "A myth that has been debunked by recent meta-analyses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis represents a metabolic 'slowdown' beyond what is predicted by weight loss alone, often driven by changes in leptin and thyroid hormones."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption, preventing the formation of insoluble iron compounds and reducing ferric iron to the more absorbable ferrous form."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The fermentation of fiber into SCFAs (like butyrate) signals the immune system to produce Tregs, which help maintain self-tolerance and reduce systemic inflammation."
