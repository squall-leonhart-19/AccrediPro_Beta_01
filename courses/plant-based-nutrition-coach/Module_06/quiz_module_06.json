            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "According to the 'Food Matrix' concept, why is a whole apple therapeutically superior to the equivalent amount of sugar and fiber in a processed juice?",
            "options": [
                "The cellular structure slows the rate of nutrient absorption and blunts the insulin response.",
                "The juice has lost all of its micronutrients during the pasteurization process.",
                "Fiber only works when it is chemically bonded to fructose molecules.",
                "The apple contains more water, which dilutes the caloric density by 50%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The food matrix refers to the physical structure of food; intact cells slow the release of sugars, leading to a more stable glycemic response compared to processed versions where the matrix is disrupted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In a clinical study comparing intact whole grains (e.g., whole rye kernels) to whole-grain flour, what was the primary finding regarding glycemic control?",
            "options": [
                "There was no difference because the fiber content remained identical.",
                "The whole-grain flour produced a significantly lower insulin spike due to surface area.",
                "The intact grains resulted in significantly lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels.",
                "The whole-grain flour was absorbed slower due to the fortification process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even if the fiber content is the same, the 'cellularity' of intact grains prevents rapid enzymatic access to starch, whereas flour (even whole-grain) has a high surface area that leads to rapid glucose absorption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "The 'Second Meal Effect' (lentil effect) refers to which physiological phenomenon observed with legume consumption?",
            "options": [
                "Eating legumes for breakfast increases the metabolic rate for exactly 24 hours.",
                "The fermentation of fiber in the colon produces short-chain fatty acids that improve glucose tolerance at a subsequent meal.",
                "Legumes stay in the stomach for 8 hours, preventing the hunger hormone ghrelin from rising.",
                "The high protein content of legumes requires more energy to digest than other plant foods."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Legumes contain fermentable fibers and resistant starch that are broken down by colonic bacteria into SCFAs (like butyrate), which improve insulin sensitivity for the next meal, even hours later."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client wants to maximize their intake of Resistant Starch Type 3 (RS3). Which preparation method should a P.L.A.N.T.S. coach recommend?",
            "options": [
                "Eating raw potatoes and green bananas exclusively.",
                "Cooking legumes in a high-pressure cooker for extended periods.",
                "Cooking starches like rice or potatoes, then cooling them in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours.",
                "Blending starchy vegetables into a smooth purée to increase surface area."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RS3 is 'retrograde starch,' which forms when certain starchy foods are cooked and then cooled, altering the chemical structure to make it resistant to human digestive enzymes."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Based on the NOVA classification system, why are many 'vegan meats' considered Ultra-Processed Foods (UPF/NOVA 4)?",
            "options": [
                "They are made from plants which are inherently processed by nature.",
                "They contain industrial formulations of oils, isolates, and additives with little to no intact whole foods.",
                "They are fermented, which automatically places them in the highest processing category.",
                "They contain more than 5 grams of protein per serving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NOVA 4 (Ultra-processed) foods are characterized by industrial ingredients (isolates, emulsifiers, flavors) and the absence of intact whole food structures, which are common in many commercial vegan alternatives."

                "A 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol within two weeks.",
                "A reduction of 10 mmHg in systolic and 7 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure.",
                "A total reversal of Type 1 Diabetes symptoms.",
                "An increase in bone mineral density by 15%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study (Rodriguez-Leyva et al.) demonstrated that flaxseed is one of the most potent anti-hypertensive foods, significantly reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

            "question": "What is the primary nutritional benefit of sprouting legumes and seeds before consumption?",
            "options": [
                "It eliminates 100% of the caloric content, making them 'zero-calorie' foods.",
                "It reduces anti-nutrients like phytic acid, significantly increasing the bioavailability of minerals like iron and zinc.",
                "It converts all the carbohydrates into saturated fats for better brain health.",
                "It increases the sodium content to help with electrolyte balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sprouting activates enzymes that break down phytates (phytic acid), which otherwise bind to minerals and inhibit their absorption in the digestive tract."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "When transitioning a client from a Standard American Diet to a high-fiber Whole Food Plant-Based diet, which strategy is best to minimize 'fiber bloat'?",
            "options": [
                "Starting with 60g of fiber on day one to 'shock' the microbiome into adapting.",

                "Avoiding all legumes and grains for the first six months of the transition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiome needs time to adjust its microbial populations to handle increased fiber. A gradual increase (Low and Slow) combined with hydration is the gold standard for clinical transition."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Which seed is uniquely high in 'lignans' (phytoestrogens), containing up to 800 times more than other plant foods, which may assist in hormone regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Hemp seeds",
                "Chia seeds",
                "Flaxseeds",
                "Sunflower seeds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flaxseeds are the richest dietary source of lignans, which have been studied for their role in breast and prostate health due to their weak estrogenic/anti-estrogenic effects."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A client presents with high triglycerides and poor satiety. According to the 'T' in the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™, which substitution would be most therapeutic?",
            "options": [
                "Replacing white rice with intact farro or groats.",
                "Replacing butter with vegan margarine made from palm oil.",
                "Replacing fruit with fruit-flavored gummy snacks.",
                "Replacing tap water with coconut water for the electrolytes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'T' stands for Therapeutic Whole Foods. Moving from a refined grain (white rice) to an intact grain (farro/groats) preserves the fiber and matrix, which helps lower triglycerides and increases satiety via the ileal brake mechanism."
