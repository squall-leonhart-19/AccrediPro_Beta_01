            "question": "According to the evolutionary perspective discussed in Lesson 1, what genetic adaptation distinguishes humans from most other primates regarding carbohydrate metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "The presence of the AMY1 gene, allowing for high production of salivary amylase",
                "The ability to synthesize Vitamin C endogenously in the liver",
                "A significantly shorter large intestine optimized for rapid protein fermentation",
                "The development of multi-chambered stomachs for cellulose breakdown"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Humans possess multiple copies of the AMY1 gene, which produces salivary amylase. This evolutionary adaptation allowed early humans to efficiently break down complex starches, a key factor in the transition to calorie-dense plant foods."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "The 'Food Matrix' concept (Lesson 2) suggests that the health impact of a nutrient is determined by:",
            "options": [
                "The total number of milligrams of the isolated active ingredient",
                "The physical and chemical structure in which nutrients are contained",
                "The speed at which the nutrient can be absorbed into the bloodstream",
                "The price and quality of the supplement manufacturing process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The food matrix refers to the complex assembly of nutrients and non-nutrients (like fiber and polyphenols) that interact physically and chemically, influencing how nutrients are released and absorbed."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3's discussion on macronutrients, what is the primary limitation of the PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score) compared to the newer DIAAS?",
            "options": [
                "PDCAAS does not account for the needs of children",
                "PDCAAS truncates scores at 1.0, potentially masking the superior quality of certain proteins",
                "PDCAAS only measures animal proteins and ignores plant sources",
                "PDCAAS measures nitrogen at the end of the digestive tract rather than at the ileum"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PDCAAS truncates scores at 1.0, which can make different protein sources appear equal when one might actually have a higher amino acid density. DIAAS provides a more accurate measure of individual amino acid digestibility at the ileum."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client is concerned about iron absorption on a vegan diet. Based on Lesson 4 (Bioavailability), which strategy provides the highest increase in non-heme iron absorption?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming 500mg of Calcium with every meal",
                "Drinking tea or coffee immediately after consuming iron-rich legumes",
                "Pairing 75mg of Vitamin C with an iron-rich meal to counteract phytates",
                "Switching from cooked spinach to raw spinach to preserve iron content"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption. Research shows that adding even modest amounts of Vitamin C (approx 75mg) can increase iron absorption by 3-4 times by reducing ferric iron to the more absorbable ferrous state."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Comparative anatomy (Lesson 5) reveals that the human intestinal tract length is approximately how many times the length of the torso, placing us closest to frugivores/herbivores?",
            "options": [
                "3 times (similar to a lion)",
                "6 times (similar to a hyena)",
                "10-12 times (similar to primates and herbivores)",
                "25 times (similar to a ruminant cow)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Human digestive tracts are roughly 10-12 times the length of the torso. This long, convoluted path is designed for the slow fermentation of fibrous plant materials, unlike the short, smooth tracts of carnivores (3-6x) designed for rapid meat transit."

            "options": [
                "A diet consisting of at least 30% animal protein",
                "Consistent consumption of 95-100% plant-based foods, specifically legumes",
                "High intake of refined grains for quick energy",
                "Daily consumption of processed soy isolates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Beans, Greens, Grains, and Nuts' foundation is central to Blue Zones. Specifically, legumes were found to be the cornerstone of every longevity diet, with plant-based intake averaging 95%."

            "options": [
                "Plant proteins must be combined at every meal to be utilized",
                "The body maintains a reservoir of amino acids that can be drawn upon to complement proteins over a 24-hour period",
                "Only soy and quinoa contain all essential amino acids; all other plants lack at least three",
                "Plant proteins are missing essential amino acids entirely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The body maintains an 'amino acid pool.' As long as a variety of plant foods are consumed throughout the day, the body can successfully synthesize all necessary proteins without 'complementing' at every single meal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'L' in the P.L.A.N.T.S. Method™ stands for Longevity-Focus, which involves selecting whole foods and patterns proven in longitudinal studies to reduce all-cause mortality."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module examined the impact of plant-based diets on Type 2 Diabetes. What was the specific finding regarding HbA1c reduction?",
            "options": [
                "No significant difference compared to a standard omnivorous diet",
                "An average reduction of 0.67% to 0.84% in HbA1c levels",
                "A temporary reduction that reversed after 3 months",
                "An increase in HbA1c due to high fruit sugar intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data consistently shows that whole-food, plant-based diets significantly lower HbA1c, often outperforming standard diabetic diets by 0.67% to 0.84% due to improved insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which 'antinutrient' found in spinach and beet greens can significantly inhibit calcium absorption if these foods are consumed raw in large quantities?",
            "options": [
                "Phytic Acid",
                "Lectins",

                "Glucosinolates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxalates (oxalic acid) bind to calcium, forming calcium oxalate, which the body cannot absorb. While cooking reduces oxalate levels, raw high-oxalate greens have very low calcium bioavailability compared to low-oxalate greens like kale or bok choy."
