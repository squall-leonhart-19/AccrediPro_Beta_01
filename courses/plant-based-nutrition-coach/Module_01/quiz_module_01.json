            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights 'Component Prepping' as a superior meal planning system for many clients. What is the primary benefit of this system over 'Recipe Prepping'?",
            "options": ["It requires fewer ingredients to be purchased", "It eliminates the need for any cooking during the week", "It reduces 'palate fatigue' by allowing for flexible meal assembly", "It ensures that every meal has the exact same caloric density"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Component prepping (preparing batches of grains, beans, and veggies) allows for various combinations throughout the week, preventing the boredom often associated with eating the same pre-made recipe for five days."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'dry sauté' method involves heating the pan first, adding vegetables, and then using small amounts of liquid (1-2 tablespoons at a time) to deglaze the pan as the natural sugars caramelize."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crowding out is a positive-reinforcement strategy where the focus is on abundance (adding more beans, greens, and grains) rather than the deprivation of removing foods."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the course indicates that 'Implementation Intentions' (If-Then planning) can significantly improve dietary adherence. Which of the following is a valid 'If-Then' plan for a social situation?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) significantly enhances the absorption of non-heme iron. Pairing iron-rich legumes with Vitamin C-rich citrus or peppers can increase absorption by up to 3-6 times."
