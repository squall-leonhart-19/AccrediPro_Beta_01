            "question": "According to behavioral psychology principles discussed in Lesson 1, which strategy is most effective for long-term adherence to a plant-based lifestyle?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on 'Outcome Goals' like weight loss",
                "Implementing 'Identity-Based Habits' where the client views themselves as a plant-based eater",
                "Using 'Willpower-Dependent' restriction of all non-compliant foods immediately",
                "Relying on external motivation from social media influencers"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on who we believe we are (e.g., 'I am a person who eats plants') rather than just what we want to achieve. This shift in self-perception is more durable than outcome-based goals or willpower alone."

            "question": "In Lesson 2, kitchen optimization was emphasized. What is the primary functional advantage of a high-speed blender (1500+ watts) in a plant-based kitchen?",
            "options": [
                "It uses less electricity than a standard blender",
                "It is the only way to cook vegetables to preserve vitamins",
                "It can pulverize cell walls (cellulose) of nuts and greens, increasing nutrient bioavailability and creating creamier textures",
                "It replaces the need for a refrigerator by keeping food cold during processing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-speed blenders are essential for plant-based cooking because they can emulsify cashews into cream and break down the tough cellulose in leafy greens, making nutrients more accessible and textures more palatable."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When teaching a client Label Literacy (Lesson 5), the '5:20 Rule' is a critical tool. A food is considered 'High' in a specific nutrient if the Daily Value (DV) is:",
            "options": [
                "5% or less",
                "Exactly 10%",
                "20% or more",
                "Over 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 5:20 Rule is a quick guide for reading labels: 5% DV or less is considered 'Low' in that nutrient, while 20% DV or more is considered 'High'."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 introduced the 'Component-Based' batch cooking system. How does this differ from 'Recipe-Based' meal prep?",
            "options": [
                "It involves cooking 21 individual meals on a Sunday",
                "It focuses on preparing versatile 'building blocks' (grains, legumes, sauces) that can be mixed and matched",
                "It requires buying only pre-packaged frozen components",
                "It is designed only for professional chefs, not home cooks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Component-based prep involves cooking large batches of staples (like a pot of quinoa, roasted chickpeas, and a tahini dressing) which prevents 'recipe boredom' and allows for quick, varied assembly during the week."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "To achieve the Maillard reaction (browning) when sautéing vegetables without oil (Lesson 6), which technique is most effective?",
            "options": [
                "Boiling the vegetables in a large amount of water first",
                "Using a non-stick pan and adding vegetables to a cold surface",
                "Dry-searing in a preheated pan and deglazing with small amounts of broth or water only when sticking occurs",
                "Adding oil-free salad dressing to the pan at the start of cooking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Maillard reaction requires heat. By dry-searing in a hot pan, you allow the natural sugars in vegetables to caramelize. Deglazing with liquid (water/broth) releases those flavors back into the food without the need for oil."

                "Counting every calorie to ensure weight loss occurs rapidly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crowding out is a psychological and nutritional strategy where the focus is on 'abundance' (adding more beans, greens, and grains) rather than 'deprivation,' leading to a more sustainable transition."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Lesson 3 identified 'Pantry Foundations.' Which of these is considered a 'Nutritional Powerhouse' staple due to its high fiber and protein content (approx. 18g protein per cooked cup)?",
            "options": [
                "White Rice",
                "Lentils",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lentils are a foundational pantry staple in plant-based nutrition, providing significant protein and fiber, and they cook much faster than most other dried legumes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Host-First' strategy involves proactive communication and contribution, reducing the burden on the host while ensuring you have a high-quality meal to eat."

            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies in consumer behavior show that intentional planning and inventory-based shopping typically reduce household food waste by 20-25%, which also significantly lowers the grocery bill."

                "Coconut milk and vanilla extract"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Umami is the 'savory' fifth taste. Miso, nutritional yeast, and fermented soy products (tamari) are rich in glutamates that provide the depth of flavor often associated with meat or aged cheeses."
