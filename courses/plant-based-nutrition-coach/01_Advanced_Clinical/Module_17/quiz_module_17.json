            "question": "When managing a client with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), why is a plant-based diet often preferred over a meat-based diet regarding phosphorus management?",
            "options": [
                "Plant-based foods contain no phosphorus compared to animal products.",
                "Phosphorus in plants is bound to phytates, resulting in an absorption rate of only 30-50%.",
                "Plant-based phosphorus is absorbed at a rate of 80-100%, stimulating better kidney filtration.",
                "The kidneys do not need to filter phosphorus from plant sources due to their alkaline nature."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In plant-based foods, phosphorus is largely bound to phytates, which humans lack the enzyme (phytase) to break down efficiently. This results in a lower bioavailability (30-50%) compared to the 70-80% absorption rate of phosphorus in animal tissues and nearly 100% in inorganic additives."

            "question": "A client with Metabolic Syndrome presents with a high HOMA-IR score. According to the module, what is the primary mechanism by which a low-fat, whole-food plant-based diet (WFPB) reverses insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the intake of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).",
                "By reducing intramyocellular lipids, thereby restoring the insulin signaling pathway.",
                "By eliminating all carbohydrates to prevent glucose spikes.",
                "By increasing systemic inflammation to stimulate a metabolic response."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intramyocellular lipids (fat inside muscle cells) interfere with the insulin signaling process. A low-fat WFPB diet reduces these lipid stores, allowing insulin to effectively 'unlock' the cell for glucose entry, thus reversing insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "For a client with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which specific dietary component produced by the fermentation of fiber has been shown to modulate T-regulatory cells and reduce systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs)",
                "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate",
                "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)",
                "Omega-6 arachidonic acid"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate, are produced when gut bacteria ferment dietary fiber. SCFAs help maintain the gut barrier and promote the production of T-regulatory cells, which suppress the overactive immune response seen in autoimmune conditions like RA."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "During an acute flare-up of Crohn’s Disease (IBD), what is the clinically recommended temporary modification to a plant-based diet?",
            "options": [
                "Transitioning to a raw-only fruit and vegetable diet.",
                "Increasing insoluble fiber intake to 50g+ per day to 'clear' the tract.",
                "Implementing a low-residue/low-fiber plant-based diet with peeled, cooked, and blended foods.",
                "Complete fasting for 7 days with only water and black coffee."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During an IBD flare, the bowel is inflamed and often narrowed. A temporary low-residue diet (reducing fiber, peeling skins, cooking thoroughly) minimizes mechanical irritation and prevents obstruction while still providing plant-based nutrients."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In the context of plant-based oncology support, how does a high-fiber intake correlate with breast cancer survivorship according to recent meta-analyses?",
            "options": [
                "Fiber has no effect on cancer survivorship, only on prevention.",
                "High fiber intake is associated with a 50% increase in IGF-1 levels.",
                "Every 10g increase in daily fiber is associated with an approximate 13% reduction in all-cause mortality.",
                "Fiber should be avoided during chemotherapy as it interferes with drug absorption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that for breast cancer survivors, every 10g increase in daily fiber intake is linked to a significant reduction in mortality risk, likely due to fiber’s ability to bind excess estrogen and lower systemic inflammation."

            "question": "An ultra-endurance plant-based athlete is struggling with 'hitting the wall' during 4-hour training runs. What is the recommended carbohydrate intake for optimal glycogen maintenance in this population?",
            "options": [
                "1-2 grams per kilogram of body weight per day.",
                "8-12 grams per kilogram of body weight per day.",
                "No more than 50 grams per day to encourage fat adaptation.",
                "Carbohydrates are irrelevant as long as protein intake is 3.0g/kg."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For ultra-endurance athletes (training 4-5+ hours/day), carbohydrate requirements are high (8-12g/kg/day) to ensure glycogen stores are replenished. A WFPB diet is naturally high in carbohydrates, making it ideal for this requirement."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A pregnant plant-based client is concerned about Choline intake. What is the Adequate Intake (AI) for Choline during pregnancy, and which plant food is a significant source?",
            "options": [
                "250mg/day; White rice",
                "450mg/day; Roasted soybeans (edamame) or cruciferous vegetables",
                "1,000mg/day; Apples",
                "Choline is not required for fetal brain development."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AI for Choline during pregnancy is 450mg/day. While found in high amounts in eggs, plant-based sources like soybeans, tofu, quinoa, and cruciferous vegetables are essential for fetal neurodevelopment in vegan pregnancies."

            "question": "When working with a client exhibiting signs of Orthorexia Nervosa (ON), what is the most appropriate course of action for a Nutrition Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Provide more strict meal plans to ensure they are eating 'perfectly.'",
                "Encourage the client to fast to 'reset' their relationship with food.",
                "Refer the client to a specialized mental health professional or eating disorder registered dietitian.",
                "Ignore the behavior as long as the client is losing weight."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orthorexia Nervosa involves an unhealthy obsession with 'pure' or 'correct' eating. Because this is a psychological condition, it is outside a nutrition coach's scope of practice and requires referral to a licensed mental health professional."

            "question": "A client with SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) wants to remain plant-based. Which strategy is most effective for managing symptoms during the 'Kill Phase' of treatment?",
            "options": [
                "A high-fructose fruitarian diet.",
                "A Monash-certified Low-FODMAP plant-based protocol.",
                "Drinking 2 liters of celery juice daily.",
                "Eliminating all cooked vegetables and eating only raw kale."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Low-FODMAP plant-based protocol reduces the fermentable carbohydrates that feed the overgrowth in the small intestine, helping to manage bloating and pain while the underlying SIBO is treated."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "In pediatric plant-based nutrition, what is a critical strategy to ensure a toddler meets their caloric needs despite their small stomach capacity and the high bulk of a WFPB diet?",
            "options": [
                "Limit all fats to less than 10% of calories.",
                "Ensure at least 60g of fiber per day to promote digestion.",
                "Focus on energy-dense additions like nut butters, seeds, and avocado.",
                "Replace all solid foods with fruit juice."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Toddlers have high energy needs but small stomachs. Because a WFPB diet is fiber-rich and bulky, it can lead to premature satiety. Including energy-dense healthy fats ensures they meet their caloric requirements for growth."
