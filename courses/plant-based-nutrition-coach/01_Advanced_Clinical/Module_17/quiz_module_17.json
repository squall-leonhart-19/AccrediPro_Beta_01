            "question": "For a client with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), why is the phosphorus found in whole plant foods (phytates) considered safer than phosphorus additives in processed meats?",
            "options": [
                "Plant phosphorus has a higher bioavailability of 90%.",
                "Phytate-bound phosphorus has a low absorption rate of only 10-30% in humans.",
                "Plant phosphorus is excreted via the lungs rather than the kidneys.",
                "Phytates convert phosphorus into Vitamin D within the gut."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike inorganic phosphorus additives which are absorbed at nearly 100%, phosphorus in whole plants is bound to phytates, which humans lack the enzyme to fully digest, resulting in only 10-30% absorption."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to the 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2, what is the primary mechanism by which a high-fiber, plant-based diet reverses insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) which improve insulin signaling.",
                "By eliminating all carbohydrates to prevent glucose spikes.",
                "By increasing circulating IGF-1 levels to stimulate muscle growth.",
                "By reducing the body's need for mitochondrial respiration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Short-chain fatty acids (like butyrate) produced by fiber fermentation activate G-protein coupled receptors that improve insulin sensitivity and reduce systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) experiences a 'flare' after introducing large amounts of raw cruciferous vegetables. What is the most likely physiological explanation?",
            "options": [
                "Cruciferous vegetables are strictly pro-inflammatory for all RA patients.",
                "The sudden increase in fiber may have caused transient dysbiosis or 'die-off' in a compromised gut barrier.",
                "Sulforaphane inhibits the production of T-regulatory cells.",
                "Raw vegetables contain high levels of purines that cause immediate joint swelling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In autoimmune conditions involving 'leaky gut,' a rapid increase in fiber can overwhelm the microbiome, causing temporary distress or immune activation before the gut adapts."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "When managing a client with SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) on a plant-based diet, what is the recommended approach for legume consumption?",
            "options": [
                "Complete permanent removal of all legumes.",
                "Switching to dry-beans only to increase lectin intake.",
                "Using canned, well-rinsed lentils/chickpeas in small portions (1/4 cup) to reduce GOS content.",
                "Consuming legumes only in raw, sprouted form to maximize enzyme activity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Canned legumes are lower in fermentable Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) because the sugars leach into the canning liquid, making them better tolerated during the 'Low-FODMAP' phase of SIBO management."

                "Fiber should be limited to 10g per day to save energy for healing.",
                "Consuming at least 30g of fiber daily significantly reduces the risk of colorectal cancer by diluting carcinogens.",
                "Fiber is only useful for weight loss, not cancer prevention.",
                "Fiber should only come from supplements, not whole foods, during chemotherapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) emphasizes 30g+ of fiber as a primary prevention strategy for colorectal and other obesity-related cancers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maintain glycogen stores during extreme volume (20+ hours/week), ultra-endurance athletes require high-end carbohydrate availability, typically 8-12 g/kg."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choline is essential for neurodevelopment and lipid metabolism. Plant-based sources include soy, quinoa, and cruciferous vegetables, but supplementation is often necessary to meet the 450-550mg requirement."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Pediatrics, why is the '1.8x multiplier' applied to the RDA for iron in plant-based children?",
            "options": [
                "Plant-based children exercise more and sweat out iron.",
                "To account for the lower bioavailability of non-heme iron compared to heme iron.",
                "Because plant-based children have faster bone growth.",
                "To counteract the iron-leaching effects of soy protein."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Institute of Medicine suggests that because non-heme iron is less easily absorbed, vegetarians should aim for 1.8 times the standard RDA."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During an IBD flare, a 'low-residue' or low-fiber plant-based approach reduces the volume of stool and mechanical irritation of the inflamed bowel wall while providing necessary glucose for training."
