            "question": "According to the principles of nutrient synergy, adding 1 gram of ground mustard seed to cooked broccoli can increase the bioavailability of sulforaphane by approximately how much?",
            "options": [
                "It has no significant effect",
                "Approximately 2 times",
                "Approximately 4 times",
                "Over 10 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mustard seeds contain active myrosinase, which is heat-sensitive and destroyed in cooked broccoli. Adding raw mustard seed powder to cooked cruciferous vegetables restores the enzyme activity, increasing sulforaphane bioavailability by roughly 400% (4x)."

            "question": "In the context of Precision Chrono-Nutrition, why is it recommended to consume the majority of daily carbohydrates before 3:00 PM?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrates are only absorbed in the morning",
                "Insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food (TEF) are higher in the biological morning",
                "Melatonin production requires an empty stomach to begin",
                "To prevent the conversion of glucose into glycogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Human circadian rhythms dictate that insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are significantly higher in the morning. Consuming large carbohydrate loads in the evening, when melatonin begins to rise and insulin sensitivity drops, can lead to impaired glucose tolerance."

            "question": "A client has a GSTM1 'null' genotype. Based on nutrigenomic research, how should their plant-based diet be adjusted?",
            "options": [
                "They should avoid all cruciferous vegetables due to toxicity",
                "They require a significantly higher intake of cruciferous vegetables to compensate for reduced detoxification enzyme activity",
                "They should eliminate all sources of dietary fat",
                "They require high-dose synthetic Vitamin C supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with the GSTM1 null genotype lack a specific glutathione S-transferase enzyme. Research shows these individuals derive a significantly higher protective benefit from increased cruciferous vegetable intake (isothiocyanates) compared to those with the 'present' genotype."

                "Valerate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel source for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes). It plays a critical role in maintaining gut barrier integrity and inducing apoptosis in cancerous colon cells."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phytohormesis is the process where low doses of 'toxic' plant compounds trigger a beneficial adaptive stress response in humans, primarily through the Nrf2 pathway, which upregulates the body's endogenous antioxidant defenses."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "For an elite plant-based athlete using beetroot juice for performance optimization, when is the 'ergogenic window' for peak plasma nitrite levels?",
            "options": [
                "15-30 minutes post-ingestion",
                "2-3 hours post-ingestion",

                "Exactly 24 hours post-ingestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nitrate from beetroot juice is converted to nitrite by oral bacteria. Plasma nitrite levels typically peak between 2 and 3 hours after consumption, making this the optimal window for athletic performance."

                "Cooking the rice in a microwave"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'parboiling with initial absorption' method involves soaking rice, draining it, and then cooking it in a large volume of water (5:1 ratio) and draining the excess, which significantly reduces arsenic levels compared to the traditional absorption method."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Bliss Point' is a term used in food science to describe the precise optimization of salt, sugar, and fat that overrides the body's internal satiety signals and triggers intense dopamine release, often leading to overconsumption."

            "question": "To maximize the absorption of non-heme iron from a plant-based meal, which of the following combinations is most effective based on clinical data?",
            "options": [
                "Lentils with a cup of strong black tea",
                "Spinach with 50mg of Vitamin C (e.g., a squeeze of lemon juice)",

                "Beans consumed with raw kale only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption. Adding as little as 50mg of Vitamin C to a meal can increase iron absorption by 3-6 times, while polyphenols in tea and calcium supplements can inhibit it."

                "Are at higher risk for atherosclerosis due to high fruit intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have demonstrated that vegans/vegetarians do not have the specific gut microbial species required to convert L-carnitine or choline into TMA (the precursor to TMAO). Even when fed a steak or high-choline meal, their TMAO levels remain significantly lower than those of omnivores."
