            "question": "To overcome the inhibitory effects of phytates on zinc absorption in a grain-heavy diet, which advanced preparation technique yields the highest increase in mineral bioaccessibility?",
            "options": [
                "Dry roasting for 10 minutes",
                "Lactic acid fermentation (sourdough process)",

                "Freezing the grains for 24 hours prior to cooking"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fermentation activates endogenous phytases and lowers pH, which significantly degrades phytates and increases zinc and iron bioaccessibility more effectively than simple soaking or roasting."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of Precision Chrono-Nutrition, why is postprandial glucose response typically higher when a high-carbohydrate plant-based meal is consumed at 8:00 PM versus 8:00 AM?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin secretion inhibits insulin release from the pancreas",
                "The microbiome becomes dormant at night",

                "Cortisol levels are at their peak in the late evening"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors are present on pancreatic beta cells; rising melatonin levels in the evening inhibit insulin secretion, leading to reduced glucose tolerance at night."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'slow converter' genotype for the FADS2 gene. Based on Nutrigenomics, what is the most appropriate nutritional recommendation for their Omega-3 status?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FADS2 gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for converting ALA to EPA/DHA. Individuals with specific polymorphisms have very low conversion rates (often <1%) and require pre-formed long-chain omega-3s."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred fuel for the colonic epithelium and plays a master role in epigenetic signaling (HDAC inhibition) that promotes immune tolerance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane acts as a pro-oxidant stressor that triggers the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) pathway, leading to the upregulation of Phase II detoxification enzymes."

                "The Occipital Lobe"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia is responsible for habit formation and procedural behaviors. Moving dietary choices from conscious 'effort' (Prefrontal Cortex) to 'identity' (Basal Ganglia) reduces cognitive load and improves adherence."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mustard seeds are rich in myrosinase. Adding a small amount of raw mustard powder to cooked broccoli allows the conversion of glucoraphanin into the active compound sulforaphane."

            "question": "According to advanced microbiome research, a 'High-Diversity' plant-based diet (30+ different plants per week) is superior to a 'High-Fiber' diet of only 3 sources because:",
            "options": [
                "It prevents the overgrowth of Akkermansia muciniphila",
                "Different fibers support distinct microbial niches, preventing 'competitive exclusion'",
                "It reduces the total caloric density of the diet",
                "It increases the production of TMAO in the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diversity in plant intake provides a varied substrate profile (polyphenols and prebiotic fibers), which supports a wider range of bacterial species and prevents a single species from dominating the ecosystem."
