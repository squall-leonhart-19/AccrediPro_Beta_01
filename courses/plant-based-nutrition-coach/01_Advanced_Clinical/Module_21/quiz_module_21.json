            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While serum B12 is commonly tested, Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) is the more sensitive functional marker for B12 deficiency at the cellular level, which is critical for plant-based practitioners to monitor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digestive repair requires gradual titration of fiber and processing techniques (soaking, sprouting, or blending) to allow the microbiome to adapt to increased prebiotic loads."
