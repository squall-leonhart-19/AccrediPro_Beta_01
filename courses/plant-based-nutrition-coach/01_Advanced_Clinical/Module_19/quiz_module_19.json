            "question": "In the Hierarchy of Evidence, why are Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) positioned above individual RCTs?",
            "options": [
                "They use larger sample sizes from a single study to increase power.",
                "They aggregate data from multiple high-quality studies to minimize bias and increase statistical power.",
                "They rely on expert opinion to interpret conflicting laboratory data.",
                "They are easier to conduct than individual clinical trials."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses sit at the top of the hierarchy because they synthesize the results of multiple studies, providing a more robust and reliable conclusion than any single study could offer."

            "question": "Data from the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) involving over 96,000 participants found that vegans had an average BMI that was how many points lower than non-vegetarians?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 1.5 points lower",
                "Approximately 2.0 points lower",
                "Approximately 5.0 points lower",
                "There was no significant difference in BMI"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AHS-2 data showed that vegans had a mean BMI of 23.6 kg/m², while non-vegetarians had a mean BMI of 28.8 kg/m², a difference of roughly 5 points, placing the vegan group in the 'normal' range while the non-vegetarian group was 'overweight'."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The EPIC-Oxford study found that vegetarians had a 32% lower risk of ischemic heart disease, likely due to lower non-HDL cholesterol levels and lower systolic blood pressure."

            "question": "In Dr. Dean Ornish’s Lifestyle Heart Trial, what was the primary finding regarding coronary artery stenosis after one year of an intensive plant-based lifestyle intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Stenosis progressed in both the control and intervention groups.",
                "Stenosis remained stable only in the group taking high-dose statins.",
                "Diameter stenosis regressed (decreased) from 40.0% to 37.8% in the experimental group.",
                "The intervention group showed no change, while the control group regressed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Lifestyle Heart Trial was landmark because it showed that coronary atherosclerosis could be reversed (regressed) through intensive lifestyle changes, including a low-fat plant-based diet, without lipid-lowering drugs."

            "id": "q19_5",

            "options": [
                "By increasing the intake of heme iron to boost energy metabolism.",
                "By reducing intramyocellular lipids (fat inside muscle cells) which interfere with insulin signaling.",
                "By slowing down the basal metabolic rate to conserve glucose.",
                "By eliminating all carbohydrates to prevent insulin spikes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., by Dr. Neal Barnard) has shown that reducing dietary fat helps clear intramyocellular lipids, which restores the insulin signaling pathway and improves glucose uptake."

                "Everyone responds identically to the same macronutrient ratios.",
                "Genetics are the only factor determining blood sugar spikes.",
                "There is high inter-individual variability in postprandial responses, influenced significantly by the gut microbiome.",
                "The gut microbiome has no impact on how we process dietary fats."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PREDICT-1 study highlighted that even identical twins have different metabolic responses to the same foods, emphasizing the role of the gut microbiome and individual biology in nutrition."

            "question": "When evaluating the bioavailability of plant-based protein, what does the 'DIAAS' (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score) typically indicate for isolated soy protein compared to beef?",
            "options": [
                "Soy protein has a score of zero.",
                "Soy protein is significantly higher than beef in all categories.",
                "Isolated soy protein is highly digestible and comparable to animal proteins (often >0.90).",
                "Plant proteins cannot be absorbed by the human digestive tract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While some whole plant foods have lower digestibility due to fiber/anti-nutrients, isolated soy protein and other concentrates have high DIAAS scores, making them highly efficient protein sources."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Critical appraisal requires looking for industry influence, as studies funded by industry are significantly more likely to produce results favorable to the funder's product."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The BROAD study was notable because participants lost significant weight and improved cholesterol levels while eating ad libitum (as much as they wanted) of WFPB foods, without restrictive calorie counting."
