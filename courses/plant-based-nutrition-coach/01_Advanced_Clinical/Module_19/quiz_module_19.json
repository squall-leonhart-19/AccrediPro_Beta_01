            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While meta-analyses of RCTs sit at the very top, individual Randomized Controlled Trials are the gold standard for establishing causality because they minimize confounding variables through randomization."

            "question": "The Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) found that vegans had a significantly lower risk of Type 2 Diabetes compared to non-vegetarians. What was the approximate risk reduction observed in this cohort?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EPIC-Oxford reported that vegetarians and vegans had a 32% lower risk of ischemic heart disease, likely due to lower non-HDL cholesterol levels and lower systolic blood pressure."

                "Regression was only seen in participants under age 40"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Lifestyle Heart Trial was groundbreaking for showing that coronary atherosclerosis could actually regress (7.9% average) through intensive lifestyle changes without the use of lipid-lowering drugs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The low-fat vegan group saw a 1.23-point drop in HbA1c, which was significantly greater than the 0.38-point drop seen in the group following the standard American Diabetes Association guidelines."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "The PREDICT-1 study (Personalized Responses to Dietary Composition Trial) highlighted that individuals, including identical twins, respond differently to the same foods. What did this study identify as a major driver of these differences?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PREDICT studies showed that the gut microbiome, along with sleep, exercise, and meal timing, played a larger role in postprandial metabolic responses than genetics alone."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When examining nutrient kinetics, how does the addition of 75mg of Vitamin C to a plant-based meal affect the absorption of non-heme iron?",
            "options": [
                "It has no measurable effect",
                "It decreases absorption by binding to phytates",
                "It can increase absorption by 3-4 times",
                "It only works if the iron is from a supplement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a potent enhancer of non-heme iron absorption; adding modest amounts can increase absorption several-fold by reducing ferric iron to the more absorbable ferrous state."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is 'Healthy User Bias,' and why is it a critical consideration when appraising observational studies on plant-based diets?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency for researchers to only publish positive results",
                "The fact that people who choose plant-based diets often engage in other healthy behaviors like not smoking",

                "The bias created when a study is funded by the broccoli industry"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healthy User Bias is a type of confounding where the observed health benefit may be due to a cluster of healthy behaviors (exercise, avoiding tobacco) rather than the diet alone."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AHS-2 found that vegan diets were particularly protective for Black men, showing a 35% reduction in prostate cancer risk, a significant finding given the higher baseline risk in this population."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.05 indicates that there is a 5% probability that the observed difference between groups occurred by chance. It measures statistical significance, not clinical magnitude."
