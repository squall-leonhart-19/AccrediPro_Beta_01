            "question": "In the management of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), a 2023 meta-analysis of plant-based interventions demonstrated that a fiber intake exceeding 35g per day resulted in what specific outcome regarding insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in fasting glucose levels",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-fiber plant-based diets are clinically proven to improve HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) by approximately 25-30% due to improved short-chain fatty acid production and delayed glucose absorption."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 55-year-old male client with Grade 2 Hypertension and a history of stable angina (Lesson 2 Case Study) transitions to a whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diet.

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Plant-based diets rich in nitrates (leafy greens, beets) and antioxidants restore the endothelial glycocalyx and increase Nitric Oxide bioavailability, leading to improved vasodilation."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When addressing the Gut-Immune Axis in autoimmune protocols (Lesson 3), which compound found in processed foods is most associated with 'leaky gut' and the exacerbation of molecular mimicry?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS from certain bacteria and synthetic emulsifiers can compromise the intestinal barrier, allowing undigested proteins to enter the bloodstream and trigger autoimmune responses through molecular mimicry."

                "Plant proteins cannot trigger the mTOR pathway"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Trigger' hypothesis suggests that 2.5-3.0g of leucine is required per meal to maximize MPS. Plant-based athletes achieve this by consuming larger portions or combining lysine-rich legumes with leucine-rich grains/soy."

                "Complete avoidance of all legumes indefinitely"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For IBD patients, the gradual introduction of soluble fiber and mechanical breakdown (blending/cooking) reduces mechanical irritation while still providing the prebiotics necessary for butyrate-producing bacteria."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Regarding PCOS management (Lesson 6), research indicates that a high-fiber, low-glycemic plant-based diet can reduce circulating free testosterone by which primary mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "By improving insulin sensitivity, a plant-based diet stimulates the liver to produce more SHBG, which binds to excess testosterone, thereby reducing the symptoms of hyperandrogenism in PCOS."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, older adults require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5 g/kg) than younger adults to maintain the same level of muscle protein synthesis."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 2 highlighted a 45% reduction in hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) after 8 weeks on a WFPB diet. What does this marker primarily indicate?",
