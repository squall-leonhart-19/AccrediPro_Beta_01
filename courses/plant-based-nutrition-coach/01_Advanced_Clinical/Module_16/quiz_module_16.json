            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the management of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), a 2021 meta-analysis indicated that a low-fat WFPB diet can reduce HbA1c by an average of how much compared to standard care?",
            "options": ["0.1% - 0.2%", "0.6% - 0.8%", "1.5% - 2.0%", "3.0% - 4.0%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical data consistently shows that high-fiber, low-fat plant-based interventions typically result in an HbA1c reduction of 0.6% to 0.8%, which is comparable to some first-line pharmaceutical interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to the cardiovascular restoration protocols (Lesson 2), which metabolite produced by gut microbiota from carnitine and choline is a target for reduction to prevent atherosclerosis?",
            "options": ["Butyrate", "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)", "Propionate", "Sulforaphane"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TMAO is a pro-atherogenic metabolite produced by gut bacteria from animal-based precursors; a WFPB diet shifts the microbiome to significantly lower TMAO production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the context of the 'Gut-Immune Axis' (Lesson 3), which protein's dysregulation is primarily responsible for the 'leaky gut' associated with autoimmune triggers?",
            "options": ["Zonulin", "Albumin", "Hemoglobin", "Casein"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract wall; high levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability and autoimmune activation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "To achieve optimal muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in elite plant-based athletes, what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal?",
            "options": ["0.5g - 1.0g", "1.2g - 1.8g", "2.5g - 3.0g", "5.0g+"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To overcome the lower leucine content in some plant proteins, athletes should aim for 2.5g to 3.0g of leucine per meal to effectively trigger the mTOR pathway for hypertrophy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "For a client with IBD in an active flare (Lesson 5), which dietary transition step is most appropriate before reintroducing high-fiber legumes?",
            "options": ["Immediate high-fiber loading", "Raw cruciferous vegetable juice", "Low-residue, cooked, and peeled plant foods", "High-fat ketogenic plant-based diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During an IBD flare, a low-residue (low fiber) approach using well-cooked, peeled, and non-gas-forming plant foods is necessary to reduce mechanical irritation before transitioning to a standard WFPB diet."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "How does a WFPB diet specifically assist in the management of PCOS-related hormonal imbalances?",
            "options": ["By decreasing Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)", "By increasing insulin resistance to stabilize glucose", "By increasing SHBG, which binds to and lowers free testosterone", "By eliminating all sources of phytoestrogens"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-fiber diets increase SHBG levels, which helps bind excess circulating androgens (like testosterone) that drive PCOS symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In pediatric nutrition (Lesson 7), what is the primary concern for a child's growth if caloric density is too low due to excessive fiber intake?",
            "options": ["Early puberty", "Early satiety leading to growth faltering", "Excessive bone mineralization", "Vitamin C toxicity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because children have small stomachs, a diet too high in bulk/fiber can lead to early satiety before they meet their high caloric needs for growth, potentially leading to growth faltering."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "To combat sarcopenia in geriatric populations (Lesson 8), what is the recommended daily protein intake range for active seniors on a plant-based diet?",
            "options": ["0.6 g/kg body weight", "0.8 g/kg body weight", "1.2 - 1.5 g/kg body weight", "2.5 - 3.0 g/kg body weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Geriatric clients require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5 g/kg) than younger adults to overcome 'anabolic resistance' and maintain muscle mass."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Based on the Esselstyn and Ornish case studies, what is the primary mechanism by which a <10% fat WFPB diet reverses Coronary Artery Disease?",
            "options": ["Increasing systemic inflammation", "Restoring endothelial function and nitric oxide bioavailability", "Increasing LDL cholesterol levels", "Reducing the diversity of the gut microbiome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The reversal of heart disease is largely attributed to the restoration of the endothelium's ability to produce nitric oxide, which dilates vessels and prevents plaque formation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Which specific dietary component has been linked to a 53% reduction in Alzheimer's risk in high-adherence MIND diet studies (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": ["Saturated fat from coconut", "High-fructose corn syrup", "Berries and leafy greens (Anthocyanins/Flavonols)", "Isolated soy protein isolates"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The high intake of berries (anthocyanins) and leafy greens (flavonols) in the MIND/WFPB pattern is the strongest predictor of cognitive longevity and Alzheimer's risk reduction."
