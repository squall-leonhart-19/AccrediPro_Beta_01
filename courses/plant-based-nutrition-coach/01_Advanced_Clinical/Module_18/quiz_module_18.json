            "question": "In the P.L.A.N.T. Method™ framework, the 'N' refers to 'Nutrient Density & Bioavailability.' Which concept is central to optimizing this pillar in a clinical protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing caloric intake to ensure micronutrient sufficiency",
                "Utilizing culinary techniques like fermentation and sprouting to reduce antinutrients",
                "Exclusively using raw foods to preserve enzymatic activity",
                "Prioritizing isolated supplements over whole-food sources"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The P.L.A.N.T. Method™ emphasizes that nutrient density is not just about what is eaten, but what is absorbed. Fermentation, soaking, and sprouting are key strategies to reduce phytates and oxalates, thereby increasing the bioavailability of minerals like iron and zinc."

            "question": "When analyzing advanced biomarkers for a long-term plant-based client, a serum Homocysteine level of 14 μmol/L is detected despite normal serum B12 levels. What is the most likely next step in nutritional correction?",
            "options": [
                "Decrease folate intake to prevent methyl-trap",
                "Test Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) and assess for B6 or riboflavin deficiencies",
                "Discontinue all supplementation as B12 is within range",
                "Increase dietary saturated fat to support methylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serum B12 can be falsely elevated by analogues; MMA is a more sensitive marker of functional B12 deficiency. Furthermore, homocysteine metabolism requires B6, Folate, and B2 (riboflavin) as cofactors in the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways."

            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Nutrigenomics. Which plant-derived compound is cited as a potent 'epigenetic modulator' capable of activating the Nrf2 pathway and enhancing Phase II detoxification?",
            "options": [
                "Lycopene from cooked tomatoes",
                "Sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables",
                "Resveratrol from grape skins",
                "Curcumin from turmeric"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a potent inducer of Nrf2, which regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation."

            "question": "In the context of Metabolic Flexibility (Lesson 4), a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70 during a fasted, resting state indicates which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The body is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates",
                "The body is in a state of anaerobic glycolysis",
                "The body is primarily oxidizing fatty acids",
                "The body is experiencing metabolic inflexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that 100% of fuel is being derived from fat oxidation. Metabolic flexibility is the ability to shift between 0.70 (fasted/fat) and 1.0 (fed/carbohydrate) efficiently."

            "question": "According to Behavioral Synthesis (Lesson 5), why is 'Identity-Based Habit Change' more effective than 'Outcome-Based Change' for long-term plant-based adherence?",
            "options": [
                "It focuses on the specific weight loss goal rather than the person",
                "It shifts the focus from 'what I want to achieve' to 'who I wish to become'",
                "It relies on willpower rather than environmental cues",
                "It ignores the psychological aspects of eating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based change, as discussed in the behavioral synthesis of the course, focuses on the internal belief system. When a client views themselves as 'a person who nourishes their body with plants,' the behavior becomes a reflection of their identity rather than a chore."

            "question": "A coach is working with a client who has Type 2 Diabetes and is taking insulin. According to Lesson 6 on Clinical Integration, what is the mandatory protocol for the coach?",
            "options": [
                "Independently adjust the client's insulin dosage based on their carbohydrate intake",
                "Advise the client to stop their medication once they start the plant-based diet",
                "Establish a multidisciplinary collaboration and refer the client to their physician for medication management",
                "Ignore the medication and focus only on the macronutrient ratios"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must operate within their scope of practice. Because a whole-food, plant-based diet can rapidly increase insulin sensitivity, medication adjustments must be managed by a licensed medical professional to prevent hypoglycemia."

            "question": "The 'Planetary Health Diet' (EAT-Lancet Commission) discussed in Lesson 7 suggests that global consumption of red meat and sugar must be reduced by what percentage to stay within planetary boundaries by 2050?",
            "options": [
                "Over 50%",
                "Exactly 10%",

                "No reduction is needed if regenerative farming is used"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The EAT-Lancet Commission report suggests that a >50% reduction in global consumption of unhealthy foods, such as red meat and sugar, is required to maintain the Earth's ecosystem stability."

            "question": "When designing a 'Master Blueprint' (Lesson 8) for a client with multiple health issues, what is the recommended 'Triage' priority?",
            "options": [
                "Aesthetic goals (weight loss) first, then health",
                "Digestion and Gut Health (Absorption) first, then specific metabolic corrections",
                "Advanced supplementation first to see quick results",
                "Intense exercise protocols before dietary changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Master Blueprint methodology, gut health and digestion are prioritized because if a client cannot absorb nutrients or is experiencing systemic inflammation from the gut, other metabolic interventions will be less effective."

            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the module suggests that plant-based fuel partitioning can improve insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) by an average of what percentage in sedentary adults?",

                "It has no effect on insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The synthesis of metabolic data in the course indicates that switching to a high-fiber, low-saturated fat plant-based diet typically yields a 15-25% improvement in HOMA-IR scores within 12 weeks."

            "id": "q18_10",
            "question": "The American Gut Project data mentioned in Lesson 1 suggests that individuals who consume more than ___ different types of plants per week have significantly higher microbial diversity than those who consume fewer than 10.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The American Gut Project found that the number of different plant species in the diet was the strongest predictor of microbial diversity, with the '30+ plants per week' group showing the best outcomes."
