            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a highly sensitive functional marker; elevated levels indicate a cellular B12 deficiency even when serum levels appear borderline normal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. 0.85 represents a balanced 'mixed' fuel utilization."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identity-based habits focus on the internal belief system. When a client identifies as a 'healthy person' or 'plant-based eater,' their behaviors align more naturally and sustainably."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never adjust medication; the professional protocol is to document progress and facilitate a conversation between the client and their doctor."

            "options": [
                "Because gut health is easier to fix than performance.",
                "To ensure the efficient absorption of nutrients and ergogenic aids required for performance.",
                "Because performance supplements damage the gut.",
                "There is no specific reason; the order is interchangeable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrient bioavailability is the foundation of performance. If the gut is compromised, the client cannot effectively utilize the high-quality fuel or supplements provided in later phases."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T variant impairs the conversion of folate; increasing natural methyl-folate from greens and B2 (a cofactor) helps lower homocysteine levels."

                "Fiber increases the speed of gastric emptying.",
                "Fermentation of fiber into Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate improves insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation.",
                "Fiber binds to carbohydrates and prevents them from ever being absorbed.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs produced by gut bacteria act as signaling molecules that improve mitochondrial function, insulin sensitivity, and the body's ability to switch between fuel sources."
