                "Non-human animals, including all mammals, birds, and many other creatures, possess the neuroanatomical substrates that generate consciousness.",

                "Consciousness in animals is a philosophical construct that cannot be scientifically proven through neuroanatomy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Declaration, signed by leading neuroscientists, stated that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors."

            "options": [
                "Food security focuses on the nutritional value of food, while sovereignty focuses only on calories.",
                "Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems.",
                "Food security is a political movement, whereas food sovereignty is a purely economic metric used by the World Bank.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Precision fermentation uses 'cell factories' (microbes) to produce specific proteins or fats that are identical to animal-derived versions, offering a middle ground between plant-based and cultivated meat."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches are not qualified to diagnose or treat eating disorders. When a client shows signs of disordered eating, the ethical and legal requirement is to refer them to licensed healthcare providers."

                "It measures the speed at which animals are slaughtered.",
                "It represents the efficiency with which an animal converts feed into body mass; high FCRs (like beef at 6:1 to 10:1) suggest significant caloric loss in the food system.",
