            "question": "When assessing Vitamin B12 status in a long-term vegan client, which biomarker is considered the most sensitive indicator of functional deficiency, even when serum B12 levels appear within the 'normal' low-end range?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Cobalamin",
                "Methylmalonic Acid (MMA)",
                "Hemoglobin A1c",
                "Serum Ferritin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) is a functional biomarker that rises when B12 levels are insufficient for cellular processes. It is more sensitive and specific than serum B12, which can be falsely elevated by inactive B12 analogues."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In the context of Microbiome Assessment, a 'Shannon Diversity Index' score is used to measure which specific metric?",
            "options": [
                "The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes",
                "The total concentration of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)",
                "The richness and evenness of microbial species within a sample",
                "The rate of colonic transit time"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Shannon Diversity Index is a mathematical measure of alpha-diversity, accounting for both the number of species present (richness) and how evenly they are distributed (evenness) in the gut microbiome."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to the scoring criteria for the Healthy Plant-Based Diet Index (hPDI), which of the following foods would receive a 'positive' score for dietary quality?",
            "options": [
                "Fruit juices",
                "Refined grains",
                "Potatoes/French fries",
                "Whole grains and legumes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The hPDI distinguishes between healthy and unhealthy plant foods. Whole grains, legumes, nuts, and whole fruits receive positive scores, while refined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and potatoes receive inverse (negative) scores."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A client's HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score is calculated at 3.2. How should a coach interpret this result regarding the client's metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal insulin sensitivity",
                "Early stages of insulin resistance",
                "Severe clinical Type 1 Diabetes",
                "Normal range for a plant-based athlete"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and scores above 2.9 generally indicate significant insulin resistance. Optimal levels are typically below 1.0."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "If a plant-based client presents with an elevated Homocysteine level (e.g., >15 μmol/L) but has adequate Folate intake, which nutritional deficiency should be investigated first?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Vitamin B12",

                "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 is a necessary cofactor for the conversion of homocysteine back to methionine. High homocysteine in the presence of adequate folate is a classic sign of B12 deficiency in plant-based populations."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Which anthropometric metric is increasingly preferred over BMI for plant-based practitioners because it better accounts for visceral adiposity and 'TOFI' (Thin on the Outside, Fat on the Inside) phenotypes?",
            "options": [
                "Waist-to-Height Ratio (WtHR)",
                "Total Body Weight",
                "Mid-upper arm circumference",
                "Chest-to-Waist Ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Waist-to-Height Ratio (WtHR) is a superior predictor of cardiometabolic risk. A ratio of <0.5 is generally considered healthy, regardless of total body weight or BMI."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "During a Biopsychosocial screening, a coach uses the 'Adherence Determinants Questionnaire'. What is the primary goal of this tool?",
            "options": [
                "To calculate exact caloric requirements",
                "To identify psychological and social barriers to maintaining dietary changes",
                "To measure the antioxidant capacity of the blood",
                "To determine the client's genetic predisposition to obesity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The biopsychosocial approach looks at the 'whole person.' Adherence tools identify social support, stress, and environmental factors that influence a client's ability to stick to a plant-based protocol."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "An Omega-3 Index test result of 3.5% in a vegan client who does not supplement with algae oil would be categorized as:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal/Cardioprotective",
                "Intermediate",
                "High Risk/Suboptimal",
                "Toxic level"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Omega-3 Index below 4% is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease. Many plant-based individuals fall in this range if they rely solely on ALA conversion without EPA/DHA supplementation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "When assessing oxidative stress, which biomarker represents the 'damage' done to LDL cholesterol particles, often reduced significantly on a high-antioxidant WFPB diet?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c",
                "Oxidized LDL (oxLDL)",
                "Serum Albumin",
                "Creatinine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) is a potent marker of oxidative stress and a major driver of atherosclerosis. Plant-based diets, rich in phytonutrients, typically lower oxLDL levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client has a high 'Plant-Based Diet Index' score but a low 'Shannon Diversity Index' on their stool analysis. What does this likely suggest to the coach?",
            "options": [
                "The client is eating too much protein",
                "The client is eating a high-volume plant-based diet but lacks variety/diversity in plant species",
                "The client has a genetic inability to digest fiber",
                "The stool test was contaminated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a diet may be 'plant-based,' if the client eats the same 5-10 foods every day, their microbial diversity will remain low. High microbial diversity (Shannon Index) requires a wide variety of different plant fibers (e.g., 30+ types per week)."
