            "question": "When assessing Vitamin B12 status in a long-term vegan client, why is Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) preferred over standard serum B12 testing?",
            "options": [
                "Serum B12 is often falsely elevated by inactive B12 analogues found in seaweeds.",
                "MMA is a functional marker that rises only when cellular B12 is insufficient.",
                "Serum B12 has a very short half-life of only 24 hours.",
                "MMA measures the intake of B12 from the last 48 hours only."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MMA is considered the 'gold standard' functional marker because it only accumulates in the blood or urine when the body lacks sufficient B12 to convert it, whereas serum B12 can stay within 'normal' ranges even when tissues are depleted."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The hPDI distinguishes between healthy plant foods and 'unhealthy' plant foods. Refined grains, potatoes/fries, and fruit juices are negatively scored as they are associated with higher metabolic risk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is calculated using the formula: (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose) / 405 (using mg/dL) or / 22.5 (using mmol/L). It assesses the balance between hepatic glucose output and insulin secretion."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (such as Haghighatdoost et al.) show that switching to a plant-based diet typically reduces hs-CRP by approximately 25-35%, reflecting a significant decrease in systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) is a more sensitive predictor than BMI for identifying central adiposity, especially in individuals who fall within a 'normal' BMI range but have high internal visceral fat."

                "High, suggesting iron overload from fortified foods.",

                "Irrelevant, as iron status does not affect aerobic capacity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 25 ng/mL may be within the 'normal' lab range, plant-based athletes often require higher ferritin levels (typically >30 or >50 ng/mL depending on the sport) to ensure adequate oxygen transport and energy metabolism."
