            "question": "Which epigenetic clock is currently considered the 'gold standard' for predicting mortality (lifespan) because it incorporates surrogate markers like plasma proteins and smoking history?",
            "options": [
                "The Horvath Clock (1st Generation)",
                "The Hannum Clock (1st Generation)",
                "GrimAge (2nd Generation)",
                "DunedinPACE (3rd Generation)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 1st generation clocks measure chronological age, GrimAge is a 2nd generation clock trained on mortality and physiological markers, making it significantly more predictive of actual lifespan and healthspan."

            "question": "The 'Longevity Microbiome' is characterized by high levels of Akkermansia muciniphila. What is the primary mechanism by which this bacterium supports gut barrier integrity?",
            "options": [
                "By producing high amounts of Vitamin K2 in the colon",
                "By stimulating the production and thickening of the mucin layer",
                "By directly neutralizing lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",
                "By outcompeting Lactobacillus strains for fiber"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila lives in and 'grazes' on the mucus layer, which paradoxically stimulates goblet cells to produce more mucus, resulting in a thicker, more robust gut barrier that prevents systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study of 122,007 patients found that being in the 'Elite' aerobic fitness category was associated with a 5-fold (80%+) reduction in mortality risk compared to the lowest performers, a greater benefit than being a non-smoker."

                "They prevent the absorption of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senescent cells remain metabolically active and secrete the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which includes pro-inflammatory cytokines that damage neighboring healthy cells and drive systemic 'inflammaging'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During deep sleep, the brain's interstitial space increases by up to 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic waste products like beta-amyloid, which are linked to neurodegeneration."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A biological age significantly higher than chronological age indicates accelerated aging, usually driven by 'inflammaging' or metabolic dysfunction. Addressing the root causes of systemic inflammation is the priority."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormesis follows a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve where a low dose of stress (like cold, heat, or exercise) triggers protective cellular responses, while too much causes damage."
