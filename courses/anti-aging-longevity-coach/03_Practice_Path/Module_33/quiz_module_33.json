            "question": "A Longevity Coach suggests a client start a 500mg daily regimen of Metformin for its AMPK-activating properties. Which legal boundary has been primarily violated?",
            "options": [
                "The coach is providing nutritional counseling within their scope.",
                "The coach is practicing medicine without a license by recommending a prescription drug.",
                "The coach is protected under the 'Educational Information' exemption.",
                "The coach is compliant as long as they do not sell the medication themselves."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recommending, prescribing, or dosing scheduled medications (like Metformin) is a strictly medical act. Coaches must limit recommendations to lifestyle, nutrition, and non-prescriptive interventions to avoid 'Practicing Medicine Without a License' (PMWAL)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires 'competent and reliable scientific evidence,' which for health claims generally means randomized, controlled human clinical trials (RCTs) conducted by qualified experts."
