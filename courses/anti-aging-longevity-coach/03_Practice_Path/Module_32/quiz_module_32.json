            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 3:1 ratio is the industry gold standard for premium health services, ensuring that the value generated from a client is triple the cost spent to acquire them, allowing for reinvestment and profit."

            "question": "According to the Authority Marketing principles in L4, what is the 'Authority Gap' and how is it bridged?",
            "options": ["The price difference between competitors; bridged by discounts", "The distance between a lead and a sale; bridged by email marketing", "The perceived expertise vs. actual expertise; bridged by peer-reviewed publications and white papers", "The time it takes to see results; bridged by supplements"],

            "question": "When building a 'Longevity Tech Stack' (L5), what is the primary purpose of an API-first integration strategy?",
            "options": ["To reduce the cost of software subscriptions", "To ensure seamless data flow between wearables (e.g., Oura) and the client CRM", "To prevent clients from seeing their own data", "To replace the need for a human coach"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An API-first strategy ensures that disparate tools (wearables, labs, CRMs) can communicate, preventing 'data silos' and providing a unified view of the client's longevity biomarkers."

            "id": "q32_6",
            "question": "In L6 (Financial Management), which metric is considered the most critical 'Leading Indicator' for a longevity practice's future profitability?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client Retention Rate is a leading indicator of profitability because the cost of retaining an existing longevity client is significantly lower than acquiring a new one (often 5-25x cheaper)."

            "id": "q32_7",

            "question": "During a Practice Audit (L8), a coach discovers that 40% of clients drop out after the initial biological age test. What does this 'leakage' typically indicate?",
            "options": ["The test is too expensive", "A failure in the 'Value Realization' phase of the onboarding process", "The clients are too healthy to need coaching", "The tech stack is outdated"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High churn immediately after testing suggests that the practitioner is not effectively translating complex data into an actionable, high-value plan that the client understands."

            "options": ["Digital products have lower gross margins", "Digital products have higher scalability but require higher upfront CAC", "1-on-1 coaching has higher net profit per hour", "Both have identical margin profiles"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital products offer near-infinite scalability and high gross margins once built, but they typically require a higher initial Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) through paid advertising compared to referral-based 1-on-1 coaching."
