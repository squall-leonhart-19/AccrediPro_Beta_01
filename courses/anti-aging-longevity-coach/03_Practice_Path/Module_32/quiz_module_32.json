                "Profitability will increase because new clients pay higher onboarding fees.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In high-ticket longevity coaching, the cost of acquisition is high. High churn rates prevent the practice from recouping the CAC and benefiting from the high-margin recurring phases of the protocol."
