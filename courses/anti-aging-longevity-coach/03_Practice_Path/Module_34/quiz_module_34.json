            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training is the 'sweet spot' for mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic flexibility. In a group setting, the 'talk test' is a practical way to ensure participants stay in this aerobic zone."

            "question": "A coach is running a 30-day longevity challenge. One participant's wearable data shows a sudden, sustained drop in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and an increase in Resting Heart Rate (RHR). What is the appropriate group-facilitator response?",
            "options": [
                "Publicly congratulate them on working so hard",
                "Ignore it, as individual data shouldn't be monitored in group programs",

                "Tell the entire group to follow this participant's lead and increase their intensity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A drop in HRV and rise in RHR are classic signs of sympathetic dominance or overtraining. A professional coach must monitor these 'red flags' and intervene privately to ensure participant safety and program efficacy."
