            "question": "According to the 'Blue Ocean' strategy discussed in Lesson 1, how should a longevity professional differentiate their practice from traditional fitness or nutrition coaching?",
            "options": [
                "By competing solely on price to attract a larger volume of clients",
                "By focusing on 'General Wellness' rather than specific longevity biomarkers",
                "By creating a unique value proposition that combines biological data with high-touch behavioral modification",
                "By marketing exclusively through traditional local print media"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that a 'Blue Ocean' strategy involves making the competition irrelevant by offering a unique combination of data-driven insights (biomarkers) and intensive coaching that traditional mass-market fitness models cannot provide."

            "question": "When designing a high-ticket longevity program (L2), why is a 6-to-12-month duration recommended over a standard 4-week 'challenge'?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize the coach's hourly rate through administrative fees",
                "Because significant changes in biological age and epigenetic markers often require 180+ days of consistent intervention to manifest",
                "Because clients are more likely to pay upfront for shorter programs",
                "To reduce the amount of data tracking required per client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As noted in Lesson 2, longevity is a long-term play. High-ticket programs are structured for 6-12 months because physiological shifts in biomarkers like HbA1c, lipid profiles, and epigenetic clocks require sustained lifestyle changes to show measurable improvement."

            "options": [
                "'Our program focuses on optimizing metabolic health and cellular resilience.'",
                "'This protocol is designed to help you age more gracefully through lifestyle shifts.'",
                "'Our proprietary supplement stack is guaranteed to cure Type 2 Diabetes and reverse Alzheimer's.'",
                "'We use wearable data to inform personalized recovery and sleep strategies.'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 details that coaches must never use 'disease claims' such as 'cure,' 'treat,' or 'diagnose.' Claiming to cure specific medical conditions like Diabetes or Alzheimer's is a major legal violation for non-medical practitioners."

            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, 'Evidence-Based Marketing' suggests using the '80/20 Authority Rule.' What does this rule entail?",
            "options": [
                "Spending 80% of your budget on ads and 20% on content creation",
                "Providing 80% educational/value-based content and 20% direct promotional offers",
                "Focusing on the 80% of clients who provide 20% of your revenue",
                "Using 80-year-old studies to back up 20-year-old theories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 Authority Rule builds trust by positioning the coach as an expert. By providing valuable, science-backed education 80% of the time, the 20% of promotional content becomes significantly more effective."

            "question": "What is the primary function of a 'Longevity Tech Stack' (L5) in a scalable practice?",
            "options": [
                "To replace the coach entirely with Artificial Intelligence",
                "To automate the collection and visualization of client data from wearables like Oura, Whoop, or CGM devices",
                "To increase the complexity of the client experience to justify higher prices",
                "To focus exclusively on social media management and lead generation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 highlights that a 'Tech Stack' should streamline data aggregation. Using platforms that sync wearable data allows the coach to provide 'proactive' rather than 'reactive' coaching without manually checking dozens of apps."

            "question": "A longevity coach partners with a local Concierge Medicine clinic. According to Lesson 6, what is the most effective way to structure this 'Referral Ecosystem'?",
            "options": [
                "Asking the doctor for a 50% commission on every patient referred",
                "Providing a 'co-management' model where the coach handles lifestyle implementation that the doctor doesn't have time for",
                "Demanding that the doctor stop seeing all other health coaches",
                "Sending the doctor cold emails daily until they respond"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strategic partnerships thrive on mutual benefit. Doctors often have the 'what' (diagnosis/prescription) but lack the time for the 'how' (daily lifestyle coaching). Positioning the coach as the implementation arm creates a seamless referral loop."

            "options": [
                "By removing all human interaction and using only pre-recorded videos",
                "By combining a digital curriculum for education with small-group 'Mastermind' style coaching calls",
                "By doubling the price of 1-on-1 coaching every month",
                "By hiring unqualified assistants to handle all client communication"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 explains that the Hybrid Model allows the coach to deliver the same educational foundation to many people at once via digital modules, while using group calls to provide the 'premium' feel and community support."

            "id": "q30_8",
            "question": "A practice has a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $400 and an average Client Lifetime Value (LTV) of $6,000. Based on Lesson 8, what does this 15:1 ratio suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The practice is overspending on marketing and will soon fail",
                "The practice is highly profitable and has significant room to increase marketing spend for growth",
                "The LTV is too low for a longevity practice",
                "The coach should stop all marketing and focus only on referrals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In practice analytics (L8), an LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 is considered the minimum for health businesses. A 15:1 ratio is exceptional, indicating the practice is very efficient and can afford to spend more to acquire more clients."

            "id": "q30_9",
            "question": "According to the 'Scope of Practice' guidelines in Lesson 3, what must a coach do if a client's blood work shows a critically high fasting glucose level?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe a high dose of Metformin immediately",
                "Ignore the result as it is outside the coach's niche",
                "Refer the client to their primary care physician for medical evaluation and diagnosis",
                "Tell the client they definitely have Type 2 Diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longevity coaches are educators, not doctors. If a biomarker indicates a potential medical pathology, the ethical and legal requirement is to refer the client to a licensed medical professional."

            "id": "q30_10",
            "question": "Which pricing strategy is most effective for a 'Premium' longevity practice aiming for long-term sustainability (L2)?",

                "Hourly billing to ensure every minute is paid for",
                "Value-based packaging that focuses on the 'ROI of Health' and specific longevity outcomes",
                "The 'Freemium' model where all coaching is free and you only sell supplements",
                "Matching the lowest price of any local personal trainer"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing (L2) decouples the coach's time from their income. By selling an outcome (e.g., '10-year increase in healthspan') rather than an hour of time, the practitioner can charge premium rates that reflect the life-changing nature of the work."
