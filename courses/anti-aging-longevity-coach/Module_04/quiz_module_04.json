            "question": "Research into the 'Epigenetic Clock' suggests that while genetics play a role, what percentage of human longevity is estimated to be determined by lifestyle and environmental factors?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 20-30%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Exactly 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple longitudinal studies, including those on identical twins, suggest that only about 20-30% of lifespan is heritable, leaving 70-80% to be determined by epigenetic modifications driven by lifestyle and environment."

            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) acts as the body's master clock. Which specific wavelength of light is most potent at suppressing melatonin production via melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells?",
            "options": [
                "Infrared light (700nm - 1mm)",
                "Green light (495–570 nm)",
                "Blue light (450–485 nm)",
                "Ultraviolet light (100–400 nm)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blue light in the 450-485 nm range is the primary 'Zeitgeber' that signals the SCN to suppress melatonin, making evening exposure a significant disruptor of circadian rhythms and longevity signaling."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The Glymphatic system is a waste-clearance pathway in the brain that becomes significantly more active during sleep. During which phase of sleep is this system most efficient at removing beta-amyloid plaques?",
            "options": [
                "REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep",
                "Stage 1 Light Sleep",
                "Stage 2 Light Sleep",
                "Stage 3 NREM (Slow-Wave Sleep)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "During Stage 3 NREM (Deep/Slow-Wave Sleep), the interstitial space in the brain increases by up to 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out metabolic waste and neurotoxic proteins like beta-amyloid."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis leads to sustained high levels of cortisol. What is the observed effect of chronic cortisol exposure on telomerase activity?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly downregulates telomerase, accelerating telomere shortening.",
                "It upregulates telomerase to compensate for oxidative stress.",
                "It has no measurable effect on telomerase activity.",
                "It stabilizes telomeres but prevents cellular division."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol exposure is associated with lower telomerase activity. Without sufficient telomerase to repair the ends of chromosomes, cells reach the Hayflick limit faster, leading to premature cellular senescence."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Hormetic stress, such as thermal therapy, triggers the production of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs). What is the primary function of HSP70 in the context of longevity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HSP70 acts as a molecular chaperone, preventing protein aggregation and ensuring that proteins maintain their correct 3D conformation, which is essential for preventing age-related proteotoxicity."

                "95% reduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study by Laukkanen et al. (2015) demonstrated a 63% lower risk of sudden cardiac death in high-frequency sauna users, highlighting the powerful cardiovascular benefits of hormetic heat stress."

            "options": [
                "By increasing the pH of the mitochondrial matrix",
                "By inducing oxidative stress and uncoupling the electron transport chain",

                "By converting mitochondria into lysosomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These toxins interfere with the electron transport chain and increase the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), leading to mitochondrial DNA damage and reduced bioenergetic efficiency."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the context of breathwork and autonomic regulation, how does a prolonged exhalation (longer than the inhalation) influence the heart rate?",
            "options": [
                "It increases heart rate via the sympathetic nervous system.",
                "It has no effect on heart rate.",
                "It triggers the baroreceptor reflex to increase blood pressure.",
                "It stimulates the Vagus nerve to slow the heart rate (Parasympathetic activation)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Exhalation is linked to the parasympathetic nervous system. By extending the exhale, we stimulate the Vagus nerve, which releases acetylcholine to slow the heart rate and lower the stress response."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "When designing a 'Longevity Environment' using habit stacking, what is the most effective way to ensure a new habit (like taking a supplement) becomes permanent?",
            "options": [
                "Perform the new habit at a completely random time each day.",
                "Anchor the new habit immediately following an existing, automatic habit.",
                "Rely on willpower and intense motivation.",
                "Wait until the end of the day to perform all new habits at once."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking utilizes the neural pathways already established by 'anchor' habits. By placing a new behavior immediately after an old one, you reduce the cognitive load required to initiate the action."

            "question": "A client complains of 'brain fog' and midday fatigue. They work in a windowless office and exercise late at night under bright LED lights. Which intervention addresses the root cause of their mitochondrial and circadian dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing caffeine intake in the afternoon.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This client is suffering from circadian misalignment. Morning sunlight resets the master clock, while blocking blue light in the evening prevents the suppression of natural melatonin, improving sleep architecture and mitochondrial repair."
