            "question": "Which epigenetic clock is widely considered the most accurate predictor of mortality and 'biological' healthspan, rather than just chronological age?",
            "options": [
                "The original Horvath Multi-tissue Clock",
                "The Hannum Clock",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormesis is characterized by a biphasic response where a low-intensity stressor triggers adaptive, protective mechanisms that improve cellular resilience, while high doses cause damage."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aging muscles require a higher concentration of the amino acid leucine (the 'trigger' for MPS) to overcome anabolic resistance; research suggests 2.5g to 3g per meal is the effective threshold for older adults."
