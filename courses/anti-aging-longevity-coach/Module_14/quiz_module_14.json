            "question": "L3: Mitochondrial Bioenergetics highlights PGC-1α as a 'master regulator.' What is the primary biological process stimulated by the activation of PGC-1α?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) is the primary driver of mitochondrial biogenesis, the process by which cells increase mitochondrial mass."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In L4: Exercise as Medicine, a landmark 2018 study (Mandsager et al.) found that 'Elite' aerobic fitness (VO2 Max) was associated with what reduction in all-cause mortality compared to the 'Low' fitness group?",
            "options": ["20% reduction", "45% reduction", "60% reduction", "80% reduction"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The study found that elite fitness was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.20, representing an 80% reduction in all-cause mortality risk compared to the lowest performing group."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'SASP' phenomenon associated with senescent cells discussed in L5?",
            "options": ["A protocol for rapid mitochondrial repair", "The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors by 'zombie' cells", "The process of programmed cell death (apoptosis)", "A specific type of antioxidant found in polyphenols"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) is the harmful 'cocktail' of inflammatory signals that senescent cells release, which can damage neighboring healthy cells."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "According to the Laukkanen et al. (2015) study on Finnish men discussed in L6, what frequency of sauna use was associated with the lowest risk of fatal cardiovascular disease?",
            "options": ["1 time per week", "2-3 times per week", "4-7 times per week", "Sauna use had no effect"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated a dose-response relationship, where men using the sauna 4-7 times per week had a 50% lower risk of fatal CVD compared to those using it once weekly."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "In L7: Precision Nutrition, what is the recommended 'Time in Range' (70–140 mg/dL) for a longevity-focused client using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)?",
            "options": [">50%", ">75%", ">85%", ">95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "For optimal longevity and minimization of glycation, practitioners aim for a 'Time in Range' of >95%, significantly higher than the standard clinical recommendation for diabetics."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client presents with low energy and poor recovery. Based on L3, which metabolite derived from ellagitannins (found in pomegranates) has been shown to induce mitophagy and improve muscle function?",
            "options": ["Resveratrol", "Urolithin A", "Quercetin", "Fisetin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A is a postbiotic metabolite that triggers mitophagy (the clearing of damaged mitochondria) and has shown clinical promise in improving muscle endurance."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Based on the hormetic protocols in L6, why should a client interested in maximal muscle hypertrophy avoid Cold Water Immersion (CWI) immediately after a resistance training session?",
            "options": ["It increases cortisol too much", "It blunts the p70S6K signaling pathway and satellite cell activation", "It causes excessive mitochondrial fission", "It leads to dangerous levels of norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CWI immediately post-lifting reduces the inflammatory signaling required for muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy; it is recommended to wait at least 4-6 hours."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "When designing an Integrated Protocol (L8), which sequence of interventions is generally prioritized for a foundational longevity plan?",
            "options": ["Supplements > Exercise > Sleep > Nutrition", "Nutrition > Supplements > Hormesis > Exercise", "Sleep/Circadian Alignment > Nutrition > Exercise > Targeted Supplements", "Senolytics > VO2 Max Training > Microbiome > Sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Master Longevity Plan prioritizes foundational pillars (Sleep, Nutrition, Exercise) before layering on more advanced or 'biohack' interventions like targeted supplementation or senolytics."
