            "question": "According to the Longevity Supplement Hierarchy, which of the following must be optimized before introducing 'Tier 3' longevity-specific molecules like Senolytics?",
            "options": [
                "Genetic testing and epigenetic age clocks",
                "Foundational lifestyle factors (Sleep, Nutrition, Movement)",
                "High-dose NAD+ intravenous therapy",
                "Advanced wearable data integration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Longevity Supplement Hierarchy places lifestyle (Sleep, Nutrition, Movement) at the foundation. Supplements cannot 'out-biohack' a poor lifestyle, and Tier 3 interventions are only recommended once the foundation is stable."

            "question": "In the context of NAD+ precursors, what is the primary distinction regarding the Slc12a8 transporter mentioned in Lesson 2?",
            "options": [
                "It is the primary transporter for Resveratrol into the nucleus",
                "It allows Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) to bypass the liver",
                "It is a specific transporter that allows NMN to enter cells directly in the small intestine",
                "It converts NAD+ into NADH during the Krebs cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research has identified Slc12a8 as a specific transporter for Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), allowing it to be absorbed directly into cells, particularly in the gut, which is a key differentiator from other precursors."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "What is the 'Hit and Run' protocol typically recommended for Senolytic supplements like Fisetin or Quercetin?",
            "options": [
                "Taking a low dose every day for 365 days a year",
                "Taking a high dose for 2-3 consecutive days, followed by a long break (e.g., one month)",
                "Taking the supplement only immediately after a high-intensity workout",
                "Using the supplement topically rather than through oral ingestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senolytics are designed to clear 'zombie' (senescent) cells. Because these cells take time to accumulate, a pulsatile 'hit and run' dosing strategy (high dose briefly, then a break) is used to clear cells without causing chronic suppression of necessary biological processes."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Berberine is often called a 'Metabolic Mimetic.' What is its primary mechanism of action for managing blood glucose?",
            "options": [
                "Directly injecting insulin into the bloodstream",
                "Activating the AMPK pathway, similar to the effects of exercise",
                "Blocking the absorption of all dietary fats in the small intestine",
                "Increasing the production of cortisol to mobilize stored sugars"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine activates Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), often called the 'metabolic master switch,' which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, mimicking some effects of exercise and caloric restriction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A is one of the few compounds shown to trigger mitophagy—the selective recycling of old, dysfunctional mitochondria into new, healthy ones—which is critical for maintaining muscle tissue as we age."

            "question": "The 20-year Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease study (n=2,315) found that men who used a sauna 4-7 times per week had what reduction in Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) compared to those using it once a week?",

                "95% reduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study by Laukkanen et al. (2015) demonstrated a 63% reduction in SCD and a 40% reduction in all-cause mortality for those using the sauna 4-7 times per week."

            "options": [
                "11 minutes total per week, spread across multiple sessions",
                "60 minutes total per week in a single session",

                "Cold exposure is only effective if done daily for 30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Dr. Susanna Søberg's research suggests that just 11 minutes of deliberate cold exposure per week (cumulative) is sufficient to increase Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) activity and improve metabolic rate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red and near-infrared light (660nm-850nm) are absorbed by Cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria, which leads to increased ATP (energy) production and reduced oxidative stress."

            "question": "When analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data from a wearable, a significant 'drop' from the client's baseline most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "The client is in a state of high recovery and readiness",
                "The client's parasympathetic nervous system is dominant",
                "The client is under physiological stress, overtraining, or potential illness",
                "The wearable device is broken and needs recalibration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A decrease in HRV indicates a dominant sympathetic (fight or flight) response and a lack of variability between heartbeats, signaling that the body is under stress and may need more recovery."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "A client is using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and notices a large glucose spike after a high-carb meal. Which 'biohack' from Lesson 4 is most effective for immediately blunting this postprandial spike?",
            "options": [
                "Taking a 10-minute walk immediately after the meal",
                "Taking a nap to allow the body to digest",
                "Drinking 2 liters of ice water",
                "Using a red light therapy panel on the abdomen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Postprandial (after-meal) movement, such as a 10-minute walk, utilizes the GLUT4 transporter to move glucose into muscle cells without requiring extra insulin, effectively blunting the glucose spike."
