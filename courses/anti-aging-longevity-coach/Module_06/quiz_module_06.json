            "question": "According to the Longevity Supplement Hierarchy, which category should be addressed AFTER foundational nutrient gaps but BEFORE experimental longevity compounds?",
            "options": [
                "Senolytics and Sirtuin activators",
                "Metabolic Optimizers (e.g., Berberine, Magnesium)",
                "NAD+ Precursors (NMN/NR)",
                "Mitochondrial Mimetics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hierarchy moves from Foundation (Multivitamins/Omega-3s) to Metabolic Support (Magnesium/Berberine), then to Targeted Longevity (NAD+/Senolytics). Addressing metabolic health is critical before adding high-level longevity compounds."

            "question": "A 2023 clinical trial on NMN supplementation (n=80) demonstrated that which dosage was most effective at increasing blood NAD+ levels and improving walking distance?",
            "options": [
                "250 mg per day",
                "600 mg per day",
                "900 mg per day",
                "1,200 mg per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2023 study by Yi et al. found that while 300mg was effective, the 600mg and 900mg doses showed significantly higher efficacy, with 900mg often representing the upper threshold for peak NAD+ saturation in clinical settings."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "What is the primary characteristic of the 'Hit and Run' protocol used in Senolytic therapy (e.g., Dasatinib + Quercetin)?",
            "options": [
                "Taking the supplements only immediately after a high-carb meal",
                "Daily low-dose administration to maintain steady blood levels",
                "Intermittent high-dose administration (e.g., 2 days every month)",
                "Taking the supplements only during a 24-hour fast"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senolytics target 'zombie' cells. Because these cells take weeks to accumulate, daily dosing is unnecessary and potentially toxic; instead, an intermittent 'hit and run' approach is used to clear the burden."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Berberine is often called 'natural Metformin.' What is its primary molecular mechanism for improving glucose disposal?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine activates AMPK, the body's 'metabolic master switch,' which increases glucose uptake in muscles and improves insulin sensitivity, similar to the pharmaceutical Metformin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A, a metabolite of ellagitannins found in pomegranates, is one of the few known compounds that can effectively trigger mitophagy, ensuring a healthy pool of functional mitochondria."

            "question": "According to the 20-year Finnish sauna study (Laukkanen et al.), what frequency of sauna use was associated with a 50% reduction in fatal cardiovascular disease events?",
            "options": [
                "1 time per week",
                "2-3 times per week",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found a dose-response relationship; participants using the sauna 4-7 times per week had significantly lower rates of CVD mortality compared to those using it once per week."

            "question": "When interpreting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data from a wearable device, a significant, sudden drop in the client's baseline HRV most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Improved cardiovascular fitness",
                "The body is in a state of high recovery and readiness",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A drop in HRV indicates a shift toward Sympathetic (fight or flight) dominance, suggesting the body is struggling to recover from stress, illness, or excessive physical exertion."

            "question": "Based on the concept of 'hormetic interference,' why might a coach advise a client NOT to take high-dose Vitamin C and E immediately after resistance training?",
            "options": [
                "It causes extreme nausea when mixed with protein",
                "Antioxidants can blunt the ROS signaling required for muscle hypertrophy and adaptation",

                "Vitamin C neutralizes the effects of creatine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exercise-induced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) act as signaling molecules for muscle growth. High-dose antioxidants can 'mop up' these signals, potentially reducing the training benefits (hormetic adaptation)."

            "question": "A client is using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and notices a large glucose spike (160 mg/dL) after a meal, followed by a 'crash' (70 mg/dL). Which biohack is most effective at flattening this curve if performed immediately after eating?",
            "options": [
                "A 5-minute cold plunge",
                "Taking a high dose of NAD+ precursors",

                "Using a red light therapy panel on the abdomen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-prandial movement (walking) utilizes the GLUT-4 translocation mechanism to pull glucose into the muscles without requiring excess insulin, effectively flattening the glucose spike and preventing the subsequent crash."
