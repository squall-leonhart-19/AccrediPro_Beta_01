            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'Longevity Gap' discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "The difference between life expectancy in developed vs. developing nations",
                "The numerical difference between an individual's chronological age and their calculated biological age",
                "The time delay between the onset of chronic disease and the actual time of death",
                "The genetic variance between siblings regarding lifespan potential"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Longevity Gap refers to the discrepancy between chronological age (years lived) and biological age (the physiological state of the body). A positive gap suggests accelerated aging."

            "question": "According to research on epigenetic clocks, why is 'GrimAge' considered particularly significant in a clinical longevity setting?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only clock that measures telomere length directly",
                "It is the cheapest clock to administer in a primary care setting",
                "It is highly predictive of mortality and time-to-death by incorporating DNA methylation of plasma proteins",
                "It focuses exclusively on liver enzymes and metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GrimAge is a 'second-generation' clock that outperforms earlier versions (like the original Horvath clock) because it was trained to predict mortality by factoring in methylation patterns associated with smoking and plasma proteins."

            "question": "A client presents with a Fasting Glucose of 95 mg/dL and a Fasting Insulin of 12 uIU/mL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and what does it indicate?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR 2.8; Indicates significant insulin resistance",
                "HOMA-IR 1.2; Indicates optimal metabolic health",
                "HOMA-IR 4.5; Indicates Type 2 Diabetes",
                "HOMA-IR 0.8; Indicates elite metabolic flexibility"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "95 x 12 / 405 = 2.81. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and above 2.9 indicates significant resistance. Optimal longevity targets are typically < 1.0."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In cardiovascular risk assessment, why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) considered a superior marker to LDL-C?",
            "options": [
                "ApoB measures the weight of the cholesterol, which is more important than particle count",
                "ApoB measures the total number of atherogenic particles, as each contains exactly one ApoB molecule",
                "ApoB is less expensive to test than a standard lipid panel",
                "ApoB levels do not fluctuate based on diet or exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB provides a direct measure of the total number of atherogenic particles (LDL, VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a)). Since each particle has one ApoB molecule, it is a more accurate predictor of plaque buildup than the total mass of cholesterol (LDL-C)."

                "High risk for cardiovascular events and systemic low-grade inflammation",
                "The client exercised too hard 20 minutes before the blood draw"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP levels between 3.0 and 10.0 mg/L are associated with high systemic inflammation and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Optimal longevity targets are usually < 1.0 mg/L."

            "question": "Which endocrine biomarker is often referred to as the 'adrenal age' marker because it peaks in the mid-20s and declines steadily by approximately 80-90% over a lifetime?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Free Testosterone",
                "DHEA-S",
                "Estradiol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is a pro-hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Its predictable decline makes it a primary biomarker for assessing 'adrenal age' and overall vitality."

            "question": "Based on the 2018 study by Mandsager et al., how does the mortality risk of individuals with 'Elite' VO2 Max compare to those in the 'Low' performance category?",
            "options": [
                "Elite performers have a 20% lower risk of death",
                "Elite performers have a 50% lower risk of death",
                "Elite performers have a 5-fold (500%) reduction in all-cause mortality risk",
                "There was no statistically significant difference between the categories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that elite aerobic fitness was associated with a 5-fold reduction in all-cause mortality compared to the lowest performers, emphasizing VO2 Max as one of the strongest predictors of longevity."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When assessing immune senescence, a CD4:CD8 ratio of less than 1.0 is generally interpreted as:",

                "An 'Immune Risk Profile' (IRP) associated with accelerated aging",

                "The ideal ratio for preventing autoimmune disorders"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A CD4:CD8 ratio below 1.0 is a hallmark of immune senescence (aging of the immune system) and is often associated with chronic viral load (like CMV) and increased mortality in the elderly."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key step in 'Integrating Data' to create a Longevity Roadmap as described in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "Focusing exclusively on the biomarker that is easiest to change",
                "Prioritizing 'Red Zone' biomarkers that fall outside of clinical or optimal ranges",
                "Ignoring blood markers if functional markers (like grip strength) are high",
                "Prescribing the same supplement stack to all clients regardless of data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The roadmap process involves identifying 'Red Zone' biomarkers (those furthest from optimal) and addressing them first, as they represent the greatest 'leaks' in the client's longevity profile."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "In the context of longevity coaching, why is it critical to measure IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)?",
            "options": [
                "Because higher levels always result in a longer lifespan",
                "Because it is the only way to measure daily caloric intake",
                "Because it follows a U-shaped risk curve where both very high and very low levels can negatively impact longevity",
                "Because it is the primary marker for bone density in post-menopausal women"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IGF-1 has a complex relationship with aging: very high levels are linked to increased cancer risk (pro-growth), while very low levels are linked to frailty and cognitive decline. Longevity coaching aims for a 'Goldilocks' zone."
