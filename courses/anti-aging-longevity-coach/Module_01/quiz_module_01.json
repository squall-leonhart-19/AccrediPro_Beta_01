            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "According to the 'Longevity Gap' concept discussed in Lesson 1, what percentage of the variance in human lifespan is estimated to be determined by genetics versus lifestyle/environment?",
            "options": ["50% Genetics, 50% Lifestyle", "10% Genetics, 90% Lifestyle", "25% Genetics, 75% Lifestyle", "80% Genetics, 20% Lifestyle"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extensive twin studies and longitudinal research suggest that approximately 25% of lifespan variance is genetic, while 75% is determined by modifiable lifestyle factors and environmental exposures."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which epigenetic clock is specifically recognized for its superior ability to predict mortality and 'time-to-death' by incorporating plasma proteins and smoking history into its algorithm?",
            "options": ["The Horvath Clock (Original)", "The Hannum Clock", "GrimAge", "PhenoAge"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the Horvath clock was pioneering, GrimAge is considered the 'gold standard' for predicting healthspan and mortality because it utilizes DNA methylation surrogates for plasma proteins and smoking pack-years."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a Fasting Glucose of 98 mg/dL and a Fasting Insulin of 15 uIU/mL. What is their HOMA-IR score, and how is it interpreted in a longevity context?",
            "options": ["HOMA-IR: 1.5 (Optimal)", "HOMA-IR: 3.6 (Significant Insulin Resistance)", "HOMA-IR: 0.8 (Excellent)", "HOMA-IR: 5.2 (Type 2 Diabetes)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is calculated as (Glucose x Insulin) / 405. Here, (98 x 15) / 405 = 3.63. In longevity medicine, a HOMA-IR > 2.0 indicates insulin resistance, even if glucose is within the 'normal' clinical range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In assessing cardiovascular risk for longevity, why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) considered a more precise biomarker than LDL-C?",
            "options": ["ApoB measures the total volume of cholesterol in the blood", "ApoB measures the size of the HDL particles only", "ApoB provides a direct count of all atherogenic particles, including LDL, VLDL, and IDL", "ApoB is less expensive to test than a standard lipid panel"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LDL-C measures the mass of cholesterol, which can be misleading. ApoB provides a 1:1 count of every potentially plaque-forming particle, offering a more accurate assessment of cumulative cardiovascular risk."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A client's blood work shows an hs-CRP level of 3.5 mg/L in the absence of acute injury or illness. What does this most likely indicate regarding their 'Inflammaging' status?",
            "options": ["Low risk; inflammation is negligible", "Average risk for their age group", "High systemic inflammation and increased risk for age-related chronic disease", "The test is invalid and must be repeated immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In longevity medicine, an hs-CRP < 1.0 mg/L is optimal. A level of 3.5 mg/L, when chronic, indicates high systemic inflammation, which accelerates cellular senescence and increases the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which endocrine biomarker serves as a primary 'adrenal clock' and typically declines by 80-90% between the ages of 25 and 75?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "DHEA-S", "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)", "Progesterone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEA-S (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) is a key precursor hormone that shows a linear and significant decline with age, making it a vital biomarker for assessing adrenal age and vitality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Research on VO2 Max and mortality (Mandsager et al., 2018) demonstrated that individuals in the 'Elite' category (top 2.5%) had a ____ reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared to those in the 'Low' category.",
            "options": ["20%", "40%", "Over 400% (5-fold)", "15%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 5.04 for the lowest performers compared to the elite, meaning the elite group had a 5-fold (or 400%+) lower risk of death."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When assessing functional biomarkers, why is Grip Strength considered a 'biomarker of aging' rather than just a measure of hand muscle?",
            "options": ["It is directly correlated with cognitive function and neural integrity", "It measures the thickness of the skin on the palms", "It is the only way to measure bone density without a DEXA scan", "It predicts the likelihood of developing Type 1 Diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Grip strength is a well-validated proxy for total body muscle mass, biological age, and neural integrity. Low grip strength is highly predictive of future disability, cognitive decline, and all-cause mortality."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "During the integration phase of the 'Longevity Roadmap,' which of the following should be the highest priority for intervention?",
            "options": ["Optimizing a slightly low Vitamin D level", "Correcting severe insulin resistance and high ApoB", "Starting a supplement for hair growth", "Improving flexibility for a client with 95th percentile VO2 Max"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Roadmap prioritizes 'The Big Killers.' Metabolic dysfunction (insulin resistance) and cardiovascular risk (ApoB) represent the highest immediate threats to healthspan and must be addressed before optimization of minor micronutrients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A 55-year-old male client has a chronological age of 55 but a PhenoAge of 62. His VO2 Max is in the 30th percentile. What is the primary goal for this client's 'Longevity Roadmap'?",
            "options": ["Focus solely on DNA methylation supplements", "Aggressive cardiorespiratory training to close the 'Longevity Gap' and lower biological age", "Reducing caloric intake to 1,000 calories per day", "Ignoring the biomarkers as they are within 'normal' clinical ranges"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client has a 'positive' longevity gap (older biologically than chronologically) and poor cardiorespiratory fitness. Improving VO2 Max is one of the most potent interventions to reduce biological age and improve overall survival probability."
