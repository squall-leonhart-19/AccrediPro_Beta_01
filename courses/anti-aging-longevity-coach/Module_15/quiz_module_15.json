            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AMPK acts as an energy sensor; when ATP is low, it inhibits the growth-promoting mTOR pathway to conserve energy and initiate cellular cleanup (autophagy)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. An RER of 0.95 at rest suggests the client is unable to efficiently tap into fat stores, indicating metabolic inflexibility."
