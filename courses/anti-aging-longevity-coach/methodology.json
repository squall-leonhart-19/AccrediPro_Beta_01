    {
      "letter": "V",
      "meaning": "Vascular & Mitochondrial Health",
      "description": "Focuses on optimizing cellular energy production and microcirculation to ensure tissues receive peak oxygen and nutrient delivery. This stage involves improving mitochondrial density and vascular elasticity to prevent bioenergetic decline."
    },
    {
      "letter": "I",
      "meaning": "Inflammaging & Immune Modulation",
      "description": "Addresses 'inflammaging,' the chronic, low-grade systemic inflammation that drives cellular aging. Coaches utilize targeted protocols to modulate the immune system and reduce the cytokine load that accelerates tissue degradation."
    },
    {
      "letter": "T",
      "meaning": "Telomere & DNA Integrity",
      "description": "Utilizes epigenetic interventions to protect the structural stability of the genome and maintain telomere length. By supporting DNA repair mechanisms, this principle aims to preserve the biological blueprint from oxidative and replicative stress."
    },
    {
      "letter": "A",
      "meaning": "Autophagy & Cellular Cleansing",
      "description": "Activates the body's internal 'housekeeping' system to recycle damaged proteins and organelles. This process clears the cellular 'clutter' that accumulates with age, restoring metabolic efficiency and preventing protein aggregation."
    },
    {
      "letter": "L",
      "meaning": "Lifestyle & Hormetic Stress",
      "description": "Implements controlled, beneficial stressors like thermal therapy and strategic fasting to trigger 'longevity genes' (Sirtuins). These hormetic challenges build systemic resilience and enhance the body's ability to adapt to external stressors."
    },
    {
      "letter": "S",
      "meaning": "Senescent Cell Management",
      "description": "Targets 'zombie cells' that have stopped dividing but refuse to die, secreting toxic pro-inflammatory signals to neighboring cells. This pillar focuses on senolytic strategies to prune these harmful cells and rejuvenate the systemic environment."
