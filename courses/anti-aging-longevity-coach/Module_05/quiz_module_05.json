            "question": "Which metabolic state is most conducive to cellular 'clean-up' (autophagy) and life extension according to the nutrient-sensing pathways discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "High mTOR activity and low AMPK activity",
                "High insulin levels and high IGF-1 activity",
                "Low mTOR activity and high AMPK activity",
                "Suppressed Sirtuin activity and high glucose availability"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longevity is optimized when mTOR (the growth/anabolic switch) is periodically suppressed and AMPK (the energy-sensing/catabolic switch) is activated, as this ratio triggers autophagy and cellular repair."

        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) contribute to aging through 'cross-linking.' According to Lesson 2, which cooking method produces the highest concentration of dietary AGEs (dAGEs)?",

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Protein Paradox' suggests that while low protein may favor longevity in mid-life, older adults (65+) require higher protein intake. What is the biological reason for this shift?",
            "options": [
                "Older adults have higher mTOR sensitivity",
                "Anabolic resistance requires higher leucine concentrations to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)",

                "Older adults utilize glucose more efficiently than amino acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anabolic resistance in older adults means the muscle is less responsive to protein; therefore, higher doses of protein (rich in leucine) are needed to overcome this threshold and prevent sarcopenia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Omega-3 Index (EPA+DHA in red blood cell membranes) of 8% or higher is considered the cardioprotective 'sweet spot' for longevity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenohormesis is the hypothesis that animals (including humans) have evolved to sense chemical signals of stress in plants, using them to activate their own cellular defense mechanisms."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Based on Lesson 6 (Chrono-Nutrition), what was a primary outcome for participants with metabolic syndrome who followed a 10-hour Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) window in the 2019 Salk Institute study?",
