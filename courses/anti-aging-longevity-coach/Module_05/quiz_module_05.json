            "question": "In the context of the 'Molecular Switches' of longevity, which nutritional state correctly describes the relationship between mTOR and AMPK?",
            "options": [
                "High amino acid availability activates AMPK, while glucose deprivation activates mTOR.",
                "mTOR promotes cellular growth and protein synthesis, while AMPK senses energy deficits and promotes autophagy.",
                "Both mTOR and AMPK must be simultaneously activated to achieve maximum lifespan extension.",
                "AMPK is a pro-aging pathway that should be chronically suppressed through high-calorie intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) is the primary nutrient sensor for growth and is activated by protein and insulin. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is the 'fuel gauge' that activates during energy scarcity to trigger repair and autophagy."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client's lab results show high levels of Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML). Based on Module 5, Lesson 2, which dietary adjustment would most effectively reduce the formation of these Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs)?",
            "options": [
                "Switching from steaming vegetables to high-heat stir-frying.",
                "Increasing the consumption of charred or well-done meats.",
                "Marinating meats in acidic components like lemon juice or vinegar before cooking at lower temperatures.",
                "Increasing the intake of fructose-rich corn syrup to replace glucose."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acidic marinades (lemon/vinegar) can reduce AGE formation by up to 50%. High-heat, dry cooking (grilling/frying) significantly increases AGEs, which contribute to tissue cross-linking and inflammation."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Protein Paradox' suggests that while low protein intake (0.8g/kg) may reduce IGF-1 and cancer risk in middle age, individuals over 65 should generally increase intake to what range to prevent sarcopenia?",
            "options": [
                "0.4 - 0.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.5 g/kg of body weight",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that as humans age, 'anabolic resistance' occurs. To maintain muscle mass (a key longevity predictor), older adults typically require 1.2 to 1.5g/kg of high-quality protein."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to the lessons on Longevity Lipids, what is the 'ideal' target ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids for minimizing systemic inflammation, compared to the standard Western diet (20:1)?",
            "options": [
                "Between 1:1 and 4:1",
                "Exactly 10:1",
                "1:20 (20 times more Omega-3 than Omega-6)",
                "The ratio does not matter as long as total fat is low."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A ratio of 4:1 or lower is associated with a 70% decrease in total mortality. The Western diet is heavily skewed toward pro-inflammatory Omega-6 fatty acids."

            "options": [
                "Plants produce these chemicals to provide vitamins directly to human cells.",
                "Plants under environmental stress produce compounds that activate stress-defense pathways in the humans who consume them.",
                "Phytonutrients act as a primary calorie source for mitochondrial ATP production.",
                "These compounds neutralize 100% of all free radicals in the bloodstream."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenohormesis is the biological principle where organisms (humans) respond to stress signals produced by other species (stressed plants), such as resveratrol or polyphenols, activating longevity genes like Sirtuins."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "In Chrono-Nutrition, why is it recommended to consume the majority of calories and carbohydrates earlier in the day?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin sensitivity is highest in the morning and declines in the evening due to melatonin rise.",
                "The stomach stops producing digestive enzymes after 4:00 PM.",
                "Eating at night increases the core body temperature, which is necessary for deep sleep.",
                "Cortisol levels are lowest in the morning, making it safer to eat sugar."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Circadian rhythms dictate that insulin sensitivity is peak during daylight hours. Late-night eating, when melatonin is rising, impairs glucose clearance and disrupts the molecular clocks in the liver and pancreas."

                "Cruciferous vegetables exclusively"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Across all Blue Zones (Okinawa, Sardinia, Nicoya, Ikaria, Loma Linda), legumes are the dietary mainstay, providing fiber, plant protein, and slow-burning carbohydrates."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "APOE4 carriers are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's; they often respond poorly to high saturated fats, which can lead to significant elevations in LDL-C. A Mediterranean-style approach with high Omega-3s is preferred."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sulforaphane is a powerful isothiocyanate that triggers the Nrf2 pathway, the body's master antioxidant switch, helping to protect against DNA damage and inflammation."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "According to the 'Glycemic Variability' data in Lesson 2, which of these individuals is at the highest risk for accelerated aging, even if their fasting glucose is 'normal'?",
            "options": [
                "Individual A: Stable glucose levels with a post-meal peak of 110 mg/dL.",
                "Individual B: Frequent 'spikes and crashes' ranging from 70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL daily.",
                "Individual C: Consistent glucose levels of 95 mg/dL throughout the day.",
                "Individual D: A person who fasts for 16 hours and has a single peak of 120 mg/dL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycemic variability (the 'spikes and crashes') is more predictive of oxidative stress and vascular damage than mean glucose levels alone. High variability triggers pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial dysfunction."
