            "question": "According to the lesson on Precision Epigenetics, what distinguishes the 'GrimAge' clock from first-generation epigenetic clocks like the original Horvath Clock?",
            "options": [
                "GrimAge measures only chronological age based on 353 CpG sites.",
                "GrimAge incorporates plasma protein biomarkers and smoking history to better predict mortality and healthspan.",
                "GrimAge is based solely on telomere length rather than DNA methylation.",
                "GrimAge is less accurate than first-generation clocks in clinical settings."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Second-generation clocks like GrimAge are superior predictors of healthspan and mortality because they integrate physiological biomarkers (like PAI-1 and cystatin C) with DNA methylation data."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A is a potent postbiotic that triggers mitophagy (the clearing of damaged mitochondria), which has been clinically shown to improve muscle strength and endurance in aging populations."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, what is the primary mitochondrial chromophore that absorbs light in the 600nm to 1000nm range?",
            "options": [
                "NADH Dehydrogenase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cytochrome c oxidase is the primary photo-acceptor in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Absorbing red and near-infrared light leads to increased ATP production and a transient burst of ROS that triggers signaling pathways."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Why is the 'Hit and Run' protocol (intermittent dosing) preferred over continuous administration for senolytic therapies like Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q)?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the body from developing a tolerance to the compounds.",
                "To avoid interfering with the beneficial roles of transient senescence, such as wound healing and development.",
                "Because senolytic compounds are highly toxic if taken for more than two consecutive days.",
                "To ensure that the compounds reach the extracellular matrix rather than the cells."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senescence is a natural process required for wound healing and tumor suppression. Continuous suppression could be harmful, so 'pulsed' dosing is used to clear the accumulated 'zombie' cells without stopping essential biological functions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GHK-Cu is a tri-peptide with a high affinity for copper. It is known to reset thousands of genes to a more youthful expression pattern and significantly enhance skin and tissue remodeling."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FMD reduces pro-growth signaling (IGF-1) while increasing protective proteins (IGFBP-1), which triggers cellular clean-up (autophagy) and stem cell regeneration upon refeeding."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AGEs form non-enzymatic cross-links between collagen fibers. This increases ECM stiffness, which alters the mechanical signals cells receive and contributes to the aging phenotype."
