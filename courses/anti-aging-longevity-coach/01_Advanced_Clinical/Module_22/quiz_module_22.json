            "question": "A longevity coach suggests a client begin a specific off-label dosage of Rapamycin and provides a source for the drug. Which ethical boundary has been violated?",
            "options": [
                "The coach is practicing within the 'Right to Try' framework.",
                "The coach has crossed the boundary into clinical medicine by prescribing and sourcing a regulated drug.",
                "The coach is providing 'information only' which is always protected.",
                "The coach is acting as a 'biohacking facilitator' which is a recognized legal exemption."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longevity coaches must never prescribe, source, or manage dosages of prescription medications. This is a clear violation of the scope of practice, which differentiates coaching (lifestyle/behavioral) from clinical medicine (diagnosis/treatment)."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "According to the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which of the following is NOT protected from discrimination based on a client's longevity-related genetic data?",
            "options": [
                "Health insurance coverage",
                "Employment eligibility",
                "Group health plan premiums",
                "Life insurance and long-term care insurance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While GINA protects individuals from discrimination in health insurance and employment, it notably does not cover life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance, making genetic data privacy a critical ethical discussion for coaches."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A coach promotes a 'Longevity Protocol' using the claim: 'This supplement is 100% natural, so it is inherently safer than pharmaceutical interventions.' This is an example of which logical fallacy?",
            "options": [
                "The Appeal to Novelty",
                "The Naturalistic Fallacy",

                "The Confirmation Bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Naturalistic Fallacy is the incorrect assumption that 'natural' automatically equates to 'good' or 'safe.' Many natural substances are toxic, and many synthetic ones are life-saving; longevity coaches must use evidence-based safety profiles instead."

            "question": "In the context of 'Informed Consent' for biohacking, what must a coach disclose regarding 'N-of-1' experimental interventions?",
            "options": [
                "That the intervention is guaranteed to work if the client is motivated.",
                "That the lack of large-scale clinical trials means long-term safety and side effects are unknown.",
                "That the coach's personal success with the intervention serves as clinical proof.",
                "That insurance will likely cover any complications arising from the biohack."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical biohacking requires informed consent, which includes explicitly stating that anecdotal evidence or N-of-1 trials do not account for long-term safety or systemic risks found in peer-reviewed clinical trials."

            "id": "q22_5",

                "Result in a decrease in global GDP due to an aging workforce."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Longevity Divide' is a major ethical concern where expensive interventions (like stem cell therapy or advanced diagnostics) create a gap where only the elite can afford biological age reversal, potentially creating a two-tiered society."

        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "Under Terror Management Theory (TMT), how might 'mortality salience' affect a longevity client's decision-making?",
            "options": [
                "It makes them more rational and analytical about supplement choices.",
                "It may lead to impulsive, high-risk health behaviors as a defense mechanism against death anxiety.",
                "It decreases their interest in life extension.",
                "It eliminates the need for psychological boundaries in coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mortality salience (awareness of one's death) can trigger anxiety that leads to 'existential panic,' causing clients to pursue unproven or dangerous 'miracle cures' to alleviate their fear of aging."

            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "To maintain marketing integrity, FTC guidelines require longevity coaches to disclose affiliate relationships. Which of the following is a compliant disclosure?",
            "options": [
                "A link to a 20-page 'Terms and Conditions' document at the bottom of the website.",
                "A clear and conspicuous statement near the product link stating the coach receives a commission.",
                "Using the hashtag #adv at the very end of a long caption.",
                "No disclosure is needed if the coach actually uses the product."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires disclosures to be 'clear and conspicuous.' Hiding disclosures in fine print or using ambiguous hashtags does not meet the ethical or legal standard for transparency in professional coaching."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "When evaluating a new 'longevity breakthrough' study, an ethically responsible coach should prioritize which type of evidence?",
            "options": [
                "A single-cell in-vitro study (cell culture).",
                "A press release from the supplement manufacturer's website.",
                "A systematic review or meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).",
                "A viral testimonial from a well-known biohacking influencer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses represent the highest level of evidence. Relying on cell studies or press releases often leads to 'hype' and the promotion of interventions that fail to translate to human biology."

        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client becomes obsessively focused on their biological age clock results, exhibiting signs of orthorexia and extreme anxiety. What is the coach's ethical obligation?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest more biomarkers to track to provide the client with more data.",
                "Refer the client to a licensed mental health professional specializing in eating disorders or anxiety.",
                "Tell the client to 'just relax' and ignore the data for a week.",
                "Increase the dosage of longevity supplements to improve the clock results."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client's pursuit of longevity becomes psychologically pathological (e.g., orthorexia or clinical anxiety), it is outside the coach's scope, and an immediate referral to a licensed mental health professional is required."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical risk of a coach accepting 'ghostwritten' articles from a supplement company to post on their professional blog?",
            "options": [
                "It saves the coach time but provides no SEO value.",
                "It compromises the coach's objectivity and creates an undisclosed conflict of interest.",
                "It is only an issue if the articles contain spelling errors.",
                "It is perfectly ethical as long as the coach agrees with the general message."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ghostwritten content from a commercial interest compromises the coach's role as an objective guide. It misleads the audience into thinking the content is the coach's independent expert opinion, violating the principle of professional integrity."
