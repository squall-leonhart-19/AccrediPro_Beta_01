            "question": "In the 'Metabolic Syndrome Triad,' what is the primary mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia accelerates biological aging?",
            "options": [
                "By inducing cellular senescence through the inhibition of the mTOR pathway",
                "By promoting chronic low-grade inflammation via the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-alpha",
                "By decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria",
                "By increasing the rate of telomere lengthening in somatic cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia drives 'inflammaging' by stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which creates a feedback loop of insulin resistance and systemic tissue degradation."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A 52-year-old high-performance executive presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, low Heart Rate Variability (HRV), and elevated evening cortisol. According to Module 17, what is the most appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) to 'burn off' excess cortisol",
                "Strict ketogenic dieting to stabilize executive cognitive function",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For the overstressed executive, adding high-intensity stressors (HIIT/Strict Fasting) can worsen the HPA-axis dysfunction. Prioritizing parasympathetic tone is the foundational step for longevity in high-stress populations."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis in Menopause management suggests that Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has the greatest neuroprotective and cardiovascular benefits when started:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that HRT initiated within 10 years of menopause (the 'window') provides significant protection against cognitive decline and heart disease, whereas late initiation may carry different risk profiles."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "When addressing Sarcopenic Obesity, why is a standard 'low-calorie' weight loss diet often counterproductive for longevity?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a disproportionate loss of lean muscle mass, further lowering the basal metabolic rate (BMR)",
                "It increases the risk of developing Type 1 Diabetes",
                "It prevents the body from entering a state of autophagy",
                "It causes an immediate and permanent shift in the set-point of the hypothalamus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In sarcopenic obesity, the goal is body recomposition. Standard calorie restriction without adequate protein and resistance training leads to muscle wasting (sarcopenia), which exacerbates metabolic dysfunction."

                "The discovery that fasting worsens autoimmune symptoms in 90% of cases"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The longevity paradox in autoimmunity notes that while chronic inflammation usually shortens lifespan, some exceptionally long-lived individuals possess markers of immune activity that would normally indicate pathology, suggesting a unique 'resilience' factor."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ketoflex 12/3 approach supports metabolic flexibility and autophagy, which are critical for clearing amyloid-beta and supporting synaptic health in those at genetic risk for cognitive decline."

                "That protein requirements decrease as an athlete ages"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While moderate exercise is essential for longevity, extreme lifelong endurance volume can lead to myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of arrhythmias like AFib, demonstrating a U-shaped or reverse J-shaped benefit curve."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Marginal Decade' concept (popularized by Peter Attia and discussed in Lesson 8) emphasizes training for the physical and cognitive tasks you want to be able to perform in your final decade of life."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client presents with an HbA1c of 5.8%, high hs-CRP (3.5 mg/L), and low muscle mass. Which intervention should be prioritized to address the 'Metabolic Triad' simultaneously?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance training improves insulin sensitivity (HbA1c), reduces systemic inflammation (hs-CRP) over time, and reverses sarcopenia, addressing all three components of the triad."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting in the 40s, humans typically lose about 8% of their muscle mass per decade, a rate that accelerates significantly after age 70, making early intervention critical."
