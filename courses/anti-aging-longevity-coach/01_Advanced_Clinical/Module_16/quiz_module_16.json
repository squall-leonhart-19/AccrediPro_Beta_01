            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "When assessing a client for early-stage Insulin Resistance (Lesson 1), which HOMA-IR score typically indicates the threshold for 'significant insulin resistance' despite a normal fasting glucose?",
            "options": ["HOMA-IR > 1.0", "HOMA-IR > 1.9", "HOMA-IR > 2.9", "HOMA-IR > 5.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a HOMA-IR > 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, a score above 2.9 is generally categorized as significant insulin resistance, often seen in Metabolic Syndrome even if fasting blood glucose remains within the 'normal' range."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of Neuro-Longevity (Lesson 2), which protein is considered the 'master orchestrator' of synaptic plasticity and is significantly increased by High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)?",
            "options": ["Amyloid-Beta", "Tau Protein", "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)", "Alpha-Synuclein"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BDNF is crucial for the survival of existing neurons and the growth of new ones. Studies show HIIT can increase serum BDNF by up to 30%, providing a powerful neuroprotective effect."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Timing Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 3 (Menopause), what is the optimal window for initiating Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) to maximize cardiovascular and neuroprotective benefits?",
            "options": ["Within 5 years of menopause onset or before age 60", "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60", "At least 15 years after the final menstrual period", "Only after the age of 65 to ensure safety"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Timing Hypothesis' suggests that HRT provides the most benefit and least risk when started within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60, after which the risk-to-benefit ratio shifts due to existing atherosclerotic changes."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "To overcome 'Anabolic Resistance' in a 65-year-old male client (Lesson 4), what is the minimum recommended leucine content per meal required to trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": ["0.5 - 1.0 grams", "1.2 - 1.8 grams", "2.5 - 3.0 grams", "5.0 - 7.5 grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Leucine Threshold' increases with age. While younger individuals may trigger MPS with 1.5g of leucine, older adults typically require 2.5g to 3.0g per meal to overcome anabolic resistance and prevent sarcopenia."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses 'Inflammaging.' Which molecule, when translocated from the gut into systemic circulation due to intestinal permeability, is a primary trigger for TLR4-mediated chronic inflammation?",
            "options": ["Butyrate", "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)", "Zonulin", "Short-Chain Fatty Acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria trigger systemic inflammation via the Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway when they leak through the gut barrier, a hallmark of inflammaging."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "For a High-Performance Executive (Lesson 6), a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is clinically indicative of which state?",
            "options": ["Optimal stress resilience", "Acute sympathetic dominance", "HPA-axis dysfunction or burnout", "Superior circadian alignment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-60% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A 'flat' or blunted response is a marker of chronic stress and HPA-axis exhaustion, common in executive burnout."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In the study of Athletic Longevity (Lesson 7), how does a 'High' VO2 Max (top 2.5% for age) impact the Hazard Ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality compared to the 'Low' category?",
            "options": ["It reduces mortality risk by approximately 15%", "It reduces mortality risk by approximately 30%", "It reduces mortality risk by 5-fold (nearly 80%)", "It has no significant impact on lifespan, only healthspan"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Data from Mandsager et al. (2018) showed that elite aerobic fitness (VO2 Max) was associated with a 5-fold reduction in all-cause mortality risk compared to the lowest performers, making it one of the strongest predictors of longevity."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "The 'Super-Ager Protocol' (Lesson 8) focuses on clearing senescent cells. What is the name of the pro-inflammatory secretome released by these 'zombie cells' that damages neighboring healthy tissue?",
            "options": ["SASP (Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype)", "mTORC1 Signaling Complex", "NAD+ Metabolome", "FOXO3 Transcription Factor"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Senescent cells secrete a cocktail of cytokines, growth factors, and proteases known as SASP, which spreads inflammation and promotes the aging of nearby healthy cells."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A 52-year-old male client presents with a Triglyceride/HDL ratio of 4.5. Based on the Metabolic Syndrome Case Study (Lesson 1), what is the primary intervention priority?",
            "options": ["Increasing aerobic steady-state cardio to 5 hours/week", "Implementing a carbohydrate-restricted diet to lower insulin levels", "Supplementing with high-dose Vitamin C", "Reducing dietary fat to less than 15% of total calories"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio > 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance. Reducing refined carbohydrates and sugars is the most effective way to lower triglycerides and improve insulin sensitivity."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In the Multi-System Optimization case (Lesson 8), which 'Longevity Stack' synergy is prioritized for mitochondrial biogenesis and circadian repair?",
            "options": ["Melatonin at night + morning sunlight + NAD+ precursors", "High-dose Iron + Vitamin K2", "Protein restriction + evening blue light exposure", "Statin therapy + Vitamin D3"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The combination of morning sunlight (circadian anchoring), NAD+ precursors (mitochondrial fuel), and melatonin (mitochondrial antioxidant/sleep) addresses the multi-system decline seen in aging."
