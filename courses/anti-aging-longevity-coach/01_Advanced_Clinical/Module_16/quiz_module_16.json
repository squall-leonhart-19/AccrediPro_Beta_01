            "question": "In Lesson 1, a client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 3.8 and a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.95. According to the metabolic reversal protocols, what is the primary physiological target?",
            "options": [
                "Reducing hepatic glucose production and improving peripheral insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle.",
                "Increasing caloric density to prevent age-related weight loss.",

                "Focusing exclusively on steady-state aerobic exercise at 40% VO2 max."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR >2.5 indicates significant insulin resistance. The protocol focuses on restoring insulin sensitivity through resistance training (GLUT4 translocation) and dietary interventions that reduce hepatic glucose output."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "Regarding Neuro-Longevity (Lesson 2), which physiological mechanism is responsible for the clearance of beta-amyloid and tau proteins during deep NREM sleep?",
            "options": [
                "The sympathetic nervous system's fight-or-flight response.",
                "The glymphatic system, which increases interstitial space by up to 60% during sleep.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is a waste-clearance system that utilizes CSF-interstitial fluid exchange to remove metabolic byproducts, including amyloid-beta, primarily during deep sleep."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis discussed in Lesson 3, when is Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) most effective for cardiovascular and neuroprotection?",

                "When initiated within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60.",
                "HRT has no impact on cardiovascular health regardless of timing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that initiating HRT closer to the onset of menopause (the window of opportunity) provides significant protective effects for the heart and brain, whereas late initiation may carry different risk profiles."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In the management of male sarcopenia (Lesson 4), what is the minimum threshold of leucine required per meal to overcome 'anabolic resistance' in aging muscle?",

                "Approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine.",
                "Leucine is only relevant for athletes under 30.",
                "10 grams per meal, regardless of total protein intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aging muscle requires a higher concentration of the amino acid leucine (the leucine trigger) to activate the mTORC1 pathway and initiate muscle protein synthesis compared to younger individuals."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 describes 'Inflammaging' as a driver of chronic disease. Which biomarker is most specifically used to identify intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') contributing to this state?",

                "Total white blood cell count within the normal range."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin regulates tight junctions in the gut; elevated levels, along with LPS (endotoxins) in the blood, indicate a breakdown of the intestinal barrier, fueling systemic inflammation."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A high-performance executive (Lesson 6) presents with a 'flat' Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). What does this typically signify in a clinical longevity context?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-60% rise in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A flat response is a hallmark of chronic stress and HPA-axis maladaptation."

            "question": "For the aging master athlete (Lesson 7), why is eccentric-focused resistance training specifically recommended?",
            "options": [
                "It is the only way to lose body fat.",
                "It increases resting heart rate to improve caloric burn.",
                "It improves tendon stiffness and structural integrity with lower metabolic/oxygen cost than concentric work.",
                "It prevents the absorption of Vitamin D."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eccentric training (lengthening under load) is highly effective for maintaining tendon health and muscle mass in older athletes while placing less demand on the cardiovascular system."

            "options": [
                "The client is expected to live 7 years longer than average.",
                "The client's biological age is 7 years older than their chronological age, indicating accelerated aging.",

                "The test results are invalid and should be ignored."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic age acceleration (a positive value) means the biological markers of aging are more advanced than the person's actual age in years, correlating with higher morbidity risk."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Case Study Application: A 55-year-old female client has a HbA1c of 5.9% (pre-diabetic) and severe menopausal vasomotor symptoms. What is the most evidence-based integrated approach?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen plays a role in insulin sensitivity. Addressing the hormonal transition alongside metabolic health provides a synergistic effect that improves both symptoms and long-term longevity markers."
