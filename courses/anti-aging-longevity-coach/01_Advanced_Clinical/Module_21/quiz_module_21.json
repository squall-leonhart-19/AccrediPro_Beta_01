            "question": "According to the Hierarchy of Longevity Needs, which intervention must be optimized before introducing advanced 'biohacks' like NAD+ precursors or senolytics?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Circadian alignment and sleep hygiene",
                "Metformin or Rapamycin protocols",
                "Genetic methylation testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hierarchy of Longevity Needs places foundational biological rhythms and sleep at the base. Without a stable circadian rhythm, advanced interventions have diminished efficacy and may even exacerbate systemic stress."

            "question": "During the 'Phase 1: Foundational 90-Day Reset,' what is the primary metabolic objective for a client presenting with a HOMA-IR score of 3.2?",
            "options": [
                "Maximal muscle hypertrophy",

                "Increasing VO2 max by 20%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR of 3.2 indicates insulin resistance. The first 90 days prioritize metabolic flexibility and stabilizing blood glucose before moving into more catabolic or high-stress longevity protocols."

            "question": "A 68-year-old male client (80kg) aims to prevent sarcopenia. Based on the PROT-AGE study guidelines discussed in Lesson 4, what should be his daily protein target?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To overcome anabolic resistance in older adults, clinical guidelines (PROT-AGE) suggest 1.2 to 1.5 g/kg of protein daily to maintain muscle mass and function."

            "options": [
                "30 minutes once per week",
                "150-180 minutes per week, split into 45-60 min sessions",
                "15 minutes of high-intensity sprinting daily",
                "Zone 2 is only required for elite athletes, not longevity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mitochondrial efficiency (fat oxidation) is best stimulated by 150-180 minutes of Zone 2 training per week, as shorter sessions often fail to reach the threshold for mitochondrial density improvements."

            "options": [
                "To allow the supplement to reach steady-state plasma concentration",
                "To identify specific side effects or adverse reactions to individual agents",
                "To ensure the client's placebo effect has worn off",
                "Both A and B are correct"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The sequential introduction (wash-in) allows the practitioner to monitor for both pharmacodynamic effects (benefits) and potential adverse reactions (side effects) specific to that compound."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A client's bloodwork shows an hs-CRP of 3.8 mg/L and a fasting glucose of 105 mg/dL. Based on Lesson 7, how should the protocol be adjusted?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of resistance training immediately",
                "Introduce high-dose antioxidants and reduce training volume to lower systemic inflammation",
                "Prioritize anti-inflammatory nutrition and stress management before increasing physical load",
                "The levels are normal; no adjustment is needed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP > 3.0 mg/L indicates high systemic inflammation. Adding high-intensity exercise may worsen this; the priority should be identifying the source of inflammation and using nutrition/lifestyle to lower it."

                "Longevity protocols only work for the first 5 years",
                "Biological age clocks become less accurate as a person gets older"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This principle emphasizes that foundational habits (sleep, movement, nutrition) provide the majority of healthspan benefits, while expensive biohacks offer smaller, incremental gains."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term adherence requires psychological sustainability. The 80/20 rule allows for social connection, which is a key pillar of longevity seen in 'Blue Zones' populations."

                "Bicep circumference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "VO2 Max is one of the strongest predictors of longevity; individuals in the highest quartiles of cardiorespiratory fitness have significantly lower hazard ratios for all-cause mortality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senescent cells play a role in wound healing and tissue repair. Continuous suppression of these cells without 'pulsing' can interfere with the body's natural regenerative processes."
