            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Longevity Planning,' what is the primary objective of the initial 30-day Discovery & Audit phase?",
            "options": [
                "To begin aggressive senolytic therapy immediately",
                "To establish a biological baseline through biomarkers, DNA testing, and lifestyle tracking",
                "To achieve a 10% reduction in total body fat",
                "To eliminate all carbohydrates from the client's diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Discovery phase is critical for establishing a baseline. Without objective data from biomarkers and lifestyle audits, a coach cannot create a personalized or safe longevity roadmap."

            "question": "According to the Hierarchy of Longevity Needs, which of these must be optimized before prioritizing advanced biohacking like NAD+ IV therapy?",
            "options": [
                "Exosome therapy",
                "Cryotherapy and sauna rotations",
                "Sleep architecture and circadian rhythm alignment",
                "Off-label use of pharmaceutical longevity drugs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The hierarchy dictates that foundational pillars—sleep, nutrition, and movement—must be stabilized before layering on expensive or advanced 'biohacks' which have diminishing returns without a solid base."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "During the Phase 1: Foundational 90-Day Reset, what is the target Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio for optimal metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 4.0",
                "Between 3.0 and 4.0",
                "Less than 1.5",
                "Exactly 2.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio of less than 1.5 is a key marker of insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health, which is a primary goal of the 90-Day Reset."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "When programming Advanced Nutritional protocols, what is the 'mTOR/AMPK Switch' strategy designed to achieve?",
            "options": [
                "Continuous growth and muscle protein synthesis 24/7",
                "Permanent ketosis to eliminate glucose utilization",
                "Cyclical periods of growth (mTOR) and cellular cleanup/autophagy (AMPK)",
                "Maximum caloric restriction for the duration of the client's life"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longevity nutrition isn't about constant restriction; it's about the 'switch'—cycling between anabolic states (mTOR) for repair/growth and catabolic states (AMPK) for autophagy and cellular cleanup."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client's VO2 max is a significant predictor of all-cause mortality. For longevity maintenance, what is the recommended weekly volume for Zone 2 (aerobic base) training?",

                "20 minutes once a week",
                "150–180+ minutes per week",

                "Zone 2 should be avoided to prevent oxidative stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Current longevity standards, supported by researchers like Dr. Peter Attia, suggest 150-180+ minutes of Zone 2 training weekly to build mitochondrial density and metabolic efficiency."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "When implementing a 'Supplement Stack,' why is the 'N-of-1 Staggered Entry' method used?",
            "options": [
                "To save the client money on the first month",
                "To ensure the supplements don't expire at the same time",
                "To identify specific sensitivities or benefits of each individual agent by adding them one at a time",
                "To bypass the need for blood testing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adding supplements one by one (usually every 7-14 days) allows the coach and client to monitor for specific side effects or improvements, ensuring the 'stack' is actually effective for that specific individual."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "In Phase 7 (Measuring Progress), if a client's hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) remains above 2.0 mg/L after 6 months, what is the most logical adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of HIIT workouts immediately",
                "Investigate sources of systemic inflammation, such as gut dysbiosis or chronic stress",
                "Ignore the marker as long as LDL is low",
                "Reduce sleep to 6 hours to increase productivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An hs-CRP above 2.0 indicates systemic inflammation. If foundations are met, the coach must look deeper into inflammatory drivers like gut health, latent infections, or chronic cortisol elevation."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "What is the '80/20 Longevity Rule' in the context of Long-term Maintenance and Social Integration?",
            "options": [
                "80% of the diet should be liquid, 20% solid",
                "80% adherence to the strict protocol, with 20% flexibility for social connection and life enjoyment",
                "80% of exercise should be HIIT, 20% should be walking",
                "80% of the budget should go to supplements, 20% to food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term adherence requires psychological flexibility. The 80/20 rule allows for social integration (Blue Zone principle), preventing 'orthorexia' and social isolation while maintaining 80% protocol fidelity."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Based on the Valter Longo FMD (Fasting-Mimicking Diet) studies, what is the typical protocol for metabolic rejuvenation?",
            "options": [
                "300 calories a day for 10 days every month",
                "Water-only fasting for 24 hours every week",
                "800–1100 calories of specific macro-nutrients for 5 consecutive days, 3–4 times per year",
                "Eating only during a 2-hour window every single day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The clinically validated FMD protocol involves a specific 5-day caloric and macronutrient restriction (low protein/sugar, high healthy fats) performed periodically to trigger autophagy and stem cell regeneration."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A 55-year-old client shows a significant loss of lean muscle mass (sarcopenia) despite doing 4 days of cardio. Which adjustment is most appropriate for a Longevity Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Switch 2 cardio days to heavy resistance training and increase leucine-rich protein intake",
                "Add more cardio to burn off the remaining fat",
                "Reduce total caloric intake to 1,200 calories",
                "Prescribe a 7-day water fast to reset the system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Muscle mass is 'longevity insurance.' To combat sarcopenia, the protocol must prioritize resistance training and adequate protein (specifically leucine to trigger muscle protein synthesis) over excessive steady-state cardio."
