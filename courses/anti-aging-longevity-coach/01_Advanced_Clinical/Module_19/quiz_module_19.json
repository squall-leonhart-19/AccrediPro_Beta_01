            "question": "In the hierarchy of longevity evidence, why is 'Mendelian Randomization' (MR) considered more robust than standard observational epidemiology?",
            "options": [
                "It relies on self-reported data which is more accurate over long periods",
                "It uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures to reduce confounding and reverse causation",
                "It is the only method that can prove 100% causality in human subjects",
                "It requires a smaller sample size (n < 50) to achieve statistical significance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mendelian Randomization uses the random assortment of genes at conception to mimic a randomized controlled trial, helping researchers determine if a biomarker (like Vitamin D levels) actually causes a longevity outcome or is just a bystander."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the Horvath clock measures chronological age, GrimAge was trained on surrogate biomarkers for mortality and is significantly more predictive of lifespan and healthspan outcomes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Large-scale studies (such as those by Ruiz et al.) indicate that low muscular strength is a powerful predictor of mortality, with the weakest individuals facing a 50% to 67% higher risk of death from all causes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow Wave Sleep (Stage N3) is characterized by high-amplitude delta waves and a significant increase in the interstitial space of the brain, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush out neurotoxic waste."

                "They lengthen telomeres by activating telomerase in cancer cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senolytics target 'zombie cells' (senescent cells) that refuse to die and instead secrete inflammatory factors (SASP). By clearing these cells, systemic inflammation is reduced."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Researchers found that the inhabitants of Roseto, PA, had extremely low rates of heart disease despite smoking and eating lard, attributed to their tight-knit, multi-generational social structure."
