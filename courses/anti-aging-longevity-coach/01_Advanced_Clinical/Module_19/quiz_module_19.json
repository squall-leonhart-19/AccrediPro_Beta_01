            "question": "In the hierarchy of longevity evidence, why is Mendelian Randomization (MR) considered more robust than traditional observational studies?",
            "options": [
                "It uses randomized controlled trials to determine causation in real-time.",
                "It uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures to reduce confounding and reverse causation.",
                "It relies exclusively on animal models which allow for more aggressive interventions.",
                "It is the only method that can prove 100% biological age reversal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mendelian Randomization uses genetic variants (which are randomly assigned at birth) to mimic the structure of an RCT, helping researchers determine if a biomarker actually causes a disease or is just a bystander."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses (such as Garcia-Hermoso et al.) indicate that low muscle strength is associated with a 1.67 times higher risk of all-cause mortality, making strength a more potent predictor than muscle mass alone."

                "It demonstrated that Metformin is superior to Rapamycin in all animal models.",
                "It focused exclusively on the use of Metformin for weight loss in teenagers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The TAME trial is a landmark because it seeks to shift the regulatory paradigm by testing if a drug can delay the onset of multiple age-related chronic diseases simultaneously."
