            "question": "Within the A.G.E.L.E.S.S. Longevity Protocol™, what is the primary objective of the first 'A' (Assess Biomarkers) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To diagnose chronic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' in the A.G.E.L.E.S.S. methodology stands for 'Assess Biomarkers.' Its goal is to establish a baseline of biological aging (using tools like epigenetic clocks or blood-based algorithms) to measure the efficacy of subsequent interventions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The study (n=122,007) demonstrated that extremely high aerobic fitness (Elite) was associated with a 5-fold (500%) reduction in mortality risk compared to those in the lowest fitness category, making VO2 Max one of the strongest predictors of longevity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMPK acts as an energy sensor. When cellular energy is low (fasting/exercise), AMPK is activated, which subsequently inhibits mTOR and stimulates autophagy (cellular cleanup)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NAD+ levels decline with age. Supplementing with precursors like NMN or NR aims to restore NAD+ levels, which are essential cofactors for Sirtuins (longevity genes) and enzymes that repair damaged DNA."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ikigai and Plan de Vida both translate to having a clear purpose in life. Research, including meta-analyses by Holt-Lunstad, shows that high levels of purpose and social connection are as protective for health as quitting smoking."
