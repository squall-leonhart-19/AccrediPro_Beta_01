            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those by Boyle et al., have shown that a strong sense of purpose is specifically correlated with lower levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives the 'inflammaging' process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The protocol prioritizes stabilization; adding the hormetic stress of intense exercise to a system already overwhelmed by chronic stress (high cortisol) can lead to burnout, injury, and increased systemic inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first phase focuses on 'low-hanging fruit' and foundational health—sleep, nutrition, and circadian alignment—to ensure the body is resilient enough for more advanced longevity interventions later."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A major ethical debate in longevity science is 'Socioeconomic Stratification,' where life-extending technologies (like senolytics or gene therapy) might only be available to the elite, creating a biological divide in the human species."
