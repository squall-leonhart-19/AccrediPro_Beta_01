                "It mandates a specific caloric restriction protocol",
                "It provides a 'social safety net' that buffers the HPA axis and reduces chronic cortisol",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced interventions are less effective—and potentially wasted—if the client's inflammatory markers are high due to poor foundational habits like sleep deprivation or processed diet."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs act as 'obesogens' by activating PPAR-gamma, which triggers the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes (fat cells) and alters metabolic set points."
