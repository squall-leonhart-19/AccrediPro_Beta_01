            "question": "Which of the following best describes the physiological distinction between sarcopenia and dynapenia?",
            "options": [
                "Sarcopenia refers to the loss of muscle quality, while dynapenia refers to the loss of muscle mass.",
                "Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass, while dynapenia is the age-related loss of muscle strength and power.",
                "Dynapenia is a precursor to sarcopenia and only affects Type I muscle fibers.",
                "Sarcopenia is only seen in sedentary individuals, while dynapenia is seen in athletes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarcopenia is defined by the loss of muscle quantity (mass), whereas dynapenia refers specifically to the loss of muscle strength and functional power, which often declines at a rate 2-3 times faster than mass."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

                "Type II fibers are more efficient at burning fat than Type I fibers.",
                "Type II fibers are the first to atrophy with age, leading to a loss of power and increased fall risk.",
                "Type II fibers do not require recovery time between sessions.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Age-related muscle atrophy disproportionately affects Type II (fast-twitch) fibers, which are critical for rapid force production and preventing falls."
