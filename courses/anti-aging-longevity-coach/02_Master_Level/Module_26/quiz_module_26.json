            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "When converting biomarkers into a 12-month roadmap (Lesson 1), which phase is traditionally prioritized in the first 0-90 days to ensure systemic stability?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive senolytic clearance and stem cell activation",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and maximal strength testing",
                "Inflammation reduction and gut barrier restoration",
                "Advanced hormone replacement therapy optimization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 1 emphasizes that the first 90 days should focus on 'Foundational Stabilization,' which involves reducing systemic inflammation (hs-CRP) and fixing gut permeability before layering on more intensive metabolic stressors."

        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In the 'Gut-First Architecture' (Lesson 2), what is the primary reason for sequencing 'Removal' before 'Reinnoculation'?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the 'die-off' effect from occurring later in the program",
                "To clear pathogenic overgrowth and biofilms so that probiotics can effectively colonize",
                "To increase the metabolic rate before introducing high-fiber prebiotics",
                "To ensure the client loses weight before starting the microbiome protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 teaches that introducing probiotics into an environment with significant dysbiosis or SIBO can lead to poor colonization or symptom exacerbation; clearing the 'weeds' first is essential for the 'seeds' to grow."

        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to Movement Periodization (Lesson 3), what is the optimal resistance training intensity to stimulate myofibrillar protein synthesis and combat sarcopenia in adults over 50?",
            "options": [
                "10-20% of 1RM with extremely high repetitions",
                "30-40% of 1RM focusing only on eccentric movements",
                "60-80% of 1RM for 8-12 repetitions",
                "95-100% of 1RM for 1 repetition daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 3 cites research showing that 60-80% of 1RM is the 'sweet spot' for hypertrophy and strength gains in older populations, balancing mechanical tension with joint safety."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Engineering Environment.' What specific light exposure metric is recommended within 30 minutes of waking to optimize the cortisol awakening response?",
            "options": [
                "At least 500 lux for 5 minutes",
                "At least 10,000 lux for 20-30 minutes",
                "Blue-light filtering glasses for the first 2 hours",
                "Standard indoor lighting (approx. 300 lux) for 1 hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To reset the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and regulate the circadian rhythm, Lesson 4 recommends high-intensity light (10,000 lux), which is roughly equivalent to being outdoors on a cloudy day."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In Nutritional Programming (Lesson 5), which metabolic state is intentionally triggered by Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) and protein cycling to promote cellular 'housecleaning'?",
            "options": [
                "mTOR activation",
                "AMPK activation and Autophagy",
                "Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) peaking",
                "Glycogen supercompensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 explains the 'Longevity Seesaw': AMPK activation (via fasting/TRF) inhibits mTOR and triggers autophagy, the process of clearing damaged cellular components."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Hit and Run' protocol described in Lesson 6 regarding Senolytic supplements like Dasatinib or Quercetin?",
            "options": [
                "Taking a low dose every single day for 12 months",
                "Taking a massive dose once a year only",
                "Intermittent, high-dose pulses (e.g., 2-3 days) followed by weeks of non-use",
                "Taking the supplement only immediately after a high-intensity workout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senolytics are designed to clear senescent cells, not provide continuous nutritional support. Lesson 6 highlights that intermittent pulsing ('hit and run') is the standard clinical approach to avoid disrupting normal cell signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "According to the Blue Zone programmatic elements (Lesson 7), the Holt-Lunstad meta-analysis found that strong social connections increase the likelihood of survival by what percentage?",

                "15%",
                "25%",
                "50%",
                "90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 references the landmark 2010 meta-analysis showing that social connection is as significant a predictor of longevity as quitting smoking, providing a 50% increased likelihood of survival."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "When monitoring a client's progress (Lesson 8), why is it recommended to wait at least 3 months before re-testing HbA1c?",
            "options": [
                "Because HbA1c measures the average blood sugar over the 90-day lifespan of a red blood cell",
                "Because it takes 3 months for the liver to process glucose changes",
                "Because insurance companies do not allow more frequent testing",
                "Because dietary changes do not affect blood sugar until the 12-week mark"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "HbA1c reflects glycosylated hemoglobin; since red blood cells live for approximately 120 days, testing sooner than 3 months (90 days) will not provide an accurate picture of the new 'average' resulting from the intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Sarcopenic Obesity' (high body fat, low muscle mass). Based on Lesson 3 and 5, what is the most effective programmatic strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Chronic caloric restriction with high-volume steady-state cardio",
                "Protein-sparing modified fasts (PSMF) combined with daily HIIT",
                "Resistance training (mTOR phase) cycled with TRF (AMPK phase) and 1.6g/kg+ protein intake",
                "Strict ketogenic diet with no resistance training to prioritize fat loss first"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To address sarcopenic obesity, the coach must stimulate muscle growth (mTOR/Resistance/Protein) while simultaneously improving metabolic flexibility and fat oxidation (AMPK/TRF)."

        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, which supplement is noted for its ability to activate Sirtuins but requires a 'fat-gate' (consumption with healthy fats) for optimal absorption?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Resveratrol",
                "Magnesium Threonate",
                "Creatine Monohydrate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound with notoriously poor bioavailability. Lesson 6 explains that consuming it with a fat source (like yogurt or olive oil) significantly increases its absorption."
