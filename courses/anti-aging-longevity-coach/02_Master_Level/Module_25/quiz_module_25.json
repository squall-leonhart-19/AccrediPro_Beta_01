            "question": "In the 'Architecture of Longevity Supervision,' what is the primary objective of the 'Clinical Audit' phase conducted by a supervisor?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the coach's hourly billing rate",
                "To ensure the junior coach's recommendations align with the A.G.E.L.E.S.S. framework and safety protocols",
                "To provide emotional therapy for the junior coach",
                "To sell additional biomarker testing kits to the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Clinical Audit phase is a quality control mechanism designed to ensure that the practitioner's interventions are evidence-based, safe, and strictly follow the established longevity framework."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "When supervising the interpretation of DNA Methylation (DNAm) clocks, a supervisor must ensure the junior coach understands the 'Mean Absolute Error' (MAE). Why is this critical?",
            "options": [
                "It determines the cost of the test",
                "It accounts for the statistical variance (often 2.5–3.9 years) to prevent overstating a client's 'rejuvenation' progress",
                "It measures the client's adherence to the supplement protocol",
                "It is a requirement for FDA approval of the test"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding MAE is vital because biological age tests have a margin of error. A supervisor must ensure coaches don't claim a 2-year reduction in age if it falls within the test's inherent statistical noise."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "In the A.G.E.L.E.S.S. Framework mentoring model, the 'G' stands for 'Gut & Glycemic Control.' What specific competency should a mentor look for in a junior coach regarding this pillar?",
            "options": [
                "The ability to prescribe insulin to diabetic clients",
                "The skill to interpret Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data for metabolic flexibility, not just disease management",
                "The knowledge of how to perform a colonoscopy",
                "The ability to sell high-dose probiotic supplements"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In longevity coaching, the focus is on optimizing metabolic health (metabolic flexibility) using data like CGM, rather than medical diagnosis or treatment of pathology."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "According to the Advanced Ethical Oversight guidelines, what is the correct supervisory action if a coach is found to be recommending 'off-label' use of pharmaceutical longevity drugs (e.g., Rapamycin)?",
            "options": [
                "Encourage the coach to find a cheaper source for the client",
                "Ignore it if the client is seeing good results",
                "Mandate the coach refer the client to a licensed physician for prescription and monitoring, as this is outside the coaching scope",
                "Provide the coach with a list of pharmacies that don't require prescriptions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches cannot prescribe or recommend the off-label use of pharmaceuticals. Ethical oversight requires that such interventions be managed exclusively by licensed medical professionals."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "Which form of supervision involves a group of peer longevity coaches meeting to discuss cases without a formal senior lead, focusing on 'collective intelligence'?",
            "options": [
                "Hierarchical Supervision",
                "Normative Supervision",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Peer-Intervision (or Peer Supervision) is a non-hierarchical model where practitioners of similar status provide mutual feedback and support to improve practice."

                "What were you feeling at the time?",

                "What would you do differently next time?"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Evaluation stage of Gibbs' Cycle focuses on making a judgment about what went well and what didn't in the situation being reflected upon."

            "question": "A key performance metric (KPI) for a longevity coach, as discussed in Lesson 7, is the 'DunedinPACE' slope. What does a supervisor look for in this metric?",
            "options": [
                "A slope greater than 1.0, indicating rapid aging",
                "A reduction in the pace of aging below 1.0, signifying slowed biological decline",
                "The total number of steps the client takes per day",
                "The client's total cholesterol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DunedinPACE measures the 'speedometer' of aging. A successful intervention, supervised correctly, should ideally show a pace of aging below 1.0 (one biological year per chronological year)."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "When scaling a longevity practice through mentorship, why is 'Inter-rater Reliability' important?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure all coaches charge the same price",
                "To ensure that different coaches interpreting the same biomarker data arrive at the same recommendations",
                "To increase the speed of client onboarding",
                "To reduce the cost of marketing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inter-rater reliability ensures consistency across a practice. If two coaches look at the same data and give different advice, the practice lacks the standardization necessary for scaling."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "In a case study from Lesson 4, a coach faced 'Scope Creep' by attempting to treat a client's clinical depression with longevity supplements. What was the supervisor's primary role in this intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To suggest higher doses of Vitamin D",
                "To identify the risk and facilitate an immediate referral to a mental health professional",
                "To teach the coach more about neurotransmitters",
                "To congratulate the coach on their holistic approach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervisors must mitigate risk by ensuring coaches do not attempt to treat clinical conditions (like depression) which require specialized medical or psychological intervention."
