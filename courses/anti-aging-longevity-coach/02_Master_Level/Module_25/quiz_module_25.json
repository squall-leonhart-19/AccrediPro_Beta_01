            "question": "In the context of the A.G.E.L.E.S.S. Framework (Lesson 3), what is the primary objective when a mentor supervises a junior coach's 'Assessment' (A) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the junior coach is diagnosing medical conditions correctly.",
                "To verify the accuracy of biomarker data collection and the identification of 'Longevity Gaps'.",
                "To mandate the use of specific pharmaceutical interventions.",
                "To focus solely on the client's subjective happiness scores."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In longevity coaching, the supervisor ensures the junior coach can accurately identify 'Longevity Gaps'—the delta between current biomarkers and optimal longevity ranges—without overstepping into medical diagnosis."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Biomarker Supervision, if a junior coach reports a client has a 5-year increase in 'PhenoAge' over three months, what is the supervisor's first priority?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct the coach to double the client's antioxidant supplementation immediately.",
                "Dismiss the data as a laboratory error without further investigation.",
                "Guide the coach to investigate acute stressors or inflammatory events (e.g., recent infection or high CRP) that may have skewed the data.",
                "Recommend the coach refer the client to an oncologist immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supervisors must teach coaches that epigenetic and phenotypic clocks can be influenced by acute inflammation; a 2021 study showed transient 'aging' during severe stress or illness that often reverses upon recovery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The formative function (educational) is critical in longevity coaching to build the practitioner's competency in complex areas like nutrigenomics and bio-hacking protocols."

                "The coach should provide the dosage based on current longevity research.",
                "The coach should suggest a reliable overseas pharmacy where it can be purchased without a prescription.",
                "The coach must defer to the interdisciplinary medical director or the client's physician, focusing only on lifestyle support for the medication's side effects.",
                "The coach should ignore the request to avoid legal liability."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical oversight requires strict adherence to scope of practice. Coaches support the lifestyle 'terrain' while medical professionals handle prescription longevity therapeutics."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Balint groups are used in peer supervision to explore the psychological and emotional nuances of the practitioner-client dyad, which is essential for preventing coach burnout."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client adherence is a leading indicator of coaching efficacy. High-level biomarker changes are 'lagging indicators' that only manifest if the coach successfully facilitates behavior change."

                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms.",
                "Reflection-in-action happens during the coaching session; reflection-on-action happens after the session has concluded.",
                "Reflection-in-action is for junior coaches; reflection-on-action is for senior mentors.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Donald Schön’s model identifies reflection-in-action as the ability of a coach to adjust their approach 'in the moment' based on client cues, while reflection-on-action is the post-hoc analysis of the encounter."

            "id": "q25_8",
            "question": "When scaling a longevity practice (Lesson 8), why is a 'Standardized Mentorship System' superior to 'Ad-hoc Mentoring'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the lead practitioner to stop working entirely.",
                "It ensures 'Clinical Concordance,' meaning clients receive the same high standard of evidence-based longevity care regardless of which coach they see.",
                "It is cheaper to implement because it requires no documentation.",
                "It focuses on hiring coaches with the lowest salary requirements."

            "id": "q25_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, what is the 'Supervisory Red Flag' regarding a junior coach's interpretation of a client's DNA Methylation (GrimAge) report?",
            "options": [
                "The coach explains that the result is a statistical probability, not a fixed destiny.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Telling a client a definitive date of death based on an epigenetic clock is a major ethical and competency violation; these tests measure biological 'wear and tear' and risk, not a countdown clock."
