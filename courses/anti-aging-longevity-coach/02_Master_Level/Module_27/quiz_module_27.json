            "question": "In the context of High-Performance Athletes (L1), why is the timing of high-dose antioxidant supplementation critical for longevity and performance?",
            "options": [
                "Antioxidants should only be taken during the workout to prevent all oxidative stress.",
                "High doses immediately post-exercise can blunt the hormetic response and inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis.",
                "Antioxidants are only effective if taken 4 hours before a high-intensity session.",
                "Antioxidants have no impact on mitochondrial adaptation regardless of timing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Antioxidant Paradox' suggests that while oxidative stress is damaging, the ROS produced during exercise acts as a signaling molecule for mitochondrial adaptation. Suppressing this with high-dose Vitamin C or E immediately post-exercise can hinder long-term performance gains."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "According to the Neuro-Longevity lesson (L2), which lifestyle intervention is most effective for clearing amyloid-beta plaques via the glymphatic system?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed in the late evening.",
                "A ketogenic diet with at least 80% fat intake.",
                "Optimizing deep sleep (Stage N3) and maintaining a consistent circadian rhythm.",
                "Daily consumption of 500mg of Caffeine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is primarily active during deep (slow-wave) sleep. It functions as a waste-clearance system for the brain, removing metabolic byproducts like amyloid-beta that are linked to Alzheimer's disease."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "When managing Hormonal Optimization for Andropause (L3), why is it vital to monitor the Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) level alongside Total Testosterone?",
            "options": [
                "SHBG is the primary hormone responsible for muscle protein synthesis.",
                "High SHBG can result in low 'Free Testosterone' even if Total Testosterone appears normal.",
                "SHBG levels determine the rate of conversion from Testosterone to DHT.",
                "Low SHBG is the only clinical marker used to diagnose prostate issues."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SHBG binds to testosterone, making it biologically inactive. A client may have 'normal' total testosterone but suffer from deficiency symptoms if high SHBG levels prevent enough free testosterone from reaching the tissues."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "The 'Executive Longevity Protocol' (L4) emphasizes Heart Rate Variability (HRV). What does a consistently low SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) typically indicate in a high-stress professional?",
            "options": [
                "High cardiovascular fitness and excellent recovery.",
                "A state of parasympathetic dominance and relaxation.",
                "Chronic sympathetic nervous system overactivation and poor stress resilience.",
                "Optimal autonomic balance and metabolic flexibility."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low HRV (specifically low SDNN) indicates that the autonomic nervous system is stuck in a 'fight or flight' (sympathetic) state, which is a precursor to burnout and increased cardiovascular risk in executives."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5 (Metabolic Syndrome), what is the optimal HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score for a client pursuing maximum longevity?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR > 3.0",
                "HOMA-IR between 2.0 and 2.5",
                "HOMA-IR < 1.0",
                "HOMA-IR is not a relevant metric for longevity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While clinical 'normal' ranges are often broader, longevity specialists typically aim for a HOMA-IR below 1.0 (or at least <1.5) to ensure peak insulin sensitivity and minimal systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Regarding Aesthetic Longevity (L6), how does the 'Gut-Skin Axis' influence the progression of 'inflammaging' in the dermis?",
            "options": [
                "Intestinal permeability (leaky gut) allows LPS endotoxins into circulation, triggering systemic inflammation that degrades collagen.",
                "The gut microbiome produces sebum directly, which protects the skin from UV rays.",
                "Skin health is entirely genetic and unaffected by gastrointestinal health.",
                "Probiotics in the gut physically migrate to the skin surface to form a protective barrier."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Dysbiosis and intestinal permeability lead to the translocation of Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream, which increases systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines that accelerate the breakdown of the skin's extracellular matrix."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "For the 'Silver Generation' (75+) in Lesson 7, what is the recommended daily protein intake to overcome 'Anabolic Resistance' and prevent sarcopenia?",
            "options": [
                "0.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "0.8 g/kg of body weight (Standard RDA)",
                "1.2 to 1.5 g/kg of body weight",
                "Protein should be restricted to less than 10% of total calories to inhibit mTOR."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Older adults require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5 g/kg) and higher leucine thresholds per meal to stimulate muscle protein synthesis due to age-related anabolic resistance."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Post-Illness Recovery (L8), why is NAD+ depletion a concern following a significant viral infection?",
            "options": [
                "Viruses use NAD+ as their primary fuel source for replication.",
                "The activation of PARP enzymes (for DNA repair) and CD38 (for immune response) rapidly consumes NAD+ stores.",
                "NAD+ depletion is only a concern in bacterial infections, not viral ones.",
                "NAD+ levels actually increase during illness to protect the mitochondria."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During immune activation and cellular stress, enzymes like PARPs (Poly ADP-ribose polymerases) are upregulated to repair DNA, which can exhaust the cellular pool of NAD+, leading to the profound fatigue often seen post-illness."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A 52-year-old female client (L3) presents with brain fog, night sweats, and a DEXA T-score of -1.5. Which intervention is most supported by longevity data for her 'Osteopenia' stage?",
            "options": [
                "Complete avoidance of weight-bearing exercise to prevent fractures.",
                "High-dose calcium carbonate supplementation (2000mg/day) without Vitamin K2.",
                "Resistance training combined with optimized Vitamin D3, K2, and potentially Bioidentical HRT.",
                "A low-protein diet to reduce acidity in the blood."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of mechanical loading (resistance training) and the synergistic effects of D3/K2 for calcium signaling, along with the bone-protective effects of estrogen (HRT), is the gold standard for managing bone density loss."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to the Executive Longevity Protocol (L4), 'Decision Fatigue' is best mitigated by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming high-glucose snacks every 2 hours to fuel the prefrontal cortex.",
                "Reducing 'low-value' decisions through routine and prioritizing 'high-leverage' tasks during peak circadian alertness.",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to 600mg+ daily to maintain focus.",
                "Working in 4-hour blocks without breaks to maintain 'flow state'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longevity for executives involves cognitive energy management. Automating minor decisions and aligning difficult tasks with the individual's biological prime time preserves executive function and reduces the stress response associated with fatigue."
