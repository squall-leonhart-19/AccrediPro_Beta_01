            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction during resistance training stimulates GLUT4 transporters to move to the cell surface, allowing glucose uptake even in the presence of insulin resistance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') allows LPS and cytokines to enter systemic circulation, triggering low-grade inflammation that degrades collagen and elastin in the skin."
