            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "In Lesson 1, the 'Longevity Crisis' is defined by a significant gap between biological and chronological age. According to clinical data, a 'Rapid Ager' is typically classified as someone whose biological age exceeds their chronological age by at least how many years?",
            "options": ["3 years", "5 years", "10 years", "15 years"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A biological age gap of 10+ years (Decelerated vs. Accelerated aging) is the clinical threshold used in the module to identify a 'Rapid Aging' crisis requiring immediate intervention."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client is taking Metformin for longevity, a statin for lipids, and has recently been prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for new-onset reflux caused by the Metformin. This scenario is a classic example of:",
            "options": ["Synergistic Supplementation", "The Prescribing Cascade", "Metabolic Optimization", "Polypharmacy Synergy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The prescribing cascade occurs when a new drug is prescribed to treat the side effects of an existing medication, often mistaken for a new medical condition."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "When dealing with Neurodegenerative Emergencies (Lesson 3), what is the primary clinical distinction between Dementia and Delirium that a coach must recognize?",
            "options": ["Dementia is acute; Delirium is chronic", "Delirium involves a sudden, fluctuating change in consciousness and attention", "Dementia always involves a fever", "Delirium is caused only by genetic factors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Delirium is an acute medical emergency characterized by sudden onset and fluctuating attention, whereas dementia is a slow, progressive decline."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 4 regarding 'Acute Sarcopenia' shows that an older adult (65+) confined to bed rest for 10 days can lose approximately how much lean muscle mass?",
            "options": ["200 grams", "500 grams", "1 kilogram", "3 kilograms"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Kortebein et al.) demonstrate that healthy older adults can lose approximately 1kg (2.2 lbs) of lean leg mass in just 10 days of bed rest, representing a 'Frailty Pivot' point."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A 'Metabolic Storm' (Lesson 5) is often characterized by uncontrolled glycation. Which biomarker level is most indicative of a crisis state where protein cross-linking is causing systemic tissue damage?",
            "options": ["HbA1c > 8.0%", "Fasting Glucose of 95 mg/dL", "Triglycerides of 140 mg/dL", "HDL of 50 mg/dL"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An HbA1c above 8.0% indicates severe, uncontrolled glycation and significantly elevated risk for microvascular and macrovascular complications, constituting a metabolic crisis."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the meta-analysis by Holt-Lunstad cited in Lesson 6, the mortality risk of chronic social isolation and lack of purpose is equivalent to smoking how many cigarettes per day?",
            "options": ["5 cigarettes", "10 cigarettes", "15 cigarettes", "25 cigarettes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark study found that social isolation carries a mortality risk comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, making psychosocial health a critical longevity intervention."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Triage' (Lesson 7), which of the following 'Red Flags' requires an immediate referral to a clinical environment rather than a coaching adjustment?",
            "options": ["A 2lb weight gain over a month", "Sudden, unexplained shortness of breath at rest", "Mild muscle soreness after a new workout", "A desire to change supplement brands"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sudden shortness of breath (dyspnea) at rest is a 'Red Flag' indicating potential cardiac or pulmonary distress, requiring immediate clinical evaluation."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "When performing a 'Case Reconstruction' for a treatment-resistant client (Lesson 8), what is the first step a coach should take?",
            "options": ["Increase the dosage of all supplements", "Double the exercise intensity", "Identify the 'Anchor' (the primary physiological or lifestyle barrier)", "Refer the client to a different coach"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case Reconstruction begins with identifying the 'Anchor'—the core issue (e.g., hidden inflammation, sleep apnea, or non-compliance) that is preventing other interventions from working."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "According to the 'Beers Criteria' discussed in Lesson 2, which class of medications is generally considered high-risk for older adults due to the risk of falls and cognitive impairment?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D3", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Benzodiazepines", "Magnesium Glycinate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate for older adults due to increased risks of cognitive decline, delirium, and falls."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A client undergoes a 'Frailty Pivot' following a hip fracture. What is the priority intervention during the first 30 days of recovery to prevent permanent disability?",
            "options": ["Aggressive caloric restriction to prevent weight gain", "High-protein intake (1.5-2.0g/kg) and progressive mobilization", "Complete bed rest for 4 weeks", "Low-protein, high-carbohydrate 'comfort' diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To combat acute sarcopenia post-injury, the 'Frailty Pivot' protocol prioritizes high protein intake and early, safe mobilization to preserve lean mass and functional independence."
