            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "When synthesizing advanced biomarkers, a Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio greater than 2.0 is most significantly indicative of which underlying pathology?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio >2.0 is a strong predictor of insulin resistance and suggests the presence of atherogenic small, dense LDL (Pattern B), which increases cardiovascular risk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aligning intensity with the peak core body temperature (late afternoon/early evening) optimizes muscle power, reduces injury risk, and preserves the morning cortisol awakening response."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "In Precision Nutrigenomics, why is it critical to assess the COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) gene before recommending high-dose epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)?",
            "options": [
                "COMT regulates the metabolism of polyphenols and catecholamines; 'Slow COMT' individuals may experience anxiety or jitteriness with high EGCG intake",
                "EGCG inhibits COMT, which can lead to dangerously low levels of dopamine",
                "COMT is only involved in bone density, not nutrient metabolism",
                "EGCG is only effective in individuals with the 'Fast COMT' variant"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Individuals with the 'Slow' COMT variant (Met/Met) metabolize catechols slowly; since EGCG is a COMT inhibitor, it can further slow the breakdown of stress hormones, leading to overstimulation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hormetic Floor is the threshold that must be crossed to stimulate pathways like Nrf2 or AMPK; interventions below this floor fail to produce longevity benefits."
