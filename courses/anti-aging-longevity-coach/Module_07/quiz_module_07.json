            "question": "According to the neurobiological research discussed in Lesson 1, how does oxytocin primarily influence the HPA axis during social bonding?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the release of ACTH to increase alertness.",
                "It downregulates the HPA axis, reducing the secretion of cortisol.",
                "It has no significant effect on the HPA axis, acting only on the amygdala.",
                "It increases the sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin acts as a powerful buffer against stress by downregulating the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, thereby reducing cortisol levels and promoting a state of physiological calm."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research indicated a 17% reduction in all-cause mortality for individuals with a high sense of purpose, likely due to better stress regulation and healthier lifestyle choices."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Helper’s High' is the physiological response to altruism, where the brain's reward centers release endorphins and dopamine, leading to reduced stress and enhanced well-being."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
