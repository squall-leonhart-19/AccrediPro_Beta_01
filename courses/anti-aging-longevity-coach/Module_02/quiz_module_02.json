            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS (endotoxins) from Gram-negative bacteria leak through a compromised gut barrier and bind to Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) on immune cells, triggering a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response known as inflammaging."

                "Increased salivary amylase activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Stomach acid (HCl) production naturally declines with age. Hypochlorhydria leads to poor protein digestion, nutrient malabsorption (B12, minerals), and potential bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain bacteria that 'un-couples' toxins and hormones that the liver has already neutralized, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream."
