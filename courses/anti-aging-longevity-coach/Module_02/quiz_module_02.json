            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) contribute to the phenomenon of 'inflammaging' in the elderly?",
            "options": [
                "LPS binds to TLR4 receptors, triggering a pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LPS is an endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria that crosses a permeable gut barrier, binds to Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), and activates the NF-κB pathway, leading to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation (inflammaging)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; elevated levels are a primary marker for 'leaky gut' and are triggered by triggers like gluten and dysbiosis."
