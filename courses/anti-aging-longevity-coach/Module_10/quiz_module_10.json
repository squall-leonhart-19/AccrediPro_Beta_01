            "question": "Which epigenetic clock is specifically recognized as a 'second-generation' clock because it was trained to predict mortality and lifespan rather than just chronological age?",
            "options": [
                "The Horvath Clock (2013)",
                "The Hannum Clock (2013)",

                "The Pedlow Clock"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While first-generation clocks like Horvath and Hannum predict chronological age, second-generation clocks like GrimAge and PhenoAge are trained on health outcomes and mortality, making them better predictors of biological 'wear and tear'."

            "question": "In the context of the microbiome, what is the primary longevity benefit of the postbiotic Urolithin A?",
            "options": [
                "It acts as a direct antimicrobial against H. pylori",
                "It induces mitophagy, the selective recycling of damaged mitochondria",

                "It eliminates the need for dietary fiber consumption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urolithin A is a metabolite produced by gut bacteria from ellagitannins. Its most significant longevity benefit is the induction of mitophagy, which improves mitochondrial quality and muscle function."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autophagy is inhibited by high nutrient availability and insulin, which activate mTORC1. To induce autophagy, mTORC1 must be suppressed, usually through fasting or exercise."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Early morning light exposure (specifically blue-green wavelengths) triggers the SCN to set the internal clock, suppressing melatonin during the day and ensuring a more robust release approximately 12-14 hours later."
