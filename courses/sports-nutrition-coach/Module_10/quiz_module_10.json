            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "In the 'Train Low, Compete High' paradigm, what is the primary molecular signaling pathway activated by low glycogen availability that leads to mitochondrial biogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "The mTORC1 pathway via leucine sensing",
                "The AMPK-PGC-1α axis",
                "The AKT-insulin signaling cascade",
                "The MyoD myogenic regulatory factor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low glycogen availability increases the AMP:ATP ratio, activating AMPK (Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase), which subsequently upregulates PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "To optimize the ATP-PCr energy system for power athletes, what is the scientifically recommended work-to-rest ratio to ensure near-complete phosphocreatine resynthesis?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 to 1:3",

                "1:2 to 1:4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Full resynthesis of phosphocreatine (PCr) takes approximately 5-8 minutes; therefore, high-intensity efforts of 5-10 seconds require long recovery periods (1:12 to 1:20) to maintain power output in subsequent sets."

                "85-90% of VO2 max"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While sedentary individuals reach FatMax at lower intensities, highly trained athletes demonstrate a shift to the right, often reaching peak fat oxidation between 60-75% of VO2 max due to increased mitochondrial density."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that ~2.5 to 3.0 grams of Leucine is required to fully saturate the mTORC1 pathway, a concept known as the 'Leucine Trigger' or 'Leucine Threshold'."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Curcumin has poor systemic bioavailability; however, studies have shown that 20mg of piperine administered with 2g of curcumin increases bioavailability by 2000% in humans."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While isotonic drinks match blood osmolality, hypotonic solutions (<270 mOsm/kg) often result in faster gastric emptying and more rapid water absorption via the osmotic gradient."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sleep Low' model involves a high-intensity glycogen-depleting session in the evening, followed by carbohydrate restriction overnight, and a fasted submaximal session the following morning to maximize PGC-1α expression."
