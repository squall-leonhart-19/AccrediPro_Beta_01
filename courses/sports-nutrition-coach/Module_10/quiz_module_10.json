            "question": "During the mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, what physiological shift most significantly impacts an athlete's performance in hot/humid environments?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in resting heart rate by 10-15%",
                "An increase in basal body temperature of 0.3°C to 0.5°C",

                "A reduction in sweat sodium concentration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the mid-luteal phase, elevated progesterone causes an increase in basal body temperature (0.3-0.5°C), which can decrease the threshold for sweating and reduce heat tolerance during exercise."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Energy Availability' (EA) framework discussed in the RED-S case study, what is the critical threshold below which physiological systems begin to downregulate in most athletes?",

                "20 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that energy availability below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is associated with significant impairments in metabolic rate, bone health, and reproductive function."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in Master Athletes (age 60+), what is the evidence-based recommendation for per-meal protein intake to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",

                "1.2g/kg body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Master athletes require a higher per-meal dose of protein (approximately 0.4g/kg) compared to younger athletes (0.25g/kg) to achieve the same stimulation of MPS due to age-related anabolic resistance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because non-heme iron from plant sources has lower bioavailability than heme iron, the Institute of Medicine recommends that vegetarians consume 1.8 times the standard RDA."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "For a Para-athlete with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) at the T6 level or higher, which physiological factor most complicates hydration and temperature regulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Athletes with SCI above T6 often have an impaired sympathetic nervous system response, leading to an inability to sweat below the level of the injury, significantly increasing the risk of hyperthermia."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In weight-class sports, what is the maximum recommended rate of weekly body mass loss to minimize the loss of Lean Body Mass (LBM) and metabolic slowing?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses after exercise/dehydration, athletes should consume 1.5L of fluid for every 1kg of body mass lost during the 'making weight' process."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adolescence is a critical window for bone mineral density accretion; calcium requirements are at their highest (approx. 1,300mg/day) to support this rapid skeletal growth."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S is characterized by low energy availability which leads to metabolic down-regulation (low T3), cardiovascular changes (bradycardia), and impaired bone health (stress fractures)."

                "Caffeine",
                "Beta-Alanine",
                "Creatine Monohydrate",
                "Sodium Bicarbonate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vegetarians typically have lower baseline muscle creatine stores because the primary dietary sources of creatine are meat and fish; therefore, they often see a more pronounced response to supplementation."
