            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Periodize Nutrition' pillar focuses on matching nutrition to training cycles. 'Train Low' involves deliberate training with low carbohydrate availability to trigger adaptive responses like increased fat oxidation and mitochondrial enzyme activity, while 'Compete High' ensures glycogen stores are saturated for performance."
