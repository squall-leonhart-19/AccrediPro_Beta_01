            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "During prolonged exercise in the heat, a decrease in plasma volume leads to 'Cardiovascular Drift.' What is the primary physiological manifestation of this phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in heart rate to preserve cardiac output",
                "A gradual increase in heart rate to compensate for decreased stroke volume",
                "An increase in stroke volume to compensate for peripheral vasodilation",
                "A decrease in core temperature due to increased sweat efficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cardiovascular drift is characterized by a progressive increase in heart rate during steady-state exercise, particularly in the heat, to compensate for the reduction in stroke volume caused by fluid loss and increased skin blood flow."

            "question": "An athlete weighs 80 kg before a 90-minute training session and 78.2 kg after. During the session, they consumed 750 ml of water and did not void their bladder. What is their hourly sweat rate?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 L/hr",
                "1.5 L/hr",
                "1.7 L/hr",
                "2.1 L/hr"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Total fluid loss = (Pre-weight - Post-weight) + Intake. (80kg - 78.2kg) = 1.8kg (1800ml). 1800ml + 750ml = 2550ml total loss. 2550ml / 1.5 hours = 1700ml/hr or 1.7 L/hr."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Which electrolyte is the primary cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and is responsible for maintaining osmotic pressure and fluid distribution?",
            "options": [
                "Potassium",
                "Magnesium",
                "Calcium",
                "Sodium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sodium is the primary extracellular cation. It plays a critical role in maintaining ECF volume, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle contraction, and is the most significant electrolyte lost in sweat."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia (EAH) is primarily caused by which of the following scenarios?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive sodium intake during a marathon",
                "Consumption of water in excess of sweat and urinary losses",
                "Severe dehydration resulting in a 5% body mass loss",
                "High-intensity sprinting in cold environments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EAH is typically a dilutional hyponatremia (serum sodium <135 mmol/L) caused by overconsumption of hypotonic fluids (water or low-sodium sports drinks) beyond the body's ability to excrete the excess fluid."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "To optimize gastric emptying and intestinal absorption during high-intensity endurance events, what is the generally recommended carbohydrate concentration for a sports beverage?",
            "options": [
                "2-4%",
                "6-8%",
                "10-12%",
                "15-20%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A carbohydrate concentration of 6-8% (isotonic or slightly hypotonic) is ideal. Concentrations above 8% (hypertonic) significantly slow gastric emptying and can lead to gastrointestinal distress."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "At high altitudes (>2,500m), why do hydration requirements typically increase for athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Decreased metabolic rate reduces thirst signals",
                "Increased humidity reduces the need for sweating",
                "Increased respiratory water loss and cold-induced diuresis",
                "Enhanced glycogen storage requires more intracellular water"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High altitude increases fluid loss through increased respiratory rate (dry air) and 'altitude diuresis,' where the kidneys excrete more water to concentrate the blood and improve oxygen delivery."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A USG value of >1.020 is generally considered indicative of dehydration. Values between 1.000 and 1.010 indicate well-hydrated status."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the case study of an Ironman competitor, why is the inclusion of sodium in the rehydration protocol essential for restoring plasma volume?",
            "options": [
                "It stimulates the release of insulin to drive glucose into cells",
                "It maintains the osmotic drive to drink and reduces premature urine production",
                "It prevents the kidneys from filtering blood too quickly",
                "It increases the core temperature to match the environment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sodium maintains the osmotic pressure of the blood, which keeps the thirst mechanism active and suppresses the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) less than plain water, preventing excessive urination."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism of heat dissipation in a hot, dry environment where the ambient temperature exceeds skin temperature?",
            "options": [
                "Conduction",
                "Convection",
                "Radiation",
                "Evaporation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "When ambient temperature exceeds skin temperature, evaporation of sweat is the only effective means of heat loss. Conduction, convection, and radiation may actually result in heat gain."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "For a 'salty sweater' losing 1,500mg of sodium per liter of sweat, what is the most appropriate intervention during a 4-hour endurance event?",
            "options": [
                "Stick to plain water to avoid GI distress",
                "Consume 200-300mg of sodium per hour regardless of sweat rate",
                "Target a sodium replacement of 500-1,000mg per hour based on fluid intake",
                "Avoid all salt until the post-exercise recovery meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heavy/salty sweaters require higher sodium replacement (often 500-1,000mg+ per hour) to maintain serum sodium levels and plasma volume during prolonged exercise."
