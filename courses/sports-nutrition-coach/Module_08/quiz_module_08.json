            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "In the neurobiology of performance, which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for the 'mental drive' and reward-seeking behavior necessary for high-intensity training sessions?",
            "options": ["GABA", "Serotonin", "Dopamine", "Melatonin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter associated with motivation, reward, and the 'drive' to perform. It plays a critical role in the prefrontal cortex for executive function during competition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2 on Cognitive Fueling, what is the primary benefit of Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) for an athlete's brain during a glycogen-depleted state?",
            "options": ["It increases muscle glycogen synthesis", "It serves as a more oxygen-efficient fuel source for neurons than glucose", "It blocks the production of cortisol", "It increases the heart rate to improve circulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ketones like BHB provide more energy per unit of oxygen compared to glucose and can cross the blood-brain barrier to provide up to 70% of the brain's energy needs during carbohydrate restriction."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "The Gut-Brain Axis relies on 'Short-Chain Fatty Acids' (SCFAs) produced by the microbiome. Which SCFA is specifically noted for its ability to strengthen the blood-brain barrier and reduce neuroinflammation?",
            "options": ["Acetate", "Propionate", "Butyrate", "Lactate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a critical SCFA that helps maintain the integrity of both the gut lining and the blood-brain barrier, exerting significant anti-inflammatory effects on the central nervous system."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "In a 2012 study on Ashwagandha (KSM-66) cited in Lesson 4, what was the approximate percentage reduction in serum cortisol levels observed in participants after 60 days of supplementation?",
            "options": ["10-12%", "27-30%", "45-50%", "5-8%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study showed that 600mg of high-concentration Ashwagandha extract led to an average 27.9% reduction in serum cortisol levels, significantly improving stress resistance."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "To facilitate the transport of Tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier for melatonin production, what nutritional strategy should be employed in the evening?",
            "options": ["Consuming a high-fat meal with no carbs", "Consuming protein with a small amount of high-glycemic carbohydrates", "Fasting for 4 hours before bed", "High-dose caffeine intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin secretion from carbohydrates helps clear Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs) from the blood, allowing Tryptophan to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively via the LAT1 transporter."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered a key indicator of the 'T:C Ratio,' used to determine if an athlete is in an overreached or catabolic state?",
            "options": ["The ratio of Total Testosterone to Cortisol", "The ratio of Sodium to Potassium", "The ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol", "The ratio of Glucose to Ketones"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Testosterone to Cortisol (T:C) ratio is a standard metric in sports science to assess the balance between anabolic and catabolic states; a drop of >30% often indicates overtraining."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In the PERFORM Method™, what does the 'O' stand for, and how does it relate to the iterative coaching loop?",
            "options": ["Oxygenation; focusing on VO2 max", "Objective Data; using biomarkers and metrics to guide adjustments", "Overload; ensuring the athlete is always lifting heavier", "Outcome; focusing only on the final competition result"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in PERFORM stands for Objective Data. This involves tracking biomarkers, body composition, and performance metrics to make data-driven, iterative adjustments to the nutrition plan."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog' and mental fatigue during the final 20 minutes of their 90-minute soccer match. Based on Lesson 2, which intervention is most likely to resolve this specific cognitive dip?",
            "options": ["Increasing protein intake at breakfast", "Intra-workout carbohydrate rinsing or ingestion (30-60g/hr)", "Reducing total calorie intake", "Taking a melatonin supplement 30 minutes before the game"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mental fatigue in long-duration sports is often a result of central nervous system glucose depletion. Intra-workout carbohydrates maintain blood glucose levels and support cognitive function in the 'clutch' moments of a match."

        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "When using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a tracking metric, a significant and sustained 'drop' in the RMSSD value typically indicates:",
            "options": ["Improved cardiovascular fitness", "Increased Parasympathetic dominance", "Accumulated systemic stress and poor recovery", "High levels of gut microbiome diversity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is a primary HRV metric. A decrease indicates a shift toward Sympathetic (fight or flight) dominance, signaling that the athlete is not recovering well from the current training load."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "In the final Case Study Synthesis (Lesson 8), which factor is prioritized first when an athlete shows signs of both metabolic adaptation and high psychological stress?",
            "options": ["Increasing training volume immediately", "Aggressive caloric restriction", "Regulating the HPA axis through micronutrient support and sleep hygiene", "Removing all carbohydrates from the diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PERFORM Method™ emphasizes that you cannot layer high-intensity performance on a broken foundation. Regulating the HPA axis and cortisol is essential before further metabolic or physical demands are placed on the athlete."
