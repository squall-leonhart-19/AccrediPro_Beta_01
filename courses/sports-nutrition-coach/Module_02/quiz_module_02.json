            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCr stores are limited and deplete rapidly during maximal exertion; research shows a 50-70% reduction within the first 5-8 seconds of high-intensity work."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In intermittent team sports like soccer, what is the primary role of the aerobic (oxidative) system during low-intensity walking or standing periods?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The aerobic system is critical for recovery in intermittent sports as it provides the oxygen necessary to re-phosphorylate creatine into PCr during rest intervals."
