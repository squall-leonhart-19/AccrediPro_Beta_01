            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ATP-PCr system provides immediate energy but is limited by the small stores of PCr in the muscle, which typically begin to exhaust after 6-10 seconds of maximal effort."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "When utilizing fast glycolysis to fuel high-intensity exercise, what is the net ATP yield if the process begins with muscle glycogen rather than blood glucose?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycogenolysis bypasses the first ATP-consuming step of glycolysis (hexokinase reaction), resulting in a net yield of 3 ATP compared to 2 ATP from blood glucose."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The crossover point typically occurs around 65% of VO2 max, where the relative contribution of carbohydrate exceeds that of lipids due to recruitment of Type II fibers and glycolytic flux."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MCTs are essential for the 'Lactate Shuttle,' moving lactate out of producing cells (MCT4) and into consuming cells (MCT1) for fuel or processing."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PCr resynthesis is an oxygen-dependent process. A robust aerobic system allows for faster recovery of the immediate energy system between repeated high-intensity efforts."
