            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "According to the 'Muscle Full Effect' discussed in Lesson 1, what is the typical duration of the refractory period during which Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) cannot be re-stimulated, regardless of further protein intake?",
            "options": [
                "30 to 60 minutes",
                "3 to 5 hours",
                "8 to 12 hours",
                "24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that after a protein-rich meal, MPS remains elevated for approximately 2-3 hours before returning to baseline. During this 'refractory period' (typically lasting 3-5 hours total from the start of the meal), the muscle is insensitive to further amino acid stimulation."

            "question": "Why is the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) considered superior to the Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)?",
            "options": [
                "DIAAS measures nitrogen balance rather than amino acid profiles.",
                "PDCAAS overestimates the quality of animal proteins while ignoring anti-nutritional factors.",
                "DIAAS utilizes ileal digestibility of individual amino acids rather than fecal digestibility of the whole protein.",
                "DIAAS is specifically designed for sedentary populations, whereas PDCAAS is for athletes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DIAAS is more accurate because it measures the digestibility of each individual essential amino acid at the end of the small intestine (ileum), whereas PDCAAS uses fecal digestibility, which can be skewed by large intestinal bacteria."

            "question": "A 100kg elite rugby player in a hypertrophy phase requires approximately 2.0g/kg/day of protein. To optimize the 'Leucine Trigger' at each meal, what is the most effective distribution strategy?",
            "options": [
                "200g of protein consumed in a single post-workout meal.",
                "50g of protein distributed across 4 meals every 3-4 hours.",
                "20g of protein distributed across 10 small snacks throughout the day.",
                "150g at breakfast and 50g at dinner."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maximize MPS, protein should be distributed into 'bolus' doses (approx. 0.4-0.5g/kg per meal) to ensure the leucine threshold (approx. 2.5-3g) is reached in each feeding, spaced out to respect the refractory period."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which amino acid acts as the primary 'nutrient sensor' and potent activator of the mTORC1 pathway?",
            "options": [
                "L-Glutamine",
                "L-Arginine",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leucine is the primary branched-chain amino acid responsible for signaling the mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) pathway, which initiates the translation process of muscle protein synthesis."

                "0.8 g/kg (56g/day)",
                "1.2 to 1.4 g/kg (84-98g/day)",
                "2.2 to 3.0 g/kg (154-210g/day)",
                "Endurance athletes do not require protein; they only require carbohydrates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While strength athletes require more protein for hypertrophy, endurance athletes still require 1.2-1.4 g/kg to repair muscle damage and support the synthesis of oxidative enzymes and mitochondrial proteins."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Plant-based athletes often struggle with 'limiting amino acids.' Which amino acid is typically deficient in cereal grains like rice and wheat?",
            "options": [

                "Leucine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cereal grains are generally low in Lysine, while legumes (beans/lentils) are generally low in Methionine. Combining these sources ensures a complete amino acid profile."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "What is the 'Thermic Effect of Food' (TEF) percentage typically associated with protein consumption, and how does it compare to fats and carbohydrates?",
            "options": [
                "0-3%; lower than fats.",
                "5-10%; equal to carbohydrates.",

                "50%; the highest of all macronutrients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has a high TEF (20-30%), meaning a significant portion of the calories consumed from protein is burned during the digestion and processing of the nutrient, which aids in weight management and satiety."

            "question": "Based on the 2023 meta-analyses discussed in Lesson 7, what is the impact of a high-protein diet (up to 3.3g/kg) on renal function in healthy, resistance-trained individuals?",
            "options": [
                "It causes acute kidney injury within 12 weeks.",
                "It significantly decreases Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).",
                "There is no evidence of deleterious effects on kidney or liver function in healthy individuals.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term studies on resistance-trained individuals consuming high-protein diets (up to 3.3g/kg/day) have shown no adverse effects on renal or hepatic biomarkers, provided there is no pre-existing kidney disease."

            "question": "In the context of 'Anabolic Resistance' in older athletes (Masters athletes), how should protein recommendations change compared to younger athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Protein should be decreased to prevent kidney strain.",
                "Per-meal protein doses should be increased (e.g., 0.6g/kg) to overcome a higher leucine threshold.",
                "Protein should be replaced with simple carbohydrates.",
                "There is no difference in requirements."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Older adults exhibit anabolic resistance, meaning they require a higher concentration of leucine (and thus more total protein per meal) to trigger the same MPS response as a younger individual."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When considering protein timing for hypertrophy, which of the following is most critical for long-term results?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming protein within exactly 15 minutes of finishing a workout.",
                "Consuming only BCAAs during the workout.",
                "Total daily protein intake and consistent distribution across the day.",
                "Avoiding protein before sleep to maximize Growth Hormone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the 'anabolic window' exists, total daily protein intake and regular distribution (every 3-5 hours) are the most significant factors for hypertrophy, far outweighing the importance of immediate post-workout timing."
