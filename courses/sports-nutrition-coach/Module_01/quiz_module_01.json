            "question": "A track athlete performs a maximal effort 60-meter dash lasting approximately 7 seconds. Which energy system is the primary contributor to ATP resynthesis during this bout?",
            "options": [
                "The Phosphagen (ATP-PC) System",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The ATP-PC system is the primary energy provider for high-intensity activities lasting less than 10-12 seconds, utilizing stored phosphocreatine for immediate ATP regeneration."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the context of Metabolic Rate assessment, which component of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is most variable and accounts for the largest difference in caloric needs between a sedentary individual and an elite athlete?",
            "options": [
                "Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)",
                "Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)",
                "Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)",
                "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While RMR is the largest component of TDEE for most people, EAT (the energy expended during planned exercise) is the most variable and can range from 0 kcal to over 3,000 kcal in elite endurance athletes."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "During prolonged endurance exercise (>90 minutes), the body increases secretion of cortisol. What is the primary metabolic purpose of this endocrine response in a fasted or glycogen-depleted state?",
            "options": [
                "To increase glycogen synthesis in the liver",
                "To promote gluconeogenesis and mobilize free fatty acids",
                "To stimulate muscle protein synthesis",
                "To decrease the rate of lipolysis to preserve fat stores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a catabolic hormone that facilitates the mobilization of fuel by promoting lipolysis and the breakdown of amino acids for gluconeogenesis when carbohydrate availability is low."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "To maximize carbohydrate absorption during high-intensity competition, sports nutritionists often recommend a mix of glucose and fructose. Which transporter is responsible for the facilitated diffusion of fructose across the apical membrane?",

                "Na+/K+ ATPase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucose uses the SGLT1 transporter (sodium-dependent), while fructose uses the GLUT5 transporter. Utilizing both pathways prevents saturation of a single transporter, increasing total carbohydrate oxidation rates."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which muscle fiber type is characterized by a high mitochondrial density, high myoglobin content, and a high resistance to fatigue, making it the dominant fiber used during a marathon?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Type I (slow-twitch) fibers are oxidative, meaning they rely on oxygen to produce ATP, are rich in mitochondria, and are built for endurance and fatigue resistance."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "The 'Crossover Point' refers to the intensity where the body shifts from utilizing primarily fats to primarily carbohydrates. At what approximate intensity does this typically occur in a moderately trained individual?",
            "options": [
                "35-40% of VO2 max",
                "60-65% of VO2 max",

                "95-100% of VO2 max"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In most moderately trained individuals, the crossover point occurs around 60-65% of VO2 max. Training can shift this point to the right, allowing for greater fat oxidation at higher intensities."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "According to the principles of Allostasis, what does the term 'Allostatic Load' represent in an athlete?",

                "The maximum amount of glycogen the liver can store"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load is the cumulative cost to the body of adapting to chronic stressors (training, work, lack of sleep), which can eventually lead to overtraining or injury if not managed."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "During a physiological intake, a client presents with a sudden 15% drop in performance, disrupted sleep, and a suppressed resting heart rate variability (HRV). These symptoms are clinical 'red flags' for which condition?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Significant performance drops combined with autonomic nervous system dysfunction (evidenced by HRV changes) and sleep disturbances indicate non-functional overreaching or the onset of Overtraining Syndrome."

                "0-10 kcal",
                "20-30 kcal",

                "200-250 kcal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protein has a TEF of roughly 20-30%. Since 100g of protein is 400 kcal, the energy required for its digestion and processing would be 80-120 kcal (400 * 0.20 to 0.30)."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client is performing a 'Zone 2' cardiovascular workout. Which metabolic pathway is providing the vast majority of the ATP required for this low-to-moderate intensity, steady-state activity?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training is primarily aerobic and fueled by the oxidative system. Beta-oxidation breaks down fatty acids to enter the TCA (Krebs) cycle for efficient ATP production."
