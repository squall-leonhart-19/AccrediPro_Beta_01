            "question": "According to the foundations of nutritional periodization, what is the primary physiological objective of 'Train Low' (low carbohydrate availability) strategies during a base-building microcycle?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize immediate glycolytic power for high-intensity intervals",
                "To enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulate fatty acid oxidation",
                "To ensure maximum glycogen supercompensation before a competition",
                "To minimize the risk of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Train Low' strategy is designed to create a metabolic stressor that signals the body to increase mitochondrial density and improve its ability to utilize fat as a fuel source, though it is typically reserved for low-to-moderate intensity sessions."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When planning a Macrocycle for an endurance athlete with a primary race in 6 months, which phase should focus on establishing a 'metabolic base' and potentially address body composition goals?",
            "options": [
                "The Competitive Phase",
                "The Taper Phase",
                "The Preparatory (Off-Season) Phase",
                "The Peaking Phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Preparatory or Off-Season phase is the ideal time for foundational work, including body composition adjustments and metabolic flexibility training, as the training intensity is lower and the risk of performance interference is reduced."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "During a Hypertrophy Mesocycle, what is the recommended protein intake range to support muscle protein synthesis (MPS) while in a caloric surplus?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 - 1.2 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.4 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.6 - 2.2 g/kg of body weight",
                "3.5 - 4.5 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg of body weight is the optimal range for maximizing MPS in athletes undergoing resistance training, especially when energy intake is sufficient."

            "question": "In a Microcycle featuring 'Two-a-Day' training sessions, what is the 'Gold Standard' recommendation for carbohydrate intake between sessions to ensure rapid glycogen resynthesis?",
            "options": [
                "0.5g/kg per hour for the first 4 hours",
                "1.0 - 1.2g/kg per hour for the first 4 hours",
                "A single bolus of 50g of fructose immediately after the first session",
                "Restricting carbohydrates to enhance the 'Train Low' effect for the second session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maximize the rate of glycogen resynthesis when the recovery window is short (<8 hours), athletes should consume 1.0-1.2g/kg of high-GI carbohydrates per hour for the first 4 hours post-exercise."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based protocols for glycogen supercompensation suggest an intake of 10-12g of carbohydrate per kg of body weight per 24 hours in the 36-48 hours before the event."

            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM)",

                "15 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An Energy Availability (EA) below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) is widely recognized as the threshold where hormonal disruptions and clinical symptoms of RED-S begin to manifest."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Which physiological adaptation is the primary goal of 'Gut Training' (nutritional periodization for the GI tract)?",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing the rate of gastric emptying to prevent hunger",
                "Upregulating SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters to increase carbohydrate absorption capacity",

                "Reducing the volume of the stomach to assist with weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut training aims to increase the number and activity of sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLT1) and fructose transporters (GLUT5), allowing for higher exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates (up to 90-120g/hr) with less GI distress."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "During a Power/Peaking Mesocycle, why might a coach shift the focus from a caloric surplus to 'isocaloric' or maintenance energy intake?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize fat gain before the competitive season",
                "To ensure the athlete is in a fasted state for every workout",
                "To optimize the power-to-weight ratio by maintaining lean mass while minimizing unnecessary non-functional mass",
                "Because power training requires significantly less total energy than hypertrophy training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the Power phase, the goal is often to translate strength into speed/explosiveness. Maintaining a stable weight ensures a high power-to-weight ratio, which is critical for performance in many sports."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "When adjusting a periodized plan for a 'Deload Week' (reduced volume and intensity), how should the nutritional plan generally be modified?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain the same high-carbohydrate intake to ensure maximum recovery",
                "Increase caloric intake by 20% to repair micro-tears",
                "Decrease total energy intake, primarily by reducing carbohydrate amounts to match the lower expenditure",
                "Transition to a ketogenic diet for the duration of the week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Since training volume is significantly reduced during a deload, energy requirements drop. Adjusting carbohydrates downward prevents unwanted fat gain while still providing enough energy for recovery."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "An athlete is attempting to increase the oxidation of 'multiple transportable carbohydrates.' What is the recommended ratio of Glucose to Fructose to maximize absorption?",

                "1:1 ratio only",
                "2:1 ratio of Glucose (or Maltodextrin) to Fructose",
                "4:1 ratio of Fructose to Glucose",
                "Glucose only; Fructose should be avoided due to GI distress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 2:1 ratio of glucose (which uses SGLT1) to fructose (which uses GLUT5) allows for higher total carbohydrate absorption rates than glucose alone, as it utilizes two different transport pathways."
