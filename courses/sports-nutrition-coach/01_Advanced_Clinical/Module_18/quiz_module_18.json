            "options": ["Energy (E)", "Optimization (O)", "Resilience (R)", "Mindset (M)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "When synthesizing Advanced Periodization (L2), which nutritional adjustment is most critical during the 'Competition/Peaking' phase compared to the 'Base' phase?",
            "options": ["Increasing protein to 3.0g/kg to prevent muscle loss", "Prioritizing high carbohydrate availability and nervous system recovery", "Focusing on metabolic flexibility through chronic fat adaptation", "Reducing total caloric intake to achieve minimum body fat"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the peaking phase, the focus shifts from metabolic adaptations to performance execution, requiring high carbohydrate availability (glycogen saturation) and supporting the CNS for maximal output."
        },
        {
            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "An athlete's metabolic profile shows a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.85 during moderate-intensity exercise. What does this value indicate regarding substrate utilization?",
            "options": ["The athlete is burning 100% fat", "The athlete is burning 100% carbohydrates", "The athlete is utilizing a roughly equal mix of fats and carbohydrates", "The athlete is in a state of metabolic ketoacidosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 reflects pure fat oxidation, 1.0 reflects pure carbohydrate oxidation, and 0.85 represents a mixed fuel utilization typical of moderate intensity."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "In the Neuro-Nutritional Axis (L4), which amino acid ratio is most influential in determining the transport of Tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier for serotonin synthesis?",
            "options": ["Tryptophan to Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAA)", "Tryptophan to Tyrosine", "Leucine to Glutamine", "Arginine to Lysine"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan competes with Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs) for the same transport carrier. A higher Tryptophan:LNAA ratio (often achieved via insulin-induced LNAA uptake into muscle) facilitates serotonin production."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "When synthesizing environmental variables (L5) for an athlete training at high altitude, why must the coach increase the focus on iron status (Ferritin)?",
            "options": ["Altitude causes rapid iron excretion through sweat", "Hypoxia triggers erythropoiesis, increasing the demand for iron to form hemoglobin", "Iron prevents the development of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)", "Altitude decreases the absorption rate of non-heme iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Altitude-induced hypoxia stimulates the production of Erythropoietin (EPO), which drives the production of new red blood cells, significantly increasing the biological demand for iron."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "A Data-Driven Decision (L6) shows a 3-day trend of 'Decreased HRV' and 'Increased Resting Heart Rate' despite a scheduled rest day. What is the most likely synthesis of this data?",
            "options": ["The athlete is experiencing optimal supercompensation", "The athlete is showing early signs of sympathetic overreaching", "The athlete's metabolic flexibility is improving", "The athlete needs to increase their caffeine intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of suppressed Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and elevated Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is a classic physiological marker of autonomic nervous system stress and sympathetic overreaching."

        {
            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "According to the System Failure Synthesis (L7), an athlete presenting with low energy availability, recurring stress fractures, and suppressed T3 levels is likely suffering from:",
            "options": ["Overtraining Syndrome (OTS) only", "Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)", "Acute Glycogen Depletion", "Metabolic Syndrome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S is characterized by a multi-system failure including hormonal disruption (low T3), impaired bone health (stress fractures), and energy deficiency."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "In the Performance Blueprint (L8), what is the primary purpose of the 'Iterative Feedback Loop'?",
            "options": ["To justify the cost of the coaching program", "To ensure the athlete follows the plan without deviation", "To adjust the nutrition protocol based on subjective RPE and objective biomarkers", "To replace the need for initial baseline testing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The iterative loop allows the coach to synthesize real-world results and athlete feedback to refine the 'Blueprint' for better precision over time."

            "options": ["1-2%", "5-8%", "15-20%", "No significant difference"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The synthesis of periodized nutrition typically yields a 5-8% improvement in performance metrics by aligning fuel availability with specific training intensities."

            "options": ["L-Theanine and Magnesium", "L-Tyrosine as a precursor to Dopamine/Norepinephrine", "Glycine for CNS inhibition", "GABA for relaxation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Tyrosine is the precursor for catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine). Under acute stress, Tyrosine supplementation can help maintain cognitive performance and focus by preventing neurotransmitter depletion."
