            "question": "In a Double-Peak macro-periodization cycle for an elite swimmer, what is the primary physiological objective of the 'Transition/Maintenance' phase between the first and second competitive peaks?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize hypertrophy to prevent muscle wasting during the second peak",
                "To facilitate neurological recovery while maintaining mitochondrial density and enzymatic pathways",
                "To induce a 40% reduction in caloric intake to improve power-to-weight ratio",
                "To completely cease all sport-specific activity to allow for total systemic inflammation resolution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The transition phase in multi-peak cycles is designed to prevent 'burnout' and overtraining by allowing neurological recovery while using 'maintenance' loads to preserve the physiological adaptations (like mitochondrial density) gained during the first build."

            "question": "An athlete's metabolic flexibility is assessed via Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER). During a fasted, low-intensity (45% VO2 Max) recovery run, an RER of 0.72 indicates which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete is almost exclusively utilizing glucose as a fuel source",
                "The athlete has poor metabolic flexibility and is struggling to oxidize fatty acids",
                "The athlete is demonstrating high lipid oxidation efficiency, typical of a metabolically flexible state",
                "The athlete is in a state of metabolic acidosis and should cease exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 to 0.75 indicates high fat oxidation. A metabolically flexible athlete can efficiently switch to fat oxidation during low-intensity work, sparing glycogen for higher intensities."

            "question": "Chrono-nutrition research suggests that the thermic effect of food (TEF) and insulin sensitivity follow a circadian rhythm. What is the clinical implication for an athlete's evening meal?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin sensitivity is highest at 10:00 PM, making it the ideal time for high-GI recovery shakes",
                "Melatonin secretion can impair glucose tolerance, suggesting large carbohydrate boluses should be consumed earlier in the day",
                "Protein synthesis is inhibited after 8:00 PM regardless of total daily protein intake",
                "Fat oxidation is 50% higher during the biological night, favoring high-fat late-night snacks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin has an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion. Consuming large amounts of high-glycemic carbohydrates late at night when melatonin is rising can lead to prolonged hyperglycemia and disrupted sleep quality."

            "question": "A nutrigenomic profile reveals a client has the 'CC' genotype (slow metabolizer) for the CYP1A2 gene. What is the evidence-based recommendation for their caffeine use during a 40km cycling time trial?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caffeine dose to 9mg/kg to overcome the slow metabolism",
                "Caffeine may be ergolytic (decrease performance) or provide no benefit; use with extreme caution or avoid",
                "Caffeine will stay in their system longer, providing a significant competitive advantage over fast metabolizers",
                "The genotype only affects caffeine's impact on bone density, not athletic performance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Guest et al., 2018) have shown that 'slow metabolizers' (CC genotype) may actually see a decrease in performance with caffeine supplementation, whereas 'fast metabolizers' (AA genotype) see significant improvements."

            "options": [
                "5.0 g/kg body mass of glycerol with 50ml/kg of water",
                "0.1 g/kg body mass of glycerol with 5ml/kg of water",
                "1.2–1.5 g/kg body mass of glycerol with 25–35 ml/kg of water",
                "Glycerol is no longer used as it has been proven to decrease plasma volume"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The standard protocol for glycerol-induced hyper-hydration is 1.2–1.5 g/kg of body mass, consumed with a significant volume of fluid (25-35 ml/kg) approximately 60-90 minutes before exercise in the heat."

            "question": "When using the 4-Compartment (4C) model for body composition analysis, which four variables are being measured or estimated to determine fat mass?",
            "options": [
                "Total Body Water, Bone Mineral Content, Body Density, and Body Mass",
                "Subcutaneous Fat, Visceral Fat, Intramuscular Fat, and Essential Fat",
                "Height, Weight, Age, and Biological Sex",
                "Grip Strength, VO2 Max, Body Mass Index, and Waist Circumference"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 4C model is the gold standard because it accounts for individual variations in water (TBW) and bone (BMC) rather than assuming constant values for fat-free mass density, as 2C or 3C models do."

            "question": "The 'Gut-Brain-Muscle Axis' suggests that certain nootropics may reduce central fatigue. What is the proposed mechanism of action for Alpha-GPC in a performance context?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the availability of acetylcholine, potentially enhancing power output and cognitive focus",
                "It directly inhibits the production of lactic acid in the muscle fibers",
                "It acts as a mechanical buffer for intramuscular pH changes",
                "It prevents the absorption of all dietary fats to ensure rapid weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Alpha-GPC is a cholinergic compound that increases acetylcholine levels in the brain, which is linked to improved cognitive function and potentially increased growth hormone secretion and power output."

                "Eating a single large meal once per day regardless of training load",
                "Implementing 'Sleep Extension' (9+ hours) during heavy loading blocks to improve reaction time and mood",
                "Using high-dose Vitamin C (2000mg+) immediately post-exercise to permanently blunt adaptive signaling",
                "Ignoring heart rate variability (HRV) data in favor of a rigid, pre-planned schedule"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recovery Architecture involves the strategic use of sleep, nutrition, and modality timing. Sleep extension has been shown in various studies (e.g., Mah et al., 2011) to significantly improve athletic performance metrics."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis on electrolyte profiling found that athletes losing >1.5g of Sodium (Na+) per liter of sweat experienced what average decline in aerobic capacity when replacing <50% of losses in high-heat environments?",
            "options": [
                "No decline was observed as sodium is not related to aerobic capacity",
                "A marginal 1-2% decline in power output",
                "A significant 7-10% decline in time-to-exhaustion and power output",
                "An immediate 25% increase in muscle hypertrophy due to cellular swelling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High sodium loss (salty sweating) without adequate replacement leads to a more rapid decline in plasma volume, increasing cardiovascular strain and reducing performance by approximately 7-10% in endurance tasks."

            "question": "Which personalized ergogenic protocol is most appropriate for an athlete with a 'Low Responder' profile to beta-alanine (minimal increase in muscle carnosine)?",
            "options": [
                "Stop all supplementation as it is impossible to increase carnosine in this individual",
                "Utilize a longer loading phase (10-12 weeks) at a consistent dose of 6.4g/day to reach saturation",
                "Switch to high-dose sodium bicarbonate 5 minutes before the race as the only alternative",
                "Double the dose to 20g/day for 3 days to force immediate saturation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 'low responders' simply take longer to reach muscle carnosine saturation. Extending the loading phase rather than increasing the daily dose (which may cause paresthesia) is the recommended advanced strategy."
