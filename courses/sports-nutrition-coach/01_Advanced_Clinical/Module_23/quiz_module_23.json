            "question": "In a double-peak macro-periodization cycle, what is the primary objective of the 'inter-peak maintenance' phase occurring between two major competitions?",
            "options": [
                "Complete physiological detraining to reset hormonal sensitivity",
                "Sustaining peak adaptations while strategically managing systemic fatigue and 'decay' of performance markers",
                "Aggressive caloric surplus to maximize muscle cross-sectional area",
                "Increasing training volume to its highest annual point to force overreaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The inter-peak phase focuses on maintaining the adaptations gained during the first peak while shedding fatigue to allow for a second peak, rather than starting a full preparatory cycle over."

            "question": "An athlete with high metabolic flexibility demonstrates a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) closest to which value during low-intensity, fasted aerobic exercise?",
            "options": [
                "0.70",
                "0.85",
                "1.00",
                "1.15"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates primary reliance on lipid (fat) oxidation, a hallmark of metabolic flexibility during low-intensity or fasted states."

            "question": "According to chrono-nutrition principles, why is it advantageous to consume the majority of daily carbohydrates during the 'biological morning'?",
            "options": [
                "It suppresses melatonin production for the next 24 hours",
                "Muscle protein synthesis is only active before 12:00 PM",
                "Post-prandial glucose clearance is typically optimized in the morning due to higher insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 translocation efficiency",
                "It prevents the 'afternoon slump' by permanently elevating cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circadian rhythms dictate that insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance are generally higher in the early active phase (biological morning) compared to the evening."

            "question": "An athlete possessing the CC genotype of the CYP1A2 gene is classified as a 'slow metabolizer' of caffeine. Based on nutrigenomic research, what is the recommended protocol?",
            "options": [
                "They should consume 9mg/kg of caffeine 15 minutes before exercise",
                "Caffeine may be ergolytic (performance-hindering) or provide no benefit if taken too close to competition",
                "They should only use caffeine in the evening to improve sleep quality",
                "Genetics have no impact on caffeine metabolism or performance outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Guest et al., 2018) indicates that slow metabolizers (CC genotype) may see decreased performance or no benefit from caffeine, whereas fast metabolizers (AA) see significant gains."

            "options": [
                "0.1g/kg body weight with 5mL/kg of fluid",
                "1.0–1.5g/kg body weight with 25–35mL/kg of fluid",
                "5.0g/kg body weight with no additional fluid",
                "10g total regardless of the athlete's body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective glycerol hyper-hydration requires approximately 1.0-1.5g per kg of body weight paired with a significant volume of fluid to create an osmotic drive for water retention."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "Why is the 4-Component (4C) model considered superior to a standard DXA scan for elite body composition modeling?",
            "options": [
                "It is a single-step process that takes less than 5 minutes",
                "DXA cannot distinguish between intracellular and extracellular water, whereas the 4C model accounts for total body water, bone mineral, and body volume",
                "The 4C model is based purely on visual assessment and is more subjective",
                "DXA scans are 100% accurate and the 4C model is an outdated alternative"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4C model is the 'Gold Standard' because it integrates multiple measures (hydrostatic weighing/BodPod, DXA, and Bio-impedance/Deuterium dilution) to account for variations in hydration and bone density."

            "question": "Which nootropic agent is specifically utilized in the 'Gut-Brain-Muscle Axis' framework to reduce caffeine-induced jitters while enhancing alpha-wave activity for 'calm focus'?",
            "options": [
                "Creatine Monohydrate",

                "Sodium Bicarbonate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Theanine, often paired with caffeine in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio, promotes relaxation without sedation and mitigates the peripheral stimulant side effects of caffeine."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "In the PERFORM Synthesis framework, the 'R' stands for 'Recovery & Regeneration.' Which metric is most commonly used to validate the success of this pillar?",
            "options": [
                "Daily step count",
                "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) trends and resting heart rate (RHR) stability",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV is a primary objective marker for autonomic nervous system balance and systemic recovery within advanced performance systems."

            "question": "In the context of substrate utilization, what does 'shifting the crossover point to the right' signify?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete begins using carbohydrates at a lower heart rate than before",
                "The athlete can maintain fat oxidation at higher relative exercise intensities (e.g., 65-70% VO2 max vs 50%)",
                "The athlete has become less efficient at using oxygen",
                "The athlete is reaching muscular failure faster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shifting the crossover point to the right means the athlete is more metabolically efficient, sparing glycogen by utilizing fat at higher power outputs."

            "question": "Case Study: A marathoner is identified as a 'salty sweater' losing 1,500mg of sodium per liter of sweat. In a 3-hour race with 3 liters of total sweat loss, what is the Precision Hydration recommendation?",
            "options": [
                "Drink only plain water to avoid electrolyte toxicity",
                "Replace 100% of fluid loss but 0% of sodium loss",
                "Targeted sodium replacement of 70-100% of lost sodium (approx. 3,150–4,500mg) via high-concentration electrolyte solutions",
                "Consume 500mg of sodium total regardless of sweat concentration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Precision hydration requires matching sodium replacement to the athlete's specific sweat profile; for a 'salty sweater,' standard sports drinks (approx. 400-500mg/L) are insufficient to prevent hyponatremia and performance decline."
