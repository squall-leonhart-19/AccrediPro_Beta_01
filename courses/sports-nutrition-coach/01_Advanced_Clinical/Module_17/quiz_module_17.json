            "question": "To minimize the 'Interference Effect' in a hybrid athlete performing concurrent strength and endurance training, what is the recommended minimum recovery window between sessions?",
            "options": [
                "2 hours",
                "6-24 hours",
                "30-60 minutes",
                "48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a recovery window of 6-24 hours between sessions, with priority given to the primary training goal, minimizes the molecular signaling interference (AMPK vs. mTORC1) that can blunt strength adaptations."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In the assessment of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), what is the clinically recognized threshold for 'Low Energy Availability' (LEA) in females where physiological function begins to decline?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "35 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "30 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "20 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that energy availability below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the threshold at which hormonal disruption, specifically regarding LH pulsatility and T3 levels, becomes significant."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A female athlete with PCOS and insulin resistance is struggling with weight management despite high training volume. Which supplement ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol has shown the most promise in improving insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio",
                "10:1 ratio",

                "100:1 ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown in clinical trials to be most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a 65-year-old Masters Athlete, what is the recommended per-meal protein dose and leucine content to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "15-20g protein with 1g leucine",
                "20-25g protein with 2g leucine",
                "35-40g protein with 3-4g leucine",
                "50-60g protein with 5g leucine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Masters athletes require a higher 'leucine trigger' due to anabolic resistance. Research suggests 0.4-0.6g/kg per meal, typically totaling 35-40g of high-quality protein containing 3-4g of leucine, to achieve the same MPS response as younger athletes."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "An ultra-endurance runner experiences severe GI distress when consuming >60g of carbohydrates per hour. What is the most effective 'gut training' strategy to increase oxidation rates to 90g/hr?",
            "options": [
                "Switching entirely to liquid-only nutrition for 4 weeks",
                "Using a 2:1 glucose-to-fructose ratio to utilize multiple transportable carbohydrates (SGLT1 and GLUT5)",
                "Fasted training to improve fat oxidation and reduce reliance on exogenous carbs",
                "Increasing fiber intake to slow gastric emptying"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SGLT1 transporter for glucose saturates at ~60g/hr. By adding fructose (which uses the GLUT5 transporter) in a 2:1 or 1:0.8 ratio, athletes can increase total carbohydrate oxidation up to 90-120g/hr while reducing GI distress."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When training at high altitudes (>2,500m), why is it critical to assess an athlete's Ferritin levels prior to ascent?",
            "options": [
                "Iron is needed for glucose metabolism in thin air",
                "Low iron prevents the adaptive increase in red blood cell mass (erythropoiesis) stimulated by HIF-1α",
                "Iron prevents altitude sickness by buffering blood pH",
                "Altitude causes rapid iron excretion through sweat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Altitude triggers the production of Erythropoietin (EPO). Without sufficient iron stores (Ferritin >100 ng/mL for athletes), the body cannot synthesize the new hemoglobin required for altitude adaptation, leading to 'non-responders' and fatigue."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A combat athlete has 24 hours to rehydrate after a weigh-in where they lost 4kg (approx. 5% body mass). According to performance guidelines, how much fluid should they consume?",
            "options": [
                "4 Liters (100% of loss)",
                "5 Liters (125% of loss)",
                "6 Liters (150% of loss)",
                "8 Liters (200% of loss)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses during rehydration, athletes are advised to consume 150% of the fluid mass lost (1.5L for every 1kg lost) to restore fluid balance effectively."

                "Increasing carbohydrate intake to 8g/kg to prevent glycogen depletion",
                "Supplementing with 5g of Creatine Monohydrate daily",
                "Reducing protein intake to 0.8g/kg to match lower activity levels",
                "Consuming 15g of Collagen 6 hours after physical therapy"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creatine monohydrate has been shown in clinical trials to help maintain muscle mass and bone mineral density during periods of limb immobilization, likely through osmotic effects and modulation of myogenic transcription factors."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "For a client with PCOS, why is a 'Low Glycemic Index' diet specifically prioritized over a standard 'Low Calorie' diet for athletic performance?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the thermic effect of food (TEF) by 50%",
                "It reduces the hyperinsulinemic response, which in turn lowers androgen production in the ovaries",
                "It prevents the breakdown of muscle glycogen during rest",
                "It is the only way to induce a ketogenic state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia) stimulate the ovarian theca cells to produce excess androgens (testosterone). A Low-GI diet manages insulin spikes, helping to correct the hormonal imbalance characteristic of PCOS."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A landmark study (Baar et al.) demonstrated that 15g of gelatin or collagen combined with Vitamin C (a necessary cofactor for hydroxylation) significantly increases amino acid markers of collagen synthesis when paired with loading the target tissue."
