            "question": "To minimize the 'Interference Effect' in a hybrid athlete, what is the recommended minimum recovery window between high-intensity endurance training and resistance training to allow for AMPK levels to subside and mTOR signaling to dominate?",
            "options": [
                "30 to 60 minutes",
                "2 to 4 hours",
                "6 to 24 hours",
                "48 to 72 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests a 6-24 hour window between sessions helps minimize molecular interference. Specifically, high-intensity endurance training activates AMPK, which can inhibit the mTOR pathway required for muscle protein synthesis."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Clinical Low Energy Availability (LEA), the underlying cause of RED-S, is typically defined as an energy availability of less than how many calories per kilogram of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "30 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "20 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "15 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 45 kcal/kg FFM/day is considered optimal for physiological function, the threshold for clinical hormonal dysfunction and metabolic disturbances is generally recognized as falling below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When working with an athlete with PCOS and insulin resistance, which specific supplement ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol has been shown in clinical literature to most effectively improve metabolic parameters?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio",
                "10:1 ratio",
                "40:1 ratio",
                "100:1 ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown to be the most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients."

            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a 65-year-old Masters Athlete, what is the recommended protein dose per main meal to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "0.25g/kg body weight (~20g)",
                "0.40 - 0.50g/kg body weight (~35-40g)",
                "0.80g/kg body weight (~60-70g)",
                "Protein timing does not matter for Masters athletes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to anabolic resistance, older athletes require a higher per-meal leucine threshold to trigger MPS. Research indicates 0.4g/kg per meal (roughly 35-40g) is necessary, compared to the 0.25g/kg usually sufficient for younger athletes."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "An ultra-endurance runner experiences significant GI distress when consuming >60g of carbohydrates per hour. According to 'training the gut' protocols, what is the most likely physiological adaptation required to increase oxidation to 90-120g/hr?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the speed of gastric emptying",
                "Up-regulation of SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters",
                "Decreasing splanchnic blood flow",
                "Increasing stomach volume"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut training primarily works by increasing the expression and activity of glucose (SGLT1) and fructose (GLUT5) transporters in the small intestine, as well as improving gastric emptying rates and reducing the perception of fullness."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When an athlete transitions to a high-altitude training camp (>2,500m), why is it critical to assess Ferritin levels prior to departure?",
            "options": [
                "Altitude causes rapid iron excretion through sweat",
                "Erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) increases, placing high demand on iron stores",
                "Iron prevents altitude sickness (AMS)",
                "Iron is needed to buffer lactic acid in thin air"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hypoxic environment at altitude stimulates the production of new red blood cells to improve oxygen carrying capacity. This process (erythropoiesis) requires sufficient iron; athletes with low ferritin (<30-50 ng/mL) often fail to see performance benefits from altitude training."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "In combat sports, what is the maximum recommended percentage of body mass to lose through 'acute weight cutting' (dehydration) to ensure the athlete can safely rehydrate within a 24-hour weigh-in window?",
            "options": [
                "2-3% of body mass",
                "5-8% of body mass",
                "10-12% of body mass",
                "15% of body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many athletes cut more, losing more than 5-8% of body mass via acute dehydration significantly increases the risk of kidney injury and neurological trauma (reduced brain cushioning), and is difficult to fully reverse within 24 hours."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "To support collagen synthesis during injury rehabilitation (e.g., ACL or tendon repair), what nutritional intervention is supported by recent clinical trials (Baar et al.)?",
            "options": [
                "50g Whey Protein immediately post-rehab",
                "15g Collagen + 50mg Vitamin C taken 60 minutes before rehab",
                "5g Creatine taken daily at night",
                "High-dose Vitamin E (1000 IU) daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consuming 15g of gelatin/collagen with Vitamin C approximately 60 minutes before loading the tissue (rehab exercises) increases the circulating amino acids exactly when blood flow to the connective tissue is highest, doubling collagen synthesis markers."

            "question": "A hybrid athlete training for a CrossFit competition and a Marathon simultaneously reports chronic fatigue and a suppressed resting heart rate. Their current EA is 25 kcal/kg FFM. What is the priority intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caffeine intake to mask fatigue",
                "Switch to a ketogenic diet to improve fat oxidation",
                "Increase daily caloric intake to reach at least 40-45 kcal/kg FFM",
                "Add more HIIT sessions to improve metabolic efficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The athlete is showing signs of RED-S (Low Energy Availability). The priority is to restore energy balance to support hormonal health and recovery by increasing caloric intake to the optimal range (>40 kcal/kg FFM)."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "During a rapid rehydration protocol after a combat sport weigh-in, what is the recommended fluid volume to consume for every 1kg of body mass lost?",
            "options": [
                "500ml",
                "1 Liter",
                "1.5 Liters",
                "3 Liters"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses after dehydration, athletes should consume 150% of the fluid lost (1.5L for every 1kg of body mass lost) over the rehydration period, including significant sodium to retain the fluid."
