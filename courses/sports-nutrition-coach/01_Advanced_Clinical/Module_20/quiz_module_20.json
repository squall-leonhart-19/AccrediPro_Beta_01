            "question": "When utilizing Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) for advanced anthropometry, which factor is most likely to cause an overestimation of lean body mass?",
            "options": [
                "Acute hyperhydration of muscle tissue",
                "Low bone mineral density",
                "Recent consumption of a high-fat meal",
                "Subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "DXA interprets increased water content in the muscle as lean tissue. Research indicates that acute changes in hydration can shift lean mass readings by 1-3%, necessitating standardized testing conditions (fasted and hydrated)."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "An athlete undergoes a metabolic cart assessment. If their Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) is measured at 0.70 during steady-state exercise, what is their primary fuel source?",
            "options": [
                "100% Carbohydrate",
                "50% Carbohydrate / 50% Fat",
                "100% Fat",
                "Ketone bodies only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that the athlete is deriving 100% of their energy from lipid (fat) oxidation. As intensity increases and RER moves toward 1.0, the substrate utilization shifts toward 100% carbohydrate."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to the Precision Hydration framework, an athlete is classified as a 'High Sodium Loser' if their sweat sodium concentration exceeds which threshold?",
            "options": [
                "500 mg/L",
                "1,000 mg/L",
                "1,500 mg/L",
                "2,500 mg/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the average sodium loss is approximately 900 mg/L, athletes losing more than 1,000 mg/L are considered high-end losers and typically require specific electrolyte profiling to prevent hyponatremia and performance decrements."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "When analyzing performance blood chemistry, a decrease in the Free Testosterone to Cortisol (fT:C) ratio of more than ____% is often used as a marker for overreaching or overtraining.",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "30%",
                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A decline of 30% or more in the fT:C ratio is a clinically significant indicator of an altered anabolic-catabolic balance, suggesting the athlete is failing to recover from the current training load."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "An endurance athlete reports chronic bloating and upper GI distress during runs. Using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), which physiological mechanism should the coach investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "Delayed gastric emptying",
                "Rapid colonic transit",
                "Excessive bile acid production",
                "Increased sodium absorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Upper GI symptoms like bloating and fullness are hallmark signs of delayed gastric emptying, often caused by high-osmolarity sports drinks or high-intensity efforts diverting blood flow away from the gut."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is considered the most reliable for assessing parasympathetic (vagal) activity and recovery status in athletes?",
            "options": [
                "SDNN (Standard deviation of NN intervals)",
                "RMSSD (Root mean square of successive differences)",
                "LF/HF Ratio",
                "Mean Heart Rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the preferred metric in sports science because it is less influenced by breathing rates than other metrics and accurately reflects the parasympathetic 'rest and digest' system's influence on the heart."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A marathoner loses 2.4 kg of body mass during a 2-hour training run. They consumed 600 ml of fluid during the session. What is their calculated hourly sweat rate?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 L/hr",
                "1.5 L/hr",

                "3.0 L/hr"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sweat rate = (Weight loss + Fluid intake) / Time. (2.4kg [2400ml] + 600ml) / 2 hours = 3000ml / 2 = 1,500ml or 1.5 L/hr."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the context of dietary assessment technology, 'Energy Availability' (EA) calculations are frequently inaccurate due to underreporting. Research suggests elite athletes underreport intake by what average range?",
            "options": [
                "2-5%",
                "10-15%",
                "18-30%",
                "50-60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses using Doubly Labeled Water (DLW) as a gold standard show that even motivated athletes underreport their caloric intake by 18-30%, necessitating the use of error-correction factors in the PERFORM™ Dashboard."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "The PERFORM™ Dashboard integrates multiple data streams. If an athlete presents with a 'Yellow' recovery status (low HRV) but 'Green' performance metrics, what is the recommended coaching action?",
            "options": [
                "Complete rest for 48 hours",
                "Increase training volume to capitalize on performance",
                "Maintain load but increase monitoring and recovery interventions",
                "Ignore the HRV data as it is a lagging indicator"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This 'mismatch' suggests the athlete is functional but strained. Maintaining load while increasing recovery (sleep, nutrition) prevents the 'Yellow' status from progressing to a 'Red' status (non-functional overreaching)."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "For a female athlete, a serum Ferritin level below ____ ng/mL is considered 'Stage 1 Iron Deficiency' and can impair oxidative capacity even if Hemoglobin is normal.",
            "options": [
                "15 ng/mL",
                "30 ng/mL",
                "50 ng/mL",
                "100 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In sports nutrition, the threshold for iron deficiency (Stage 1) is typically set at 30 ng/mL. Below this, the synthesis of iron-dependent enzymes in the mitochondria can be compromised, affecting aerobic performance."
