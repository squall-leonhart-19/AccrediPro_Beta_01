            "question": "When interpreting Advanced Anthropometry, why is Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) measured via DXA considered a superior health marker to total body fat percentage in elite athletes?",
            "options": [
                "VAT is the primary energy source for high-intensity interval training (HIIT).",
                "VAT is more metabolically active and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines that can impair recovery.",
                "VAT levels are directly correlated with an athlete's VO2 max and aerobic capacity.",
                "VAT provides the structural cushioning necessary for high-impact contact sports."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike subcutaneous fat, VAT is highly metabolically active and associated with systemic inflammation, which can hinder an athlete's recovery and long-term metabolic health, even if total body fat is low."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "During a metabolic assessment using indirect calorimetry, an athlete produces a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.70. What does this specifically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete is utilizing 100% carbohydrate as their primary fuel source.",
                "The athlete is in a state of metabolic acidosis and high lactate production.",
                "The athlete is utilizing 100% fat as their primary fuel source.",
                "The athlete is in a state of protein catabolism and muscle wasting."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that 100% of the energy is being derived from fat oxidation. An RER of 1.0 would indicate 100% carbohydrate oxidation."

            "question": "A marathoner loses 2.5kg of body mass during a 2-hour training run while consuming 600ml of water. If their sweat sodium concentration is 1,000 mg/L, what is their total sodium loss?",
            "options": [
                "1,900 mg",
                "2,500 mg",

                "3,700 mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Total sweat loss = (Mass loss + Fluid intake). 2.5kg (2.5L) + 0.6L = 3.1L total sweat. 3.1L * 1,000 mg/L = 3,100 mg of sodium lost."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In biomarker analysis, what ferritin threshold is identified as 'Stage 1 Iron Depletion' for athletes, necessitating nutritional intervention despite normal hemoglobin levels?",
            "options": [
                "Ferritin < 12 ng/mL",
                "Ferritin < 35 ng/mL",
                "Ferritin < 50 ng/mL",
                "Ferritin < 75 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' clinical ranges may go lower, in sports nutrition, ferritin levels below 35 ng/mL are considered Stage 1 Iron Depletion, which can negatively impact oxidative enzyme function and performance."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "An athlete reports frequent GI distress during long-distance cycling. You use a transit time test (Blue Poop Challenge). What result would suggest 'Rapid Transit' likely contributing to nutrient malabsorption?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 10 hours",
                "Between 12 and 24 hours",
                "Exactly 36 hours",
                "Greater than 48 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A transit time of less than 10-12 hours is considered rapid, which often does not allow for sufficient contact time between chyme and the intestinal wall for optimal nutrient absorption."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When monitoring recovery, which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is most commonly used in the PERFORM™ dashboard because it reflects parasympathetic 'rest and digest' activity?",
            "options": [
                "SDNN (Standard deviation of NN intervals)",
                "LF/HF Ratio (Low frequency to high frequency)",
                "RMSSD (Root mean square of successive differences)",
                "PNS Index (Parasympathetic Nervous System Index)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is the preferred metric for daily athlete monitoring as it is highly sensitive to changes in the parasympathetic nervous system and is less affected by breathing rates than other metrics."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "The Goldberg cut-off is used to identify underreporting in dietary assessments. A Physical Activity Level (PAL) below which value is typically flagged as 'implausible' for a free-living athlete?",
            "options": [
                "1.1",

                "2.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A PAL of 1.1-1.2 is roughly equivalent to the Basal Metabolic Rate and is generally considered the lower limit of survival; reports below this in athletes usually indicate significant underreporting of intake."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Within the PERFORM™ Dashboard framework, the 'E' in the acronym stands for 'Evidence.' What does this specifically refer to?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete's personal testimonial of their performance.",
                "Using peer-reviewed research to validate the chosen intervention.",
                "The raw data collected from wearables and labs.",
                "The legal documentation required for supplement use."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Evidence' component of the PERFORM™ framework ensures that all interventions are grounded in scientific literature and proven physiological mechanisms."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "At what intensity level does the 'Crossover Point' typically occur in a moderately trained athlete, where the energy contribution from carbohydrates exceeds that of fats?",
            "options": [
                "35-45% of VO2 max",
                "60-65% of VO2 max",
                "80-85% of VO2 max",
                "95-100% of VO2 max"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In most moderately trained individuals, the crossover point occurs around 60-65% of VO2 max. Training can shift this point to the right, allowing for greater fat oxidation at higher intensities."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "If an athlete's sleep architecture shows a consistent lack of 'Slow Wave Sleep' (SWS/Stage 3), which physiological consequence is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Impaired memory consolidation and skill acquisition.",
                "Reduced growth hormone secretion and impaired physical tissue repair.",
                "Increased sympathetic nervous system dominance during the day.",
                "Reduced ability to metabolize caffeine effectively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) is the stage where the majority of growth hormone is released, making it the most critical stage for physical recovery, muscle protein synthesis, and tissue repair."
