            "question": "An elite marathoner is preparing for a race in 48 hours. According to the periodization protocols in Lesson 1, what is the recommended carbohydrate loading target to maximize glycogen stores?",
            "options": [
                "5-7g per kg of body mass per day",
                "10-12g per kg of body mass per day",
                "15-18g per kg of body mass per day",
                "8-10g per kg of lean muscle mass only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maximize muscle glycogen stores for an endurance event lasting over 90 minutes, a loading phase of 10-12g/kg/day for 36-48 hours is the evidence-based gold standard."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A combat athlete has lost 4kg during a weight cut. To ensure rapid rehydration and plasma volume restoration before the bout, how much fluid should they consume?",
            "options": [
                "4 Liters (100% of loss)",
                "2 Liters (50% of loss)",
                "6 Liters (150% of loss)",
                "8 Liters (200% of loss)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard sports nutrition guidelines for rapid rehydration recommend consuming 150% of the fluid mass lost (1.5L per 1kg lost) to account for continued obligatory urine losses."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the 'Strength Athlete’s Recovery Matrix,' what is the specific 'Leucine Threshold' typically required per meal to overcome anabolic resistance and maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In condensed schedules, rapid glycogen resynthesis is the priority. Consuming 1.0-1.2g/kg/hr of high-glycemic carbohydrates immediately post-match is critical for recovery."

                "Decrease to 0.2g/kg to protect kidney function",
                "Keep the same at 0.25g/kg",
                "Increase to 0.4-0.5g/kg to overcome anabolic resistance",
                "Increase to 1.0g/kg per meal regardless of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Masters athletes exhibit anabolic resistance, requiring a higher relative protein dose (0.4-0.5g/kg per meal) compared to younger athletes (0.25g/kg) to achieve the same MPS response."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In developmental athletes, what is the critical threshold of Energy Availability (EA) below which the risk of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) and hormonal disruption significantly increases?",

                "60 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 45 kcal/kg FFM/day is considered optimal for health and growth, an EA below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day is strongly associated with the negative physiological outcomes of RED-S."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "During the 'Immobilization Phase' of an injury (Lesson 7), which supplement has the strongest evidence for mitigating disuse muscle atrophy?",

                "L-Carnitine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creatine monohydrate (typically 5g/day) has been shown in clinical trials to reduce the rate of muscle atrophy during limb immobilization and enhance muscle regrowth during rehabilitation."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "An ultra-endurance athlete is competing in a 100-mile race in sub-zero temperatures. How does cold exposure affect their substrate utilization?",
            "options": [
                "It significantly increases carbohydrate oxidation due to shivering and increased catecholamines",
                "It shifts the body entirely to fat oxidation to preserve glucose for the brain",
                "It has no effect on substrate utilization; only fluid needs change",
                "It decreases the metabolic rate to conserve core body temperature"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cold exposure, especially if shivering occurs, significantly increases glycogen depletion and carbohydrate oxidation rates, necessitating a higher CHO intake compared to temperate environments."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A developmental swimmer (age 14) shows signs of stunted growth and frequent stress fractures. What is the first priority in their nutritional case management?",

                "Reducing training volume by 50% without changing diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The symptoms suggest RED-S. The primary intervention must be addressing the energy deficit (low EA) by increasing total energy intake to support both training and biological growth."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A strength athlete in the 'Hypertrophy Phase' is training twice a day. What is the recommended 'Protein Timing' strategy to maximize the 24-hour net protein balance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Distributing protein intake into moderate doses (20-40g, or 0.4g/kg) every 3-4 hours is more effective at sustaining MPS than large, infrequent doses."
