            "question": "In the case of an elite marathoner preparing for a sub-2:15 performance, what is the evidence-based carbohydrate loading recommendation for the 36-48 hours prior to the race?",
            "options": [
                "5-7g per kg of body mass",
                "8-10g per kg of body mass",
                "10-12g per kg of body mass",
                "15-18g per kg of body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current clinical guidelines for elite endurance athletes suggest 10-12g/kg of body mass of carbohydrates in the 36-48 hours prior to competition to maximize glycogen stores, which can improve performance by 2-3% in events lasting over 90 minutes."

            "question": "A combat athlete has 24 hours to rehydrate after a weigh-in where they lost 4% of their body mass. To ensure full restoration of fluid balance, what volume of fluid should be consumed?",
            "options": [
                "100% of the lost body mass (1.0L per 1kg lost)",
                "125% of the lost body mass (1.25L per 1kg lost)",
                "150% of the lost body mass (1.5L per 1kg lost)",
                "200% of the lost body mass (2.0L per 1kg lost)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because of obligatory urine losses during the rehydration process, athletes are advised to consume 150% of the fluid mass lost (1.5L for every 1kg of body mass deficit) to return to a state of euhydration."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Strength Athlete’s Recovery Matrix,' what is the minimum leucine threshold per meal required to optimally trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) in a 100kg elite powerlifter?",
            "options": [
                "~1.5 grams",
                "~3.0 grams",
                "~5.5 grams",
                "~7.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 2.5g to 3g of leucine is required per meal to reach the 'leucine trigger' point necessary to maximize the activation of the mTORC1 pathway and subsequent MPS."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In the 'Elite Team Sport Athlete' case study, what nutritional strategy is most effective for maintaining high-intensity running capacity during the second half of a match?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-fat meal 4 hours before kick-off",
                "Ingesting 30-60g of high-glycemic carbohydrates during the half-time interval",
                "Caffeine supplementation (9mg/kg) 10 minutes before the match",
                "Water-only hydration to prevent gastric distress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exogenous carbohydrate intake (30-60g) during half-time helps maintain blood glucose levels and spares muscle glycogen, which is critical for preserving sprinting performance and decision-making in the final 15-20 minutes of play."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "To combat 'anabolic resistance' in a 65-year-old Masters Athlete (Lesson 5), how should protein distribution be adjusted compared to a younger athlete?",
            "options": [
                "Lower protein intake to 0.8g/kg to protect renal function",
                "Consume all protein in one large bolus at dinner",
                "Increase per-meal protein doses to 0.4-0.5g/kg (approx. 35-40g per meal)",
                "Focus exclusively on collagen peptides rather than whey"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Masters athletes require a higher per-meal protein dose (0.4-0.5g/kg vs 0.25g/kg in youth) to overcome anabolic resistance and achieve the same fractional synthetic rate of muscle protein as younger counterparts."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the 'Developmental Athlete' case study, what is the clinical threshold for 'Low Energy Availability' (LEA) that significantly increases the risk of RED-S and hormonal dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Below 45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM)",
                "Below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM)",
                "Below 20 kcal/kg of Total Body Mass",
                "Below 1,500 total calories per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 45 kcal/kg FFM is considered optimal for health and growth in developing athletes, dropping below 30 kcal/kg FFM is the established threshold where metabolic and endocrine disruptions typically begin to occur."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "During the 'Immobilization Phase' of an ACL injury (Lesson 7), which supplement has the strongest evidence for mitigating muscle atrophy?",
            "options": [
                "Glucosamine",
                "Beta-Alanine",
                "Creatine Monohydrate",
                "L-Carnitine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creatine monohydrate (5g/day) has been shown in several clinical trials to help maintain muscle mass and GLUT4 density during periods of limb immobilization and can accelerate muscle hypertrophy during the subsequent rehabilitation phase."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "An ultra-endurance athlete competing in the Badwater 135 (extreme heat) is experiencing GI distress. What is the most likely nutritional cause based on Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "A carbohydrate intake of 60g/hour",
                "Hypertonic fluid concentrations (>8% CHO) combined with high sweat rates",
                "The use of multiple transportable carbohydrates (glucose:fructose)",
                "Consuming 500mg of sodium per hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In extreme heat, gastric emptying slows. If an athlete consumes hypertonic solutions (high sugar concentration) while dehydrated, it draws water into the gut via osmosis, leading to bloating and diarrhea."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "When managing a 'Weight Cut' for a combat athlete, what is the maximum recommended percentage of body mass to lose via 'Acute Weight Loss' (fluid manipulation) to avoid significant performance decrements?",
            "options": [
                "2% of body mass",
                "5% of body mass",
                "10% of body mass",
                "15% of body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Losing more than 5% of body mass through acute dehydration (sweating, water loading, etc.) is associated with significant decreases in plasma volume, increased core temperature, and reduced power output, even with a 24-hour recovery."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A 20-year-old female soccer player presents with a stress fracture and secondary amenorrhea. Based on the Case Study in Lesson 6, what is the priority intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing Calcium intake to 2,000mg/day",
                "Reducing training volume while maintaining current caloric intake",
                "Increasing Energy Availability (EA) by adding ~300-500 kcal/day",
                "Prescribing oral contraceptives to regulate the menstrual cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The priority for treating RED-S is to resolve the energy deficit. Increasing energy availability (EA) is the only way to restore normal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis function; oral contraceptives merely mask the issue by inducing withdrawal bleeding without fixing bone mineral density issues."
