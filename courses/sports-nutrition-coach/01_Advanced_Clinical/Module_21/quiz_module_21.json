            "question": "In the 'Dual-Track Planning Model' (L2), how does nutritional periodization change during the 'Competition Phase' compared to the 'General Preparatory Phase'?",
            "options": [
                "It shifts from high-protein/low-carb to high-fat/moderate-protein.",
                "It shifts from metabolic flexibility training to performance-driven glycogen saturation.",
                "It focuses exclusively on micronutrient density rather than caloric totals.",
                "It eliminates all ergogenic aids to prevent digestive distress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the prep phase may use 'train low' strategies to improve fat oxidation, the competition phase prioritizes high carbohydrate availability to fuel the specific high-intensity demands of the event."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calculation: (1.5kg weight loss + 0.5L intake) / 1.5 hours = 1.33 L/hr. Accurate sweat rate mapping is critical for preventing the >2% dehydration threshold."
