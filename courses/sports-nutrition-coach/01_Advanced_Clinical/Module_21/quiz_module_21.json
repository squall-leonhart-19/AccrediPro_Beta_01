            "question": "In Lesson 1, 'Baseline Performance Mapping' is defined as a critical intake step. What is the primary objective of this process?",
            "options": [
                "To calculate the athlete's exact Basal Metabolic Rate using indirect calorimetry",
                "To identify the physiological gap between current metabolic capacity and the specific energy demands of the sport",
                "To determine the athlete's body fat percentage using a 7-site skinfold protocol",
                "To prescribe a generic macronutrient ratio based on the athlete's body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baseline Performance Mapping goes beyond simple caloric math; it assesses the discrepancy between the athlete's current physiological state and the metabolic requirements (glycolytic vs. oxidative) of their competitive level."

        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "The 'Dual-Track Planning Model' in Advanced Periodization (Lesson 2) separates interventions into which two distinct categories?",

                "The Caloric Track and the Micronutrient Track",
                "The Hypertrophy Track and the Fat Loss Track",
                "The Performance Track (Output) and the Metabolic Track (Health/Recovery)",
                "The Competition Track and the Off-Season Track"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual-Track model ensures that while the Performance Track focuses on fueling output and power, the Metabolic Track simultaneously manages systemic inflammation, hormonal health, and long-term physiological sustainability."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Energy System Specificity, which substrate strategy is most effective for an athlete in the 'Glycolytic-Oxidative Transition' (e.g., a 1500m runner)?",

                "Fat-adaptation via a ketogenic diet to spare glycogen",
                "Chronic low-carbohydrate training to increase mitochondrial density",
                "Strategic carbohydrate mouth rinsing only",
                "High pre-event glycogen saturation combined with intra-event buffering agents like sodium bicarbonate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Athletes in high-intensity transition zones require maximal glycogen availability for anaerobic glycolysis and buffering agents to manage the resulting metabolic acidosis (H+ accumulation)."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Recovery Architecture.' Which physiological marker is the most sensitive indicator that an athlete requires a shift from tissue repair protocols to CNS-focused recovery?",

                "A slight increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Central Nervous System (CNS) fatigue is best identified through autonomic nervous system markers like HRV and sleep quality, requiring different nutritional support (e.g., higher micronutrient density and parasympathetic-promoting foods) than simple protein-based tissue repair."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "In Functional Food Therapy (Lesson 5), a 2022 meta-analysis is cited regarding Nitrate supplementation. What was the observed effect on submaximal exercise?",

                "A 20% increase in peak power output during sprinting",
                "No significant effect was found in elite-level populations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nitrates (found in beetroot juice) improve mitochondrial efficiency, specifically reducing the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise by 3-5%, which is a massive margin in elite endurance sports."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "Precision Hydration (Lesson 6) states that for events exceeding 2 hours, what percentage of hourly sodium loss should typically be replaced to maintain homeostasis?",
            "options": [
                "10-20% of total losses",
                "100% of total losses to ensure no deficit",
                "50-70% of total hourly sodium losses",
                "Sodium replacement is only necessary if the athlete experiences cramping"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Replacing 50-70% of lost sodium is the 'sweet spot' for maintaining plasma volume and osmotic balance without causing the GI distress often associated with 100% replacement protocols."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "During 'Iterative Results Tracking' (Lesson 7), if an athlete shows stagnant performance and a 'flat' glucose curve during training, what is the most likely adjustment needed?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A flat glucose curve during high-intensity training often suggests insufficient exogenous carbohydrate delivery or poor absorption, requiring a shift to higher glycemic index fuels that can be oxidized more rapidly."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Lesson 8 focuses on 'Implementation Intentions' for behavioral adherence. Which of the following is an example of this technique?",

                "Using a restrictive 'No-Go' list of forbidden foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (If-Then planning) automate decision-making, reducing the cognitive load on the athlete and significantly increasing adherence in high-stress environments."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A case study in Lesson 6 describes an Ironman triathlete with chronic GI distress. After analyzing their fuel, the osmolality was found to be 450 mOsm/L. What is the recommended intervention?",

                "Increase the concentration of the drink to provide more energy",
                "Dilute the solution to bring it closer to isotonic levels (approx. 280-300 mOsm/L) to improve gastric emptying",

                "Remove all electrolytes from the solution"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypertonic solutions (>300 mOsm/L) draw water into the gut, causing bloating and diarrhea. Diluting the solution to an isotonic or slightly hypotonic state improves absorption and resolves GI distress."

        {
            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "Based on the Ergogenic Programming in Lesson 5, what is the 'saturation threshold' for Beta-Alanine required to significantly increase muscle carnosine levels?",

                "A single 10g dose before a competition",
                "A total cumulative dose of approximately 179g over 4-10 weeks",

                "Beta-alanine does not require a loading phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that the benefits of Beta-Alanine are dose-dependent and cumulative; it requires a total loading phase of roughly 179g (usually 4.8-6.4g/day) to saturate muscle carnosine stores."
