            "options": [
                "It uses a larger sample size by pooling data from multiple studies to increase statistical power.",
                "It is the only type of study that can prove 100% causation in sports nutrition.",
                "It relies exclusively on qualitative data from expert opinions.",
                "It ignores studies with negative results to focus on successful interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A meta-analysis pools data from multiple RCTs, which increases the total sample size (N) and reduces the risk of 'false positives' or 'false negatives' found in individual small-scale studies."

            "question": "A performance coach reads a study where a supplement improved sprint times with a p-value of 0.04 and a Cohen's d effect size of 0.15. How should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "The result is statistically significant and represents a large, meaningful change for the athlete.",
                "The result is not statistically significant and should be ignored entirely.",
                "The result is statistically significant, but the practical effect size is 'trivial' or small.",
                "The p-value is too high to be considered relevant in elite sports science."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While p < 0.05 denotes statistical significance, a Cohen's d of 0.15 is considered a 'small' or 'trivial' effect size, suggesting the practical impact on performance may be minimal."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based periodization involves 'training low' (low glycogen) at specific times to signal greater mitochondrial adaptations, while 'training high' for high-intensity or competition-specific sessions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates that fat is the primary fuel source, while an RER of 1.00 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies have shown that acute sleep restriction significantly impairs the muscle protein synthetic response and elevates catabolic hormones like cortisol."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beta-alanine increases muscle carnosine levels, which acts as an intracellular buffer against the accumulation of hydrogen ions (acidosis) during high-intensity exercise."

                "Lab protocols are usually more accurate than field measurements.",
                "Indoor labs often lack the 'wind-speed' or convective cooling found outdoors, which alters sweat evaporation rates.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental factors like wind speed and solar radiation significantly impact thermoregulation and sweat rates, factors that are often missing or controlled in static lab environments."

                "The supplement is guaranteed to improve performance by 4.2 seconds.",
                "The result is statistically significant because the range includes positive numbers.",
