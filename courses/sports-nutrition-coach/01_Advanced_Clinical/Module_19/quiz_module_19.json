            "question": "In the Hierarchy of Evidence for Sports Nutrition, which of the following represents the highest level of evidence for establishing clinical guidelines?",
            "options": [
                "Expert Consensus Statements",
                "Case-Control Studies",
                "Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of RCTs",
                "Single-blind Randomized Controlled Trials"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses sit at the top of the hierarchy because they synthesize data from multiple high-quality RCTs, reducing bias and increasing statistical power."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A coach reviews a study where a supplement showed a p-value of 0.03 but a Cohen’s d effect size of 0.18. How should this be interpreted in a performance context?",
            "options": [
                "The result is statistically significant but the practical effect is trivial.",
                "The result is not significant and should be ignored.",

                "The p-value is too high to be considered statistically relevant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance, but a Cohen's d of 0.18 is considered a 'trivial' or 'small' effect size, meaning the real-world performance benefit may be negligible."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 reflects 100% fat oxidation, while 1.00 reflects 100% carbohydrate oxidation. 0.85 represents a balanced mix of both substrate sources."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses suggest that a leucine trigger of approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams is necessary to activate the mTORC1 pathway and maximize the MPS response in most athletes."

            "id": "q19_6",

                "Laboratory scales are less accurate than field scales.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Laboratory settings often lack the air movement (convection) found in the field, which can lead to higher core temperatures and different sweat rates compared to actual performance conditions."

            "options": [
                "The supplement is 95% likely to work.",
                "The results are statistically significant because the upper bound is positive.",
