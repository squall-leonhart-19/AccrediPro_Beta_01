            "question": "In the PERFORM method for multi-sport athletes, which 'E' component is prioritized when an athlete reports unexplained fatigue and a 15% drop in power output during the 'Build' phase?",
            "options": [
                "Electrolyte Balance",
                "Energy Availability",
                "Ergogenic Optimization",
                "Emotional Regulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy Availability (EA) is the primary concern when performance drops significantly during high-volume phases. Ensuring the athlete meets the >45 kcal/kg FFM/day threshold is critical to prevent overreaching."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to nutritional immunology research, what is the 'Open Window' period following high-intensity exercise where the immune system is most suppressed?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Open Window' theory suggests that the immune system is compromised for 3 to 72 hours post-strenuous exercise, increasing susceptibility to Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTIs)."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "For a client recovering from a Grade II ACL strain, which nutritional protocol is most evidence-based for accelerating collagen synthesis during the 'Repair' phase?",
            "options": [
                "5g Collagen + 10mg Vitamin C, 2 hours post-rehab",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Baar et al.) show that 15-20g of collagen combined with Vitamin C, taken 60 minutes before loading the tissue, significantly increases pro-collagen markers."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When an athlete transitions to an altitude of >2,500m, what is the primary nutritional priority to support the 250% increase in erythropoiesis?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing sodium intake to 5,000mg/day",

                "Reducing carbohydrate intake to 3g/kg to favor fat oxidation",
                "Supplementing with 10g of Leucine daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron is the rate-limiting factor for hemoglobin mass expansion at altitude. Athletes should have ferritin levels >30-50 ng/mL (preferably >100 for elites) to effectively adapt to hypoxia."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EIGS is caused by blood being shunted away from the gut to the working muscles and skin (splanchnic hypoperfusion), leading to intestinal ischemia and increased permeability ('leaky gut')."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the context of RED-S and the Female Athlete Triad, at what Energy Availability (EA) level do physiological impairments, such as suppressed RMR and hormonal disruption, consistently begin to manifest?",

                "Below 20 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 45 kcal/kg FFM/day is considered optimal, research indicates that the threshold for clinical disruption to bone health, menses, and metabolic rate is typically below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-alanine increases muscle carnosine (intracellular buffer), while Sodium Bicarbonate increases blood bicarbonate levels (extracellular buffer), providing a dual-action pH management system."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjustment is the critical phase where the coach reviews the athlete's progress, subjective feedback, and objective data (like HRV or power) to pivot the nutrition strategy for the next microcycle."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In cold environments, peripheral vasoconstriction increases central blood volume, leading the kidneys to excrete more fluid (cold-induced diuresis). Additionally, the thirst mechanism is often blunted by up to 40%."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent exposure to high carbohydrate intakes during exercise (Training the Gut) upregulates SGLT1 (glucose) and GLUT5 (fructose) transporters, reducing residual unabsorbed CHO and GI distress."
