            "question": "Based on the research by Baar et al. discussed in Lesson 7, what is the optimal protocol for stimulating collagen synthesis in connective tissues?",
            "options": [
                "15g of collagen with 50mg of Vitamin C taken 60 minutes before targeted loading",
                "25g of whey protein with 5g of Leucine taken immediately after loading",
                "10g of collagen taken 30 minutes after exercise with a carbohydrate source",
                "5g of collagen taken three times daily regardless of exercise timing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 15g of gelatin/collagen paired with Vitamin C approximately 1 hour before exercise increases the appearance of pro-collagen markers in the blood, as the peak amino acid availability coincides with the mechanical loading of the tissue."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During the immobilization phase of an injury (Lesson 5), why is it critical to maintain protein intake at 2.0–2.3g/kg/day despite the lack of activity?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the rate of fat oxidation while inactive",
                "To counteract 'anabolic resistance' and minimize the loss of lean body mass",
                "To prevent the development of systemic inflammation",
                "To ensure the athlete remains in a significant caloric surplus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immobilized muscle becomes 'anabolically resistant,' meaning it requires a higher leucine threshold and greater total protein intake to trigger muscle protein synthesis (MPS) compared to healthy, active muscle."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 2 found that athletes with Vitamin D levels below what threshold had a significantly higher risk of stress fractures?",
            "options": [
                "30 nmol/L",
                "50 nmol/L",
                "75 nmol/L",
                "125 nmol/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'sufficiency' is often defined as 50 nmol/L in the general population, athletic performance and bone injury prevention research suggests a higher threshold of at least 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) is required for optimal bone stress injury prevention."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In the context of concussion recovery (Lesson 4), what is the primary mechanism by which Creatine Monohydrate serves as a neuroprotective agent?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the thickness of the blood-brain barrier",
                "By reducing the amount of glucose required by the brain",
                "By maintaining ATP levels and reducing the metabolic 'energy crisis' post-impact",
                "By acting as a sedative to ensure the athlete rests"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Following a concussion, the brain experiences a 'metabolic crisis' where ATP demand exceeds supply. Creatine helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis and reduces oxidative stress during this critical recovery window."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 6, how does a major orthopedic surgery (like an ACL reconstruction) typically affect an athlete's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?",
            "options": [
                "BMR decreases by 10-20% due to lack of movement",
                "BMR remains unchanged as the athlete is sedentary",
                "BMR increases by 15% to 50% depending on the severity of the trauma",
                "BMR only increases if the athlete has a post-operative fever"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The metabolic cost of wound healing and tissue repair is significant. Post-surgical trauma can elevate BMR by 15% to 50%, meaning that drastically cutting calories due to 'inactivity' can actually impair the healing process."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the ACL Recovery Case Study (Lesson 8), why was the Omega-3 dosage increased to 4g (EPA/DHA) during the first two weeks post-surgery?",
            "options": [
                "To replace all other fat sources in the diet",
                "To manage acute inflammation and modulate the pro-inflammatory cytokine response",
                "To improve the taste of the meal plan",
                "To accelerate the rate of bone mineral density gain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-dose Omega-3 fatty acids (specifically EPA and DHA) are used in the acute phase of injury to modulate the inflammatory response, reducing excessive swelling while allowing the natural healing cascade to occur."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "What is the recommended protocol for Tart Cherry Juice supplementation to manage inflammation and DOMS (Lesson 3)?",
            "options": [
                "30ml of concentrate twice daily for 7 days prior to and 2 days after intense effort",
                "100ml once a week on rest days",
                "500ml taken only during the workout",
                "Tart cherry juice should only be used if the athlete is allergic to NSAIDs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The standard evidence-based protocol for anthocyanin-rich tart cherry juice is 30ml of concentrate (or ~250-300ml juice) twice daily, starting several days before the stressor to 'load' the antioxidants."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is a mandatory co-factor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine during collagen cross-linking (Lesson 1)?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is essential for the enzymes prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. Without Vitamin C, collagen fibers cannot be properly cross-linked, leading to weak connective tissue."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "According to Lesson 2, the 'Female and Male Athlete Triad' links low energy availability (LEA) to which hormonal disruption that directly impacts bone health?",
            "options": [
                "Increased insulin sensitivity",
                "Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis",
                "Excessive production of growth hormone",
                "Decreased cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low energy availability leads to the suppression of reproductive hormones (like estrogen and testosterone), which are vital for bone resorption balance. This suppression is a primary driver of reduced bone mineral density and stress fractures."

        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "During the 'Remodeling Phase' of soft tissue repair (Lesson 1 & 8), what should be the primary nutritional focus?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to prevent weight gain",
                "High-dose antioxidants to stop all inflammation",
                "Supportive nutrients for collagen turnover and progressive loading (Protein, Vit C, Copper)",
                "Complete elimination of carbohydrates to reduce systemic acidity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The remodeling phase requires adequate energy and specific building blocks (protein, collagen precursors, and minerals like copper and zinc) to support the strengthening of the new tissue as the athlete returns to loading."
