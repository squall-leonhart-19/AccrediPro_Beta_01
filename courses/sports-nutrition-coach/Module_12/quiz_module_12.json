            "question": "In the PERFORM Method's 'F' (Frequency & Flexibility) component for multi-sport athletes, how should a coach prioritize nutritional timing for 'double-day' sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Prioritize the session with the highest glycolytic demand for the majority of daily carbohydrate allocation.",
                "Maintain an even distribution of macronutrients regardless of session intensity to ensure metabolic stability.",
                "Focus exclusively on post-workout protein to prevent muscle protein breakdown during the second session.",
                "Implement a 'sleep low' strategy every night to maximize fat oxidation for both sports."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In multi-sport integration, the PERFORM method emphasizes periodizing intake based on the specific metabolic demands of each session. High-intensity or glycolytic sessions require the 'P' (Periodization) and 'E' (Energy) components to be front-loaded to support performance and glycogen replenishment."

            "question": "According to nutritional immunology research, what is the 'Open Window' theory's typical duration regarding post-exercise immune suppression?",
            "options": [
                "15 to 30 minutes post-exercise.",
                "3 to 72 hours post-exercise.",
                "Exactly 12 hours for all athletes.",
                "Only occurs if the athlete is in a fasted state."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Open Window' theory suggests that after intense, prolonged exercise, the immune system is suppressed for 3 to 72 hours, increasing the risk of opportunistic infections (URTIs). Proper carbohydrate and micronutrient intake (Vitamin C, D, Zinc) can mitigate this window."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "During the 'Remodeling Phase' of injury rehabilitation, what is the primary nutritional objective to ensure tissue functional integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to prevent fat gain while the athlete is sedentary.",
                "High-dose antioxidant supplementation to completely eliminate residual inflammation.",
                "Optimizing leucine-rich protein intake and collagen precursors to support cross-linking of fibers.",
                "Limiting water intake to reduce localized edema around the scar tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Remodeling phase requires structural support. Leucine-rich protein triggers Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS), while collagen precursors (Proline, Vitamin C) support the maturation and cross-linking of new tissue fibers."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "At high altitudes (>2,500m), why is there a physiological shift toward increased glucose reliance for energy metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "Glucose produces more ATP per mole of oxygen consumed compared to fatty acids.",
                "Fat oxidation is completely disabled in hypoxic environments.",
                "The body cannot digest proteins at high altitudes due to low pressure.",
                "Altitude exposure increases insulin sensitivity to the point of hypoglycemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In hypoxic (low oxygen) environments, the body favors glucose because it is more oxygen-efficient, yielding approximately 15% more ATP per mole of oxygen compared to the oxidation of fatty acids."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism of Exercise-Induced GI Syndrome (EIGS) characterized by 'leaky gut'?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive fiber intake leading to mechanical scratching of the intestinal wall.",
                "Splanchnic hypoperfusion causing ischemia and subsequent epithelial cell damage.",
                "Over-hydration leading to osmotic swelling of the gastric lining.",
                "The use of caffeine which permanently relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During intense exercise, blood is shunted away from the gut to the working muscles and skin (splanchnic hypoperfusion). This lack of oxygen (ischemia) damages the intestinal lining, increasing permeability (leaky gut) and allowing endotoxins into circulation."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the clinical detection of RED-S, what energy availability (EA) threshold is widely considered the 'danger zone' for hormonal and metabolic dysfunction in female athletes?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "35 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "Below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "Below 15 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that when energy availability drops below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day, the body begins to suppress non-essential systems, including reproductive hormones and bone turnover, leading to the symptoms of RED-S."

            "question": "When stacking Beta-Alanine and Sodium Bicarbonate for an 800m runner, what is the specific physiological advantage?",
            "options": [
                "One increases oxygen carrying capacity while the other increases fat oxidation.",
                "They provide a dual-buffer system, addressing both intracellular and extracellular pH levels.",
                "They act synergistically to increase the rate of gastric emptying.",
                "Beta-alanine prevents the common side effect of explosive diarrhea caused by bicarbonate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-alanine increases muscle carnosine (intracellular buffer), while Sodium Bicarbonate increases blood bicarbonate levels (extracellular buffer). Stacking them provides a comprehensive defense against the acidosis that limits high-intensity performance."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "During the 'Adjustment' phase of a PERFORM consultation, an athlete reports persistent fatigue despite hitting caloric targets. Which metric should the coach investigate first?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete's social media engagement for signs of stress.",
                "The timing of carbohydrate intake relative to training (Nutrient Timing).",
                "The brand of multivitamin the athlete is currently using.",
                "The athlete's maximum heart rate during a 100m sprint."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If total energy is sufficient but fatigue persists, the 'Adjustment' phase focuses on the 'O' (Optimization) and 'R' (Re-fueling) of the PERFORM method—specifically, whether the timing of intake aligns with the periods of highest metabolic demand."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis on injury recovery showed that supplementing with 15g of Collagen Peptides 60 minutes before rehab exercise resulted in what outcome?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% reduction in muscle soreness but no change in tissue markers.",
                "Increased circulating amino acids but decreased collagen synthesis.",
                "Doubled markers of collagen synthesis compared to a placebo.",
                "Immediate restoration of full range of motion in grade III sprains."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific clinical protocols show that 15g of collagen combined with Vitamin C, taken one hour before loading exercises, significantly increases the appearance of collagen precursors in the blood and doubles collagen synthesis markers in the targeted tissue."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "An ultra-endurance athlete suffers from GI distress (bloating/cramping) when consuming >60g/hr of carbohydrates. What is the most evidence-based 'Gut Training' protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Switching to a ketogenic diet for 4 weeks to eliminate carbohydrate dependence.",
                "Gradually increasing carbohydrate intake during training sessions over 6-10 weeks to upregulate SGLT1 transporters.",
                "Drinking only plain water during all training sessions to 'rest' the gut.",
                "Taking high-dose NSAIDs before every training session to reduce gut inflammation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut training involves progressively increasing the carbohydrate load during exercise. This physiological adaptation upregulates the SGLT1 (glucose) and GLUT5 (fructose) transporters, increasing the gut's absorptive capacity and reducing residual fermentation that causes distress."
