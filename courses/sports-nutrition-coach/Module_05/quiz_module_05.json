            "question": "At what threshold of body mass loss due to dehydration does a significant decline in aerobic performance and cognitive function typically occur?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% to 1.0%",
                "2.0% to 3.0%",
                "5.0% to 7.0%",
                "Over 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that a loss of ≥2% of body mass significantly impairs aerobic performance, increases perceived exertion, and degrades cognitive processing, particularly in temperate or hot environments."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which electrolyte is the primary cation in extracellular fluid and is the most critical for maintaining plasma volume and the thirst mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Potassium",
                "Magnesium",
                "Calcium",
                "Sodium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sodium is the primary electrolyte in the extracellular fluid. It regulates osmotic pressure, maintains plasma volume, and is essential for stimulating the thirst mechanism and promoting fluid retention."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "An athlete uses the 'WUT' monitoring system. Upon waking, they note: Weight is down 1.5%, Urine is dark (USG >1.020), and Thirst is high. What is the clinical interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "Likely Euhydrated",
                "Likely Dehydrated",

                "Clinically Hyperhydrated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'WUT' system looks at Weight, Urine, and Thirst. If one is present, dehydration is possible; if two are present, it is likely; if all three are present, it is 'Very Likely' that the athlete is dehydrated."

            "question": "To ensure optimal pre-exercise hydration, the ACSM recommends consuming how much fluid 2 to 4 hours prior to an event for an athlete who is not adequately hydrated?",
            "options": [
                "2-3 ml/kg of body weight",
                "5-10 ml/kg of body weight",

                "Exactly 1 liter regardless of weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Current guidelines recommend 5-10 ml/kg of body weight 2-4 hours before exercise. This allows enough time for fluid absorption and the excretion of any excess via urine."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "An athlete weighs 80kg before a 90-minute session and 78.2kg after. They consumed 800ml of fluid during the session. What is their hourly sweat rate?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 L/hr",
                "1.5 L/hr",

                "2.6 L/hr"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sweat loss = (Weight Change + Fluid Intake). 80kg - 78.2kg = 1.8kg (1800ml). Total loss = 1800ml + 800ml = 2600ml. Hourly rate = 2600ml / 1.5 hours = 1733ml or ~1.73 L/hr."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "To achieve complete rehydration following exercise, why is it recommended to consume 125% to 150% of the fluid volume lost during the session?",
            "options": [
                "To account for obligatory urine losses and continued sweating",
                "To increase metabolic rate via thermogenesis",
                "To ensure maximum glycogen loading",
                "To prevent Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Replacing only 100% of losses is insufficient because the body continues to lose fluid through urine production and post-exercise sweating. 125-150% ensures a return to a positive fluid balance."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In high-humidity environments, why is the risk of heat-related illness significantly increased?",
            "options": [
                "Convective heat loss is increased",
                "The air contains more oxygen, increasing metabolic heat",
                "Evaporative cooling is impaired due to the low vapor pressure gradient",
                "Sweat production stops entirely in humidity above 70%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evaporation of sweat is the primary cooling mechanism. High humidity reduces the vapor pressure gradient between the skin and the air, preventing sweat from evaporating and thus trapping heat in the body."

            "id": "q5_8",

                "115 mmol/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EAH is defined as a serum sodium concentration <135 mmol/L. It is often caused by overconsumption of hypotonic fluids (water) beyond the capacity of the kidneys to excrete the excess."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which of the following carbohydrate concentrations in a sports drink is considered 'isotonic' and ideal for maximizing both gastric emptying and intestinal absorption?",
            "options": [
                "2-3%",
                "6-8%",

                "20-25%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A carbohydrate concentration of 6-8% (60-80g per Liter) is isotonic or slightly hypotonic, which optimizes the rate of gastric emptying and maximizes fluid transport across the intestinal wall."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which physiological phenomenon describes the increase in heart rate that occurs during prolonged exercise to compensate for a decrease in stroke volume caused by fluid loss?",
            "options": [
                "Cardiac Output Surge",
                "Hypovolemic Rebound",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cardiovascular drift refers to the progressive increase in heart rate during steady-state exercise, often exacerbated by dehydration which reduces plasma volume and stroke volume."
