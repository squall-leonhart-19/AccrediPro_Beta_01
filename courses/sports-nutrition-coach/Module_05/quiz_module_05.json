            "question": "At what threshold of body mass loss due to dehydration does a significant decrement in aerobic exercise performance and cognitive function typically become measurable?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% of body mass",
                "1.0% of body mass",
                "2.0% of body mass",
                "5.0% of body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Extensive research, including meta-analyses of endurance athletes, demonstrates that a body mass deficit of ≥2% significantly impairs aerobic performance, increases perceived exertion, and degrades cognitive processing speed."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which electrolyte is the primary extracellular cation lost in the highest concentration through sweat, and what is its typical concentration range?",
            "options": [
                "Potassium; 20–80 mmol/L",
                "Sodium; 20–80 mmol/L",
                "Magnesium; 1–5 mmol/L",
                "Chloride; 100–110 mmol/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sodium is the primary electrolyte lost in sweat. While highly variable between 'salty sweaters' and others, the typical range is 20–80 mmol/L, compared to potassium which is much lower (approx. 4–5 mmol/L)."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'WUT' acronym is a validated field-based tool for monitoring hydration status. What do the letters stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Water, Urea, Temperature",
                "Weight, Urine color, Thirst",

                "Weight, Uric acid, Thirst"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "WUT stands for Weight (stable morning weight), Urine (color, specifically aiming for pale yellow), and Thirst (presence of thirst). If two or more indicators are 'off,' dehydration is likely."

            "question": "According to ACSM guidelines, if an athlete is not adequately hydrated 4 hours prior to an event, what is the recommended fluid intake volume?",
            "options": [
                "2-3 mL/kg of body weight",

                "20 mL/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ACSM recommends 5-7 mL per kilogram of body weight at least 4 hours before exercise. If the athlete remains hypohydrated (no urine output or dark urine), an additional 3-5 mL/kg should be consumed 2 hours before."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "An athlete weighs 80kg before a 90-minute training session and 78.2kg after. During the session, they consumed 800mL of fluid. What is their calculated hourly sweat rate?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 Liters/hour",
                "1.73 Liters/hour",

                "1.0 Liters/hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calculation: (Weight Loss + Fluid Intake) / Time. (1.8kg + 0.8L) = 2.6L total loss. 2.6L / 1.5 hours = 1.73 L/hr."
        },

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "To ensure complete rehydration and account for obligatory urine losses post-exercise, what percentage of the total fluid mass lost should be consumed?",
            "options": [
                "75-100%",
                "100-110%",

                "200-250%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that consuming 125% to 150% of the fluid volume lost (1.25L to 1.5L for every 1kg lost) is necessary to restore fluid balance and compensate for increased urine production following rapid rehydration."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Why is the risk of dehydration significantly higher in high-altitude environments compared to sea level?",
            "options": [
                "Increased humidity reduces sweat evaporation",
                "Increased respiratory water loss and altitude-induced diuresis",
                "Decreased metabolic rate reduces the need for water",
                "Higher oxygen pressure increases thirst suppression"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "At altitude, the air is drier, leading to increased respiratory water loss. Additionally, the body undergoes 'altitude diuresis' (increased urination) as part of the acclimatization process to concentrate red blood cells."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia (EAH) is primarily caused by which of the following mechanisms?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of hypotonic fluids (water) exceeding sweat and renal output",
                "Excessive intake of salt tablets without enough water",
                "Severe dehydration resulting in high serum sodium levels",
                "Inadequate protein intake during ultra-endurance events"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EAH is defined by a serum sodium concentration <135 mmol/L and is most commonly caused by over-drinking (fluid overload) beyond the body's ability to excrete the excess water, often exacerbated by inappropriate ADH secretion."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "What is the recommended carbohydrate concentration for an intra-exercise sports drink to optimize the rate of gastric emptying and intestinal absorption?",
            "options": [
                "2-4%",
                "6-8%",
                "10-12%",
                "15-20%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A carbohydrate concentration of 6-8% (isotonic) is ideal. Concentrations higher than 8% (hypertonic) can delay gastric emptying and cause gastrointestinal distress by drawing water into the gut."

            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "A marathon runner finishes a race and presents with 'pitting edema' (swelling) in the hands, a headache, and slight confusion. They mention they drank at every single aid station. What is the most likely physiological issue?",
            "options": [
                "Severe Hypernatremia",
                "Heat Stroke",
                "Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia",
                "Glycogen Depletion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Swelling (edema), headache, and confusion in an athlete who has consumed high volumes of fluid are classic symptoms of hyponatremia (low blood sodium), which is a medical emergency."
