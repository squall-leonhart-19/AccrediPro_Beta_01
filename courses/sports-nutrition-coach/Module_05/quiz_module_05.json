            "question": "According to the Vitamin D lesson, what is the 'optimal' serum 25(OH)D range often recommended for athletes to maximize muscle protein synthesis and reduce stress fracture risk?",
            "options": [
                "20–30 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L)",
                "40–75 ng/mL (100–187 nmol/L)",
                "Over 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'sufficiency' is often defined as >30 ng/mL, athletic performance research suggests a higher 'optimal' range of 40-75 ng/mL to support bone health and type II muscle fiber function."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Why is serum magnesium often considered a 'poor' biomarker for assessing true magnesium status in athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium is only found in the hair and nails",
                "Serum levels are tightly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, representing <1% of total body magnesium",
                "Magnesium levels only fluctuate during sleep",
                "Serum magnesium levels are always higher than intracellular levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Only about 1% of body magnesium is in the blood; the body will leach magnesium from bone and muscle to maintain serum levels, masking a systemic deficiency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MMA levels rise when B12 is insufficient for cellular metabolism, making it a more sensitive and specific marker than total serum B12."
