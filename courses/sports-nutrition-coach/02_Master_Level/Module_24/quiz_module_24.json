            "question": "An athlete demonstrates a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.72 during a steady-state zone 2 run. What does this specifically indicate regarding their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "They are primarily utilizing carbohydrates as a fuel source.",
                "They are demonstrating high lipid oxidation and efficient metabolic flexibility.",
                "They are in a state of metabolic acidosis and should increase glucose intake.",
                "They have reached their anaerobic threshold and are nearing exhaustion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 to 0.75 indicates that the body is almost exclusively oxidizing fatty acids for fuel. In the context of metabolic flexibility, the ability to maintain a low RER at moderate intensities is a hallmark of an aerobic system optimized for fat metabolism."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of Bioenergetic Profiling, which energy system is the primary target for nutritional support in a track cyclist performing repeated 30-second maximal sprints with 4-minute recoveries?",
            "options": [
                "Oxidative Phosphorylation",
                "Aerobic Lipolysis",
                "Fast Glycolysis (Lactic System)",
                "Phosphocreatine (ATP-CP) System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the ATP-CP system initiates the movement, a 30-second maximal effort relies heavily on the glycolytic pathway. Precision fueling for this athlete must focus on buffering metabolic byproducts and ensuring high muscle glycogen availability."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "In the context of Chrononutrition, research suggests that the thermic effect of food (TEF) and insulin sensitivity follow a circadian rhythm. How should a Master Practitioner apply this?",
            "options": [
                "Consume 80% of total daily carbohydrates after 8:00 PM.",
                "Maintain a consistent caloric surplus regardless of time of day.",
                "Prioritize larger caloric and carbohydrate loads during daylight hours when insulin sensitivity is higher.",
                "Fast for 20 hours daily to reset the peripheral molecular clocks."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic recovery and nutrient processing are optimized during daylight hours. Studies show that insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are generally higher in the morning and afternoon compared to late evening, supporting 'front-loading' nutrition for better metabolic health."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A client undergoes nutrigenomic testing and is identified as a 'Slow Metabolizer' for caffeine (CYP1A2 'CC' genotype). What is the evidence-based recommendation for their pre-workout protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caffeine dose to 9mg/kg to overcome genetic resistance.",
                "Avoid high-dose caffeine pre-workout as it may impair performance or increase cardiovascular risk in this genotype.",
                "Caffeine metabolism is unrelated to the CYP1A2 gene.",
                "Switch to anhydrous caffeine only, as it bypasses the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CYP1A2 gene encodes the enzyme responsible for 95% of caffeine metabolism. Individuals with the 'CC' (slow) variant may experience decreased performance or increased ergolytic effects from high caffeine doses, unlike 'AA' (fast) metabolizers."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "During a 90-minute sweat test in 30°C heat, an athlete loses 1.8kg of body mass and consumes 500ml of water. What is their estimated sweat rate per hour?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 Liters/hour",
                "1.5 Liters/hour",
                "1.8 Liters/hour",
                "2.3 Liters/hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total fluid loss = (Mass loss + Fluid intake). 1.8kg (1800ml) + 500ml = 2300ml total loss. 2300ml / 1.5 hours = 1533ml, which rounds to approximately 1.5 Liters/hour."

            "question": "An elite rower's blood panel shows a Ferritin level of 22 ng/mL and a Hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL. How should the Master Practitioner interpret this data-driven result?",
            "options": [
                "These are optimal levels for an endurance athlete.",
                "The athlete is in Stage 1 Iron Deficiency (Depletion) and requires nutritional intervention and monitoring.",
                "The athlete has clinical anemia and requires immediate blood transfusion.",
                "The results are invalid because Ferritin is not a reliable marker for athletes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' clinical ranges for Ferritin often start at 12-15 ng/mL, athletic performance (especially in endurance sports) is often compromised when Ferritin drops below 30-35 ng/mL. This represents Stage 1 Iron Deficiency."

            "question": "Which Neuro-Nutrition strategy is most effective for enhancing cognitive focus and reducing 'brain fog' during the final stages of an ultra-endurance event?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose sedative herbs like Valerian root.",
                "Co-ingestion of L-Tyrosine with caffeine to support dopamine synthesis under stress.",
                "Restricting all sodium to prevent cerebral edema.",
                "Consuming only long-chain triglycerides for immediate brain fuel."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Tyrosine is a precursor to catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine). Supplementation has been shown in clinical trials to preserve cognitive function during acute physical stress and sleep deprivation, especially when combined with caffeine."

            "options": [
                "Design a stricter meal plan to ensure they get enough nutrients.",
                "Provide a psychological diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa.",
                "Refer the client to a multidisciplinary team including a licensed mental health professional and a physician.",
                "Ignore the behavior as long as the athlete's performance metrics are improving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master Practitioners must recognize the limits of their scope. Suspected eating disorders or clinical psychological issues require immediate referral to licensed medical and mental health professionals."

            "options": [
                "To maximize muscle protein synthesis through leucine triggering.",
                "To enhance the activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK pathways for mitochondrial biogenesis.",
                "To increase the rate of gastric emptying for race day.",
                "To ensure the athlete reaches peak glycogen saturation before a HIIT session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Training in a glycogen-depleted state (and recovering without carbohydrates overnight) amplifies the cell signaling pathways (AMPK, PGC-1α) that drive mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation adaptations."

            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Piperine (Black Pepper)",
                "Calcium Carbonate",
                "Fiber-rich legumes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Piperine, the active component in black pepper, inhibits the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that eliminates curcumin, significantly increasing its systemic bioavailability for anti-inflammatory benefits."
