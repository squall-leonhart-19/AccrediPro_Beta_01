            "question": "An elite marathoner demonstrates a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.72 during a steady-state zone 2 run. What does this specifically indicate regarding their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "A primary reliance on carbohydrate oxidation",
                "High metabolic flexibility with a high rate of lipid oxidation",
                "Severe metabolic inefficiency and glycogen depletion",
                "An equal 50/50 split between fat and glucose utilization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 to 0.75 indicates that the athlete is primarily utilizing free fatty acids for fuel. In a Master Practitioner context, this demonstrates high metabolic flexibility, allowing the athlete to preserve precious glycogen stores for higher intensity efforts."

            "question": "According to the principles of Chrononutrition, why might high-glycemic carbohydrate ingestion be less optimal during late-evening sessions compared to morning sessions?",
            "options": [
                "Muscle protein synthesis is deactivated after 8:00 PM",
                "Glut-4 translocation is significantly higher at night",
                "Natural insulin sensitivity decreases in the evening as melatonin levels rise",
                "Cortisol levels are at their peak in the evening, blocking glucose uptake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circadian biology dictates that insulin sensitivity typically peaks in the morning and declines toward the evening. The rise in melatonin can further impair insulin secretion, making late-night high-GI boluses less efficient for partition and recovery."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client possesses the 'Slow Metabolizer' (AC or CC) genotype for the CYP1A2 gene. Based on nutrigenomics research, how should their caffeine intake be adjusted for performance?",
            "options": [
                "They should increase caffeine dosage to 9mg/kg to overcome slow processing",
                "Caffeine should be ingested 3-4 hours prior to competition rather than 60 minutes",
                "They should avoid high-dose caffeine as it may actually decrease performance or increase cardiac stress",
                "Genetics do not influence caffeine metabolism; only habituation matters"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Guest et al., 2018) shows that for those with the 'slow' CYP1A2 genotype, high caffeine intake can be ergolytic (performance-hindering) rather than ergogenic, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular strain and impairing clearing rates."

            "question": "In Precision Hydration, if an athlete loses 1.5kg of body mass during a 60-minute session while consuming 500ml of fluid, what is their calculated sweat rate?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 Liters per hour",
                "1.5 Liters per hour",
                "2.0 Liters per hour",
                "2.5 Liters per hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sweat rate = (Pre-weight - Post-weight + Fluid Intake). Here: (1.5kg loss is 1500ml) + 500ml intake = 2000ml (or 2.0L) per hour. This is a fundamental calculation for creating precision hydration protocols."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner reviews a biomarker panel and notes a Ferritin level of 22 ng/mL in a female distance runner. What is the most evidence-based intervention?",
            "options": [
                "No action needed; this is within the 'normal' clinical reference range (>15 ng/mL)",
                "Immediate referral for a blood transfusion",
                "Increase dietary iron and consider supplementation, as performance can decline when Ferritin drops below 30-35 ng/mL",
                "Switch the athlete to a ketogenic diet to improve iron absorption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'clinically normal' might start at 15 ng/mL, athletic performance standards (specifically for endurance) suggest that Ferritin levels below 30-35 ng/mL can impair oxygen transport and aerobic capacity, necessitating nutritional intervention."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Which Neuro-nutrition strategy is most appropriate for an athlete requiring high levels of 'cognitive flexibility' and neurotransmitter replenishment during a multi-day tournament?",
            "options": [
                "High-dose sedative herbs like Valerian root during the day",
                "L-Tyrosine supplementation to provide precursors for dopamine and norepinephrine",
                "Complete elimination of dietary fats to increase brain glucose",
                "Restricting water intake to increase intracellular pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Tyrosine is a precursor to catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine). Studies suggest it is particularly effective at maintaining cognitive performance during periods of high acute stress or sleep deprivation, common in tournament scenarios."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "When implementing Nutritional Periodization, the 'Train Low' strategy (low glycogen availability) is primarily used to:",
            "options": [
                "Maximize power output during high-intensity intervals",
                "Enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulate fatty acid oxidation enzymes",
                "Ensure the athlete reaches their lowest possible body fat percentage",
                "Test the athlete's psychological 'toughness' without physiological benefit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Train Low' model (specifically the 'Sleep Low, Train Low' variant) is designed to amplify the cell signaling pathways (like AMPK) that lead to mitochondrial biogenesis and improved fat oxidation, though it is not intended for high-intensity performance sessions."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In the context of Bioenergetic Profiling, which fuel source is most critical for an athlete performing repeated 5-second maximal sprints with 20 seconds of rest?",
            "options": [
                "Exogenous glucose only",
                "Long-chain fatty acids",
                "Phosphocreatine (PCr) and anaerobic glycolysis",
                "Ketone bodies"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Short, maximal bursts rely heavily on the ATP-CP system. With short rest periods (20 seconds), the system does not fully recover, forcing a significant contribution from anaerobic glycolysis to maintain power output."

        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner identifies a client with symptoms of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), including recurring stress fractures and hormonal disturbances. What is the ethical priority?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe a high-calorie meal plan and continue training as usual",
                "Refer the client to a multidisciplinary team including a physician and/or specialized dietitian",
                "Increase the client's Vitamin D dosage to 10,000 IU and monitor for 6 months",
                "Ignore the symptoms as they are common in high-level athletics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S is a complex clinical condition involving metabolic, endocrine, and bone health issues. A Master Practitioner must recognize the limits of their scope and refer to a medical professional/MDT to ensure athlete safety."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Which combination of 'Functional Food Synergies' would best support systemic recovery and reduction of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD)?",
            "options": [
                "Processed sugar and caffeine",
                "Tart cherry juice (anthocyanins) and Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA)",
                "White bread and Vitamin C",
                "Sodium bicarbonate and beta-alanine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tart cherry juice provides potent antioxidants (anthocyanins) that reduce oxidative stress, while Omega-3s provide anti-inflammatory support. Together, they create a functional synergy that accelerates recovery from EIMD more effectively than either in isolation."
