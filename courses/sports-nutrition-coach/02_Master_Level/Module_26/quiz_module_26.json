            "question": "During the 'General Preparation Phase' of a Macro-Periodization plan, what is the primary nutritional objective for an endurance athlete?",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing glycogen stores for high-intensity intervals",
                "Improving metabolic flexibility and fat oxidative capacity",

                "Aggressive carbohydrate loading to support 10-12g/kg BM intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The General Preparation Phase (Base) focuses on building an aerobic foundation. By utilizing lower carbohydrate availability during some sessions, athletes can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and improve their ability to oxidize fat as a fuel source."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "An athlete utilizes the 'Sleep Low, Train Low' micro-cycle strategy. What is the physiological mechanism this intervention aims to upregulate?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Training in a glycogen-depleted state (and sleeping without repletion) prolongs the duration of low-glycogen signaling, which significantly increases the expression of PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "To achieve an intra-workout carbohydrate oxidation rate of 90-120g/hour, what specific formulation is required to bypass SGLT1 transporter saturation?",

                "Isotonic solution containing only Glucose and Sodium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SGLT1 transporter for glucose saturates at approximately 60g/hour. To reach higher oxidation rates, fructose must be added to utilize the GLUT5 transporter, typically in a 2:1 or 1:0.8 ratio."

                "No protein, as it interferes with Growth Hormone secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 40g of slow-digesting casein protein ingested 30 minutes before sleep is effectively digested and absorbed, providing a sustained supply of amino acids to support muscle protein synthesis throughout the night."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-alanine requires a chronic loading period to significantly increase muscle carnosine levels. The standard protocol is 4-6g/day (divided into smaller doses to avoid paresthesia) for 4-10 weeks."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total fluid loss = (Weight Loss + Fluid Intake). 1.5kg (1500ml) + 500ml = 2000ml total loss. Over 90 minutes (1.5 hours), the rate is 2000 / 1.5 = 1.33 L/h."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ferritin levels below 30 ng/mL in athletes are generally categorized as Stage 1 Iron Depletion, where iron stores are low but red blood cell production (hemoglobin) is not yet compromised."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maximize muscle glycogen supercompensation (peaking), current guidelines recommend 10-12g of carbohydrate per kg of body mass per 24 hours for the 36-48 hours before the event."
