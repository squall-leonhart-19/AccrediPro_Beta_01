            "question": "During the Specific Physical Preparation (SPP) phase of a Macro-Periodization plan, what is the primary nutritional objective for an endurance athlete?",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing hypertrophy through a 500kcal daily surplus",
                "Metabolic flexibility and training low to increase mitochondrial biogenesis",
                "Fueling high-intensity sessions to support sport-specific velocities and glycogen sparing",
                "Aggressive fat loss to reach a minimum competition weight early"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the SPP phase, training becomes more specific to the competition. Nutrition must shift to support high-intensity, sport-specific work, emphasizing glycogen availability and performance over the metabolic adaptations (like fat adaptation) often sought in the GPP phase."

            "question": "According to the 'Fuel for the Work Required' paradigm in Micro-Cycle programming, how should carbohydrates be adjusted for a 'Low' intensity recovery day?",
            "options": [
                "3-5 g/kg of body weight to maintain glycogen levels",
                "8-10 g/kg of body weight to facilitate systemic recovery",
                "0.5-1.0 g/kg of body weight to promote fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity",
                "Maintain the same intake as high-intensity days to prevent metabolic crashes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Low-intensity or recovery days typically require 3-5 g/kg of CHO. This supports basic physiological function and recovery without providing excess energy that could lead to unwanted fat gain during periods of low expenditure."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "To achieve an exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rate of 90-120g/hour during ultra-endurance events, what specific ratio of glucose to fructose is recommended?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio to maximize SGLT1 transporter saturation",
                "2:1 or 1:0.8 ratio to utilize both SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters",
                "4:1 ratio to prevent gastrointestinal distress from fructose malabsorption",
                "Only pure glucose should be used as fructose is too slow to oxidize"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SGLT1 (glucose) transporter saturates at ~60g/hr. To reach higher oxidation rates (90g+), adding fructose (which uses the GLUT5 transporter) in a 2:1 or 1:0.8 ratio is necessary to bypass the glucose bottleneck."

            "question": "A client presents with a sleep latency of 45 minutes and frequent waking. Which nutritional intervention is most supported by research to improve sleep architecture and SWS (Slow Wave Sleep)?",
            "options": [
                "High-protein meal (50g+) within 30 minutes of bed",
                "Consumption of tart cherry juice (Montmorency) 30-60 minutes before sleep",
                "A 200mg dose of anhydrous caffeine to stabilize neurotransmitters",
                "Strict water fasting for 6 hours prior to sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tart cherry juice is rich in phytochemicals and exogenous melatonin. Studies have shown it increases sleep time and efficiency by improving the melatonin-to-metabolite ratio and reducing systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-alanine increases muscle carnosine (intracellular buffer), while sodium bicarbonate increases blood bicarbonate (extracellular buffer). Together, they provide a dual-action buffering system critical for high-intensity anaerobic performance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total weight loss = 1.8kg (1800ml). Total fluid intake = 600ml. Total sweat = 1800 + 600 = 2400ml. Hourly rate = 2400ml / 1.5 hours = 1600ml/hr or 1.6 L/hr."

            "options": [
                "Optimal recovery and readiness for a PR attempt",
                "Acute systemic inflammation or inadequate recovery from recent high-intensity loading",
                "Superior cardiovascular fitness and high stroke volume",
                "A need to increase carbohydrate intake to 12g/kg immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation. Values above 3.0 mg/L in athletes (assuming no illness) suggest that the current training load is exceeding the body's recovery capacity, requiring a reduction in intensity or increase in recovery protocols."

            "options": [
                "1:1 (e.g., 100mg Caffeine : 100mg L-Theanine)",
                "1:2 (e.g., 100mg Caffeine : 200mg L-Theanine)",
                "5:1 (e.g., 500mg Caffeine : 100mg L-Theanine)",
                "L-Theanine should never be mixed with stimulants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests a 1:2 ratio of caffeine to L-theanine is optimal for enhancing alpha-wave brain activity, providing the alertness of caffeine without the associated vasoconstriction and jitteriness."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "During a 'Taper' phase (7-10 days before competition), how should the nutritional plan be adjusted relative to the previous high-volume training phase?",
            "options": [
                "Decrease total calories while maintaining high carbohydrate density to ensure glycogen saturation",
                "Increase total calories by 20% to account for 'supercompensation' energy needs",
                "Switch to a ketogenic protocol to maximize fat oxidation for the race",
                "Eliminate all sodium to reduce water retention and 'racing weight'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "As training volume drops during a taper, total energy expenditure decreases. However, maintaining high CHO intake (8-12g/kg) is vital to ensure glycogen stores are fully 'topped off' while slightly reducing total calories (mostly from fats) to prevent unnecessary weight gain."

            "question": "Which biomarker is the most sensitive indicator of early-stage iron deficiency in athletes, even before hemoglobin levels drop?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Ferritin",
                "Blood Glucose",
                "Creatine Kinase (CK)",
                "Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Serum Ferritin reflects the body's stored iron. In athletes, Ferritin levels below 30-35 ng/mL can impair performance and oxidative enzyme function even if Hemoglobin (the oxygen carrier) is still within the normal range."
