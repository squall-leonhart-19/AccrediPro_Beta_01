            "question": "A High-Performance Team (HPT) operates on the principle of 'Transdisciplinary Integration.' How is this defined in a sports nutrition context?",
            "options": [
                "The nutritionist works in isolation and sends a monthly report to the coach",
                "Each professional works separately but shares the same office space",
                "Boundaries between disciplines blur as experts co-create a unified strategy for the athlete",
                "The head coach makes all nutritional decisions based on the nutritionist's data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transdisciplinary integration involves specialists from different fields (nutrition, S&C, psychology) working together to create a single, cohesive plan rather than working in silos."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acute exposure to high altitude and environmental stress can increase BMR by 15-25% due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and the metabolic cost of acclimatization."

            "question": "When synthesizing biometric data, a Master Practitioner observes a 'Parasympathetic Overreach' characterized by a low Resting Heart Rate (RHR) but a significant decrease in Heart Rate Variability (HRV). What does this likely indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete is in peak physical condition and ready for competition",
                "The athlete is experiencing a state of non-functional overreaching",
                "The athlete is dehydrated and needs more electrolytes",
                "The athlete has successfully adapted to the current training load"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decrease in HRV despite a low RHR often signals a maladaptation to stress or non-functional overreaching, requiring an immediate adjustment in recovery protocols."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Open Window' refers to the 3 to 72-hour period following intense exercise where the immune system is temporarily suppressed, increasing susceptibility to Upper Respiratory Tract Infections."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner is faced with an athlete who wants to use a supplement that is not third-party tested but is recommended by their head coach. What is the ethically correct action?",
            "options": [
                "Allow the athlete to take it since the head coach approved it",
                "Take the supplement yourself first to see if there are side effects",
                "Advise against use, document the risk of contamination, and provide tested alternatives",
                "Ignore the situation as it falls under the coach's jurisdiction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical leadership and the Master Practitioner Capstone emphasize 'informed consent' and 'risk mitigation.' Advising against untested supplements and providing safe alternatives is a core responsibility."

                "High-fat meals in the morning and fasting in the evening",
                "High-protein breakfast to promote alertness and a higher-carbohydrate evening meal to promote serotonin/melatonin",
                "Continuous caffeine consumption throughout the 24-hour travel period",
                "Avoiding all food until the local time reaches 12:00 PM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protein-rich breakfasts stimulate dopamine/alertness, while carbohydrate-rich evening meals facilitate the entry of tryptophan into the brain, supporting melatonin production and circadian alignment."

                "Total weight lifted in a 1RM test"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sleep quality and biometrics are leading indicators because they predict future performance and recovery capacity. Body fat and competition times are lagging indicators (results of past actions)."
