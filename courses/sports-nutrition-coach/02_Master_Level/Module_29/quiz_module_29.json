            "question": "At the Master Integration level, what distinguishes a 'Transdisciplinary' approach from a 'Multidisciplinary' approach within a High-Performance Team (HPT)?",
            "options": [
                "Transdisciplinary teams work in silos with a single head coach making all final decisions.",
                "Transdisciplinary teams integrate knowledge and methods from different disciplines to create a shared conceptual framework that transcends traditional boundaries.",
                "Multidisciplinary teams share all data, whereas transdisciplinary teams only share data with the medical staff.",
                "Transdisciplinary teams focus exclusively on the physical aspects of performance, ignoring psychological variables."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A transdisciplinary approach involves team members moving beyond their specific silos to develop a holistic, shared strategy, whereas multidisciplinary teams often work alongside each other without deep integration of their methodologies."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Transition Phase is critical for systemic recovery, allowing the athlete to restore hormonal balance (e.g., cortisol/testosterone ratios) and improve metabolic flexibility after the high-carbohydrate demands of the competition phase."

            "options": [
                "Glycogen utilization decreases as the body shifts to fat oxidation for safety.",
                "There is no change in substrate utilization in multi-stressor environments.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental stressors like heat and hypoxia increase sympathetic nervous system activity and catecholamine release, which accelerates the rate of muscle glycogenolysis and overall carbohydrate oxidation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV combined with an elevated RHR is a classic physiological signal of sympathetic dominance and potential under-recovery or LEA, requiring an increase in energy availability to support the nervous system."
