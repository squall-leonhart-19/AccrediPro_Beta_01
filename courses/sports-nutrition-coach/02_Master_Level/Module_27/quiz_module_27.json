            "question": "For ultra-endurance events lasting longer than 3 hours, what is the current evidence-based recommendation for carbohydrate intake when using multi-transportable carbohydrate blends (e.g., glucose:fructose)?",
            "options": [
                "30–60 grams per hour",
                "60–70 grams per hour",
                "90–120 grams per hour",
                "150–180 grams per hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern research into 'gut training' and multi-transportable carbohydrates (using both SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters) shows that elite ultra-endurance athletes can oxidize and benefit from 90–120g of CHO per hour."

            "question": "In combat sports, to ensure complete rehydration following a rapid weight loss (RWL) protocol, what is the recommended fluid intake volume relative to the body mass lost during the 'cut'?",
            "options": [
                "100% of lost mass (1.0L per 1kg lost)",
                "125% of lost mass (1.25L per 1kg lost)",
                "150% of lost mass (1.5L per 1kg lost)",
                "200% of lost mass (2.0L per 1kg lost)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses during the rehydration period, athletes should consume 150% of the weight lost (1.5L for every 1kg of body mass deficit)."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in Masters athletes (age 60+), what is the recommended per-meal protein dose to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",

                "A flat dose of 15g regardless of weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to a blunted response to amino acids, Masters athletes require a higher leucine threshold and a larger protein bolus (0.4–0.6 g/kg) compared to younger athletes (0.25–0.3 g/kg) to trigger MPS."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Elite adolescent athletes have significantly higher calcium requirements to support peak bone mass accrual. What is the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium for athletes aged 9–18?",

                "1,800 mg/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The RDA for calcium for adolescents (9–18 years) is 1,300 mg/day, which is higher than the adult requirement of 1,000 mg/day, to support rapid skeletal growth."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "For a para-athlete with a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) at or above the T6 level, what is the most critical environmental nutrition concern during competition in the heat?",
            "options": [
                "Increased rate of glycogen depletion",
                "Impaired thermoregulation due to lack of sweating capacity below the lesion",
                "Excessive sodium loss through hyper-hidrosis",
                "Rapid vitamin D degradation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Athletes with SCI above T6 often have impaired sympathetic nervous system control, meaning they cannot sweat or redistribute blood flow effectively below the level of the injury, making them highly susceptible to overheating."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Upon arrival at high altitude (>2,500m), which metabolic shift occurs that requires an adjustment in the athlete’s macronutrient strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Increased reliance on fat oxidation at all intensities",
                "Decreased Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)",
                "Increased reliance on glucose/carbohydrate as a fuel source",
                "Reduced need for iron due to hemoconcentration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "At altitude, the body shifts toward increased carbohydrate reliance because glucose provides more ATP per mole of oxygen consumed compared to fatty acids, which is advantageous in a hypoxic environment."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "During the 'immobilization phase' of a musculoskeletal injury (e.g., limb in a cast), what protein intake range is recommended to mitigate disuse atrophy?",

                "Over 3.5 g/kg/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To counteract the 'anabolic resistance' of an immobilized limb and minimize muscle loss, protein intake should be elevated to 2.0–2.5 g/kg/day during the recovery period."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "When managing travel for a professional team moving EASTWARD across 6 time zones, what is the recommended timing for melatonin administration to facilitate a 'phase advance'?",
            "options": [
                "In the morning local time at the destination",
                "In the evening local time at the destination",
                "During the flight only",
                "Exactly 12 hours before the game"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To shift the circadian rhythm forward (phase advance) when traveling east, melatonin should be taken in the evening at the new destination to signal the body that it is time for sleep."

            "id": "q27_9",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Baar et al.) indicates that consuming 15g of collagen or gelatin with ~50mg of Vitamin C before exercise increases collagen precursors in the blood and improves tendon/ligament health."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "In the context of 'Weight Cutting' in combat sports, what is the maximum recommended percentage of body mass that can be safely lost via acute dehydration (fluid loss) to minimize performance decrements?",
            "options": [
                "2–3% of body mass",
                "5–8% of body mass",
                "10–12% of body mass",
                "15% of body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While many athletes lose 5-10%, the clinical recommendation to avoid significant physiological distress and performance decline is to limit acute fluid loss to no more than 2–3% of body mass."
