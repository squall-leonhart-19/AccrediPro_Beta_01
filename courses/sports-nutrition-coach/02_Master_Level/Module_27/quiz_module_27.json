            "question": "During a 100-mile ultra-marathon, what is the current evidence-based recommendation for carbohydrate intake when utilizing multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., glucose:fructose blends)?",
            "options": [
                "30–60 grams per hour",
                "60–75 grams per hour",
                "90–120 grams per hour",
                "150–200 grams per hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recent research in ultra-endurance sports suggests that using multiple transportable carbohydrates allows for higher oxidation rates, with 90-120g/hr being the target for elite performance in events lasting over 3 hours."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "In combat sports, 'Rapid Weight Loss' (RWL) exceeding what percentage of body mass is clinically associated with significant cardiovascular strain and impaired thermoregulation?",
            "options": [
                "2%",
                "5%",
                "8%",
                "12%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Losing more than 5% of body mass through rapid dehydration significantly reduces plasma volume, increasing heart rate and core temperature, which elevates the risk of heat illness and cardiovascular collapse."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "To overcome 'anabolic resistance' in a 65-year-old Masters athlete, what is the recommended per-meal protein dose to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "0.25 g/kg (approx. 20g)",
                "0.40 g/kg (approx. 35-40g)",
                "0.80 g/kg (approx. 60g)",
                "1.2 g/kg (approx. 90g)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Masters athletes require a higher leucine threshold to trigger MPS compared to younger athletes; 0.40 g/kg per meal (or roughly 35-40g) is needed to overcome the age-related decline in anabolic signaling."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Elite youth athletes are at high risk for the 'Female Athlete Triad' or RED-S. What percentage of peak bone mass is typically accrued by the end of adolescence (age 18-20)?",

                "99%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90% of peak bone mass is established by age 18-20, making adequate energy availability and calcium/vitamin D intake critical during the adolescent 'window of opportunity'."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Which physiological factor must a coach account for when calculating the energy requirements of a para-athlete with a high-level Spinal Cord Injury (SCI)?",
            "options": [
                "A 15-25% lower Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) due to denervated muscle mass",
                "A 50% higher RMR due to increased spasticity",
                "Increased sweat rates compared to able-bodied athletes",
                "Higher glycogen storage capacity in paralyzed limbs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Athletes with SCI generally have a lower RMR (15-25% reduction) because of the loss of metabolically active muscle mass below the level of the lesion."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "What is the minimum recommended duration for a heat acclimation protocol to achieve maximal plasma volume expansion and sweat rate adaptations?",
            "options": [
                "2–3 days",
                "5–7 days",

                "21–28 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While some adaptations occur early, it takes 10-14 days of consistent heat exposure to achieve full physiological acclimation, including expanded plasma volume and a lower shivering/sweating threshold."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "When training at high altitude (>2,500m), why is it recommended that athletes maintain serum ferritin levels >100 ng/mL prior to ascent?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent altitude sickness",
                "To support accelerated erythropoiesis (red blood cell production)",
                "To improve fat oxidation in hypoxic conditions",
                "To buffer against metabolic acidosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypoxia triggers the production of new red blood cells; if iron stores (ferritin) are low, the athlete cannot effectively increase hemoglobin mass, negating the primary benefit of altitude training."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "During the 'Immobilization Phase' following a major orthopedic surgery, what is the primary nutritional priority to mitigate muscle atrophy?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to prevent fat gain",
                "High-dose antioxidant supplementation (Vitamin C & E)",
                "Increasing protein intake to 1.6–2.5 g/kg/day",
                "Restricting protein to reduce inflammation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During immobilization, muscle becomes resistant to anabolic stimuli. High protein intake (1.6-2.5 g/kg) is necessary to mitigate the rapid muscle loss that occurs when a limb is not in use."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "When a professional team travels across multiple time zones to the East, which strategy is most effective for accelerating circadian resynchronization?",
            "options": [
                "Avoiding all sunlight upon arrival",
                "Consuming a high-protein breakfast and using evening melatonin",
                "Drinking 500mg of caffeine immediately before sleep",
                "Staying awake for 24 hours straight prior to departure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Traveling East is more difficult than West. Resynchronization is aided by morning light exposure (to advance the clock) and low-dose melatonin in the local evening to signal sleep."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Following a combat sports weigh-in, what is the optimal fluid replacement volume to ensure complete rehydration before the bout?",
            "options": [
                "50% of the body mass lost",
                "100% of the body mass lost",
                "150% of the body mass lost",
                "300% of the body mass lost"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses during the rehydration period, athletes should consume 150% of the fluid mass lost (e.g., 1.5L for every 1kg lost)."
