            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During high-intensity exercise, blood is shunted to the working muscles, reducing splanchnic (gut) blood flow by up to 80%, which triggers Exercise-Induced Gastrointestinal Syndrome (EIGS)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Managing nocturnal hypoglycemia requires a combination of basal insulin reduction and slow-release carbohydrates to compensate for the glycogen replenishment phase."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Z-score of -2.0 or lower is a clinical indicator of low bone mineral density (osteoporosis/osteopenia) and requires medical investigation within the RED-S framework."
