            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EIGS is primarily driven by the shunting of blood away from the GI tract to the working muscles and skin, leading to ischemia and increased intestinal permeability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-exercise late-onset hypoglycemia is a major risk for T1D athletes, occurring 6-15 hours after exercise as the body replenishes glycogen stores and insulin sensitivity remains elevated."
