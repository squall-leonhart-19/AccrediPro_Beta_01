            "question": "In the P.E.R.F.O.R.M. USP framework for positioning a premium brand, what does the 'R' signify, and why is it critical for sports nutritionists?",
            "options": [
                "Revenue-Focus; maximizing the profit per athlete interaction.",
                "Results-Driven; emphasizing objective performance metrics and bio-marker improvements.",
                "Retention-Strategy; focusing solely on keeping existing clients.",
                "Reach-Expansion; increasing the number of social media followers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' stands for Results-Driven. Premium athletes invest in outcomes, not just information. Demonstrating a track record of objective performance improvements (e.g., power output, recovery times) is essential for a high-level USP."

            "question": "When designing a 'High-Ticket' program architecture, what is the primary differentiator between 'Value-Based Pricing' and 'Commodity Pricing'?",
            "options": [
                "Value-Based Pricing is calculated by adding 20% to your hourly overhead.",
                "Commodity Pricing is based on the specific athletic goal, regardless of time spent.",
                "Value-Based Pricing focuses on the financial and emotional impact of the transformation for the athlete.",
                "Commodity Pricing is only used by coaches with more than 10 years of experience."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket programs use Value-Based Pricing, which prices the 'transformation' (e.g., a pro contract or a PR) rather than the hours of work. Commodity pricing (hourly) leads to burnout and lower perceived value."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case studies act as 'proof of concept.' By deconstructing the physiology and strategy used for a real client, you demonstrate expertise and allow prospects to see themselves in the success story."

                "A system where clients get a discount for referring their teammates."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Bilateral Referral Loop is a professional synergy where both parties (e.g., Coach and PT) provide complementary services, ensuring the athlete receives 360-degree care while both businesses grow organically."

                "By explaining that the coach has many certifications and is very expensive.",
                "By ignoring the objection and moving straight to the payment link."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing shifts the perspective from 'money leaving the bank' (cost) to 'capital deployed for a future return' (investment). For an athlete, the 'return' is improved performance, reduced injury risk, and potentially higher career earnings."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (often cited from Harvard Business School) shows that because the cost of acquisition is so high, a small increase in retention (LTV) has a disproportionately large impact on net profit, ranging from 25% to 95%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires that testimonials reflect what a consumer can generally expect to achieve. If the result is extraordinary, a disclosure stating that results are not typical is legally mandatory to avoid 'deceptive advertising' claims."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A product ladder allows you to monetize your 'Authority' at different price points. It builds a funnel where low-cost products build trust, eventually leading qualified athletes into your high-ticket, high-margin programs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The LTV:CAC ratio tells you if your marketing spend is sustainable. A healthy scaling business typically aims for an LTV that is at least 3x to 5x the cost of acquiring that customer."
