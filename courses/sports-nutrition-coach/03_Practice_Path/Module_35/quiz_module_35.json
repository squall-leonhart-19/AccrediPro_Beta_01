            "question": "According to the 'CEO Mindset' framework in Lesson 1, what is the primary indicator that a practitioner has successfully transitioned to a business owner?",
            "options": [
                "The practitioner is working 60+ hours per week to ensure client satisfaction.",
                "The business can generate revenue and maintain service quality without the owner's daily involvement in delivery.",
                "The practitioner has increased their hourly rate by at least 50% from the previous year.",
                "The business has moved from a home office to a commercial retail space."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CEO mindset focuses on 'working on' the business rather than 'in' it. Success is defined by building systems and teams that allow the business to scale independently of the founder's time."

            "question": "When scaling the P.E.R.F.O.R.M. Methodology™ for teams (Lesson 2), which strategy is most effective for maintaining individualization within a group setting?",

                "Requiring athletes to seek outside help for any specific nutritional adjustments."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tiered programming allows the P.E.R.F.O.R.M. Methodology™ to scale by addressing the common needs of subgroups (e.g., linemen vs. wide receivers) while maintaining a level of specificity."

            "id": "q35_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses Advanced Technology Integration. What is the 'Data Silo' problem, and how does a scaling business solve it?",
            "options": [
                "Having too much data; solved by deleting 50% of client records every quarter.",
                "Data being trapped in disconnected apps (wearables, food logs, CRM); solved by using API integrations and a centralized dashboard.",
                "Data being too accessible to competitors; solved by removing all cloud-based storage.",
                "Data being too expensive to collect; solved by switching to manual paper tracking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data silos occur when information is fragmented across different platforms. Scaling businesses use integration (APIs) to create a 'Single Source of Truth' for athlete performance data."

            "options": [
                "Value-based pricing is always cheaper than commodity pricing to attract more volume.",
                "Commodity pricing is based on the results achieved, while value-based is based on hours worked.",
                "Value-based pricing is based on the perceived and actual ROI for the athlete, while commodity pricing is based on market averages for time.",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in sports nutrition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing decouples time from money, focusing on the economic or performance impact of the transformation (e.g., securing a professional contract) rather than an hourly rate."

                "Employees should only work 70% of the time to avoid burnout.",
                "You should keep 70% of the profit and pay the team 30%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 70% Rule is a leadership principle used to overcome the 'perfectionism trap,' allowing the CEO to delegate tasks even if the execution isn't initially identical to their own, facilitating business growth."

            "id": "q35_9",
            "question": "A key business metric mentioned in the module is the LTV:CAC ratio. If a client's Lifetime Value (LTV) is $3,000 and the Cost Per Acquisition (CAC) is $500, what is the ratio and what does it indicate?",

            "id": "q35_10",
            "question": "In a B2B case study from Lesson 5, a coach partners with a local CrossFit box. Instead of individual coaching, they offer a 'Challenge' model. What is the primary scaling advantage of this model?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'One-to-Many' model (group challenges/programs) is the cornerstone of scaling, as it allows the coach to serve 20-50+ people in the same time it would take to serve one, dramatically increasing revenue per hour."
