            "question": "When transitioning from a Practitioner to a CEO mindset, what is the primary shift required regarding the allocation of 'High-Value' time?",
            "options": [
                "Moving from 80% client delivery to 80% administrative tasks",
                "Shifting from 'working in' the business to 'working on' the business through strategic delegation",

                "Eliminating all client contact to focus exclusively on marketing analytics"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CEO mindset requires the practitioner to stop being the 'bottleneck' of the business. This involves shifting focus toward strategy, systems, and leadership (working on the business) rather than just individual service delivery (working in the business)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaling the P.E.R.F.O.R.M. Methodology™ for teams requires efficiency through technology. Using automated aggregation allows the coach to see the team's status as a whole while still being able to drill down into individual athlete data for personalized interventions."

            "explanation": "Predictive analytics uses historical and real-time data (like HRV and sleep patterns) to identify trends, allowing the coach to intervene proactively before a performance drop-off or injury occurs, which is a high-value 'CEO-level' insight."

                "Value-based pricing (Pricing based on the ROI and transformation of the outcome)",
                "Competitor-matching pricing (Charging $5 less than the local average)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket offers are engineered around the 'Value-Based' model, where the price reflects the significant impact, time saved, and specific performance outcomes provided to the client, rather than the number of hours spent."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Land and Expand' strategy is a common B2B tactic where a practitioner secures a small initial contract (the 'Land') and uses the successful data and outcomes from that group to secure a larger, organization-wide contract (the 'Expand')."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 3 and 10' (coined by Hiroshi Mikitani) suggests that everything in a business changes and often breaks when you reach multiples of 3 and 10 (e.g., 3 employees, 10 employees, 30 employees), necessitating new leadership structures and SOPs."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SOPs are the 'playbook' of the business. They ensure that even when the founder is not directly involved, the service quality remains high and consistent, which is essential for scaling without reputation damage."
