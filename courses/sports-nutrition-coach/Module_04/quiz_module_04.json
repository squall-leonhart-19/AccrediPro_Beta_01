            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which enzyme serves as the rate-limiting step for fatty acid entry into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1)",
                "Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL)",
                "Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL)",
                "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "CPT-1 is the gatekeeper enzyme that facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. Its activity determines the rate at which fats can be oxidized during exercise."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to research on inflammation management, what is the recommended daily combined dosage of EPA and DHA for athletes to significantly reduce markers of DOMS and improve recovery?",
            "options": [
                "500 mg - 1,000 mg",
                "1,000 mg - 1,500 mg",
                "2,000 mg - 3,000 mg",
                "5,000 mg - 7,000 mg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that higher doses of Omega-3 fatty acids (2.0 to 3.0 grams of combined EPA/DHA) are required to modulate the inflammatory response and provide neuroprotective benefits compared to general health guidelines."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A major 'reality' of long-term keto-adaptation in elite endurance athletes is the downregulation of which enzyme complex, potentially limiting high-intensity glycolytic performance?",
            "options": [
                "Citrate Synthase",
                "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)",
                "Creatine Kinase",
                "Succinate Dehydrogenase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While keto-adaptation increases fat oxidation rates, it often leads to 'metabolic inflexibility' by downregulating the PDH complex, which impairs the athlete's ability to efficiently utilize glycogen for high-intensity efforts (sprints or climbs)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that fat intakes below 20% of total energy can lead to a decline in circulating testosterone and other steroid hormones, as cholesterol is a necessary precursor for their synthesis."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "What is the 'Athlete’s Paradox' regarding Intramuscular Triglycerides (IMTG)?",
            "options": [
                "Athletes have very low IMTG stores despite high fat intake.",
                "Athletes have high IMTG stores similar to Type 2 diabetics, but maintain high insulin sensitivity.",
                "Athletes utilize IMTGs only during anaerobic sprinting.",
                "IMTGs are only found in Type II fast-twitch fibers in athletes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Athlete's Paradox' describes the observation that both highly trained endurance athletes and sedentary individuals with Type 2 diabetes have elevated IMTG stores, but athletes utilize them efficiently for fuel while maintaining high insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) are unique compared to Long-Chain Triglycerides (LCTs) because they:",
            "options": [
                "Are absorbed via the lymphatic system.",
                "Require carnitine to enter the mitochondria.",
                "Enter the portal vein directly and are transported to the liver.",
                "Have a higher caloric density (12 kcal/g)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MCTs (C6-C12) bypass the lymphatic system and are absorbed directly into the portal circulation, allowing for faster oxidation. However, they must be used cautiously to avoid gastrointestinal distress."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for the delayed gastric emptying observed after a high-fat meal?",

                "Leptin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fat in the duodenum triggers the release of CCK, which slows gastric emptying to allow more time for emulsification and digestion. This is why high-fat meals are avoided immediately before high-intensity performance."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Peak Fat Oxidation (FatMax) typically occurs at which exercise intensity range for most moderately trained individuals?",

                "Above 90% VO2 max"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FatMax, the intensity at which the highest rate of fat oxidation (g/min) occurs, is generally found in the moderate-intensity zone of 45-65% VO2 max, though this can be shifted higher with aerobic training."

            "question": "In the case study of an ultra-endurance runner, why might the coach increase the MUFA (Monounsaturated Fatty Acid) ratio over PUFAs during the lead-up to a race?",
            "options": [
                "MUFAs are more prone to oxidation during storage.",
                "MUFAs are more stable and less susceptible to lipid peroxidation during high oxidative stress.",
                "MUFAs inhibit the absorption of glucose.",
                "MUFAs are the only fat source that can be stored as IMTG."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High intakes of highly polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) can increase the risk of lipid peroxidation during the extreme oxidative stress of ultra-endurance events. MUFAs (like those in olive oil) offer a more stable fuel source."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "During a 4-hour cycling bout at 60% VO2 max, approximately what percentage of total energy expenditure is derived from IMTGs in a fat-adapted athlete?",

                "Less than 5%",
                "10% - 15%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In endurance-trained athletes, IMTGs can contribute significantly to total energy expenditure, typically providing between 20% and 40% of the energy during moderate-intensity exercise, sparing glycogen for later use."
