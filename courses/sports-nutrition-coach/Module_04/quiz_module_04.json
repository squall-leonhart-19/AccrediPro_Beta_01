            "options": [
                "Any whole food that provides basic caloric needs for energy balance.",
                "Foods that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition, specifically targeting physiological pathways like vasodilation or recovery.",
                "Synthetic supplements designed to replace whole food groups during the competitive season.",
                "Foods that are exclusively organic and non-GMO, regardless of their nutrient density."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional foods in the PERFORM™ Method are defined by their ability to modulate specific physiological systems (like the cardiovascular or immune systems) beyond simple macronutrient and micronutrient provision."

                "2000mg of nitrates consumed immediately upon waking on race day.",
                "Nitrates should only be consumed post-exercise to aid in muscle reoxygenation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that peak plasma nitrite levels occur approximately 2-3 hours after ingestion, with a dosage of 6.4–12.8 mmol (roughly 400-800mg) being most effective for enhancing mitochondrial efficiency."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-muscle axis suggests that probiotics can improve performance by producing SCFAs, which serve as an energy source and modulate systemic inflammation, thereby improving endurance and body composition."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study (Wankhede et al.) found that 300mg of Ashwagandha twice daily led to significantly greater increases in muscle strength on the bench press and leg extension, as well as significantly greater muscle size and reduced recovery time."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3s integrate into the phospholipid bilayer of muscle cells, enhancing the sensitivity of the muscle to anabolic stimuli (protein intake/exercise) and increasing the phosphorylation of mTORC1."

            "question": "Why does the PERFORM™ Method prioritize 'Phyto-nutrient' antioxidants (like those in blueberries) over high-dose isolated Vitamin C and E supplements for athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Isolated vitamins are toxic in any amount to athletes.",
                "Whole-food phyto-nutrients support the body's endogenous antioxidant system without blunting the hormetic training response.",

                "Isolated vitamins are not absorbed at all by the human digestive tract."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High doses of isolated antioxidants (C & E) can interfere with ROS-signaling pathways necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis, whereas phyto-nutrients provide a more balanced 'hormetic' effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Piperine (black pepper) can increase the bioavailability of curcumin by up to 2,000% by inhibiting the metabolic pathway (glucuronidation) that otherwise eliminates curcumin rapidly."
