            "question": "Within the PERFORM™ Method framework, what is the primary distinction of a 'Functional Food' compared to standard nutritive foods?",
            "options": [
                "It contains only macronutrients required for basic survival.",
                "It provides physiological benefits beyond basic nutrition, specifically targeting performance or recovery pathways.",
                "It must be a synthetic supplement regulated by the FDA.",
                "It is any food that contains more than 20 grams of protein per serving."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional foods are defined by their ability to provide health and performance benefits—such as improved vasodilation or reduced inflammation—that exceed the value of their basic macro and micronutrient content."

            "question": "To maximize the ergogenic effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on vasodilation and mitochondrial efficiency, when should it be consumed?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately (5 minutes) before the start of exercise.",
                "2–3 hours prior to exercise to allow for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by oral bacteria.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peak plasma nitrite levels typically occur 2–3 hours after ingestion. This window allows time for the enterosalivary circulation process where oral bacteria convert nitrate into nitrite, eventually becoming nitric oxide."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SCFAs like butyrate and propionate, produced from the fermentation of functional fibers, can enter systemic circulation and improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha has robust clinical evidence supporting its role in lowering cortisol levels and enhancing power output and muscle strength when used alongside a resistance training program."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An Omega-3 Index (EPA+DHA in red blood cell membranes) of >8% is associated with reduced inflammation, better structural integrity of cells, and potential neuroprotective benefits in contact sports."

                "It makes the athlete feel more fatigued immediately.",
                "It may blunt the necessary ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) signaling required for mitochondrial biogenesis and training adaptations.",
                "It increases the rate of protein breakdown in the liver.",
                "It has no effect on the body whatsoever."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While functional foods are beneficial, excessive isolated antioxidant supplements can interfere with hormesis—the process where small amounts of oxidative stress from exercise signal the body to adapt and get stronger."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
