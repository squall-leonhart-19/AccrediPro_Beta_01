            "question": "According to the physiology of glycogen resynthesis, what is the maximum average rate at which muscle glycogen can be restored per hour when optimal carbohydrate intake is provided?",
            "options": [
                "2-3% per hour",
                "5-7% per hour",
                "10-12% per hour",
                "15-20% per hour",
                "25% per hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that even under optimal conditions (1.2g/kg/hr of CHO), the body can only resynthesize glycogen at a rate of approximately 5-7% per hour, meaning a full recovery of depleted stores takes 20-24 hours."

            "question": "To maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) via the mTORC1 pathway, what is the specific 'Leucine Threshold' typically required for a 75kg athlete?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.5 - 2.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "5.0 - 6.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The leucine threshold is the specific amount of the amino acid leucine required to 'trigger' the protein synthetic machinery. For most athletes, this sits between 2.5g and 3.0g per serving."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "An athlete loses 2.0 kg of body mass during a high-intensity training session in the heat. According to the 'Rehydrate' pillar of the 3 Rs, how much fluid should they consume during the recovery period?",
            "options": [
                "1.0 Liter (50% of loss)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses after exercise, guidelines recommend consuming 125-150% of the fluid volume lost (1.25L - 1.5L per kg lost). 2kg x 1.5 = 3.0L."

                "Over 2,000mg per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses show that 250-300ml of tart cherry concentrate (providing ~300-600mg of anthocyanins) twice daily for 5-7 days prior to and 48h after an event significantly reduces DOMS and speeds strength recovery."

            "question": "In the context of Circadian Nutrition, why is a 30-40g dose of Casein protein recommended specifically before sleep?",
            "options": [
                "It has a higher leucine content than whey",
                "It forms a gel in the stomach, providing a slow-release of amino acids over 6-8 hours",
                "It directly stimulates the release of melatonin from the pineal gland",
                "It reduces the core body temperature to induce deeper REM sleep"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Casein is a slow-digesting protein that provides a sustained 'drip' of amino acids throughout the night, maintaining a positive net protein balance during the long fasting window of sleep."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "During a multi-day tournament with only 4 hours between matches, which nutritional strategy is most effective for rapid glycogen resynthesis?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming 0.8g/kg/hr of carbohydrate only",

                "Consuming 1.2g/kg/hr of a glucose-fructose blend (2:1 ratio)",
                "Consuming high-fat meals to spare remaining glycogen"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A glucose-fructose blend utilizes both SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters in the gut, allowing for higher total carbohydrate absorption and faster resynthesis than glucose alone, especially when the recovery window is <8 hours."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creatine Kinase is an enzyme that leaks into the bloodstream when muscle fibers are damaged. It is widely used in elite sports to monitor the magnitude of EIMD (Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage)."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "If an athlete cannot reach the optimal carbohydrate intake of 1.2g/kg/hr for recovery, what intervention has been shown to 'bridge the gap' and stimulate similar glycogen resynthesis rates?",
            "options": [
                "Co-ingesting 0.3g/kg of protein with a lower dose of carbohydrate (0.8g/kg)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When CHO intake is sub-optimal (<1.0g/kg/hr), adding protein (0.3g/kg) enhances the insulin response, which can increase the rate of glycogen resynthesis to levels comparable to higher CHO intakes."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "An athlete is experiencing a decrease in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and an increase in resting heart rate over 3 consecutive days. What does this physiological trend suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete is becoming more aerobically fit",
                "The athlete is in a state of sympathetic dominance and may be under-recovered",

                "The athlete's glycogen stores are fully saturated"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decrease in HRV (reduced beat-to-beat variation) indicates a shift toward Sympathetic Nervous System dominance, a hallmark sign of acute fatigue and inadequate recovery."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which specific micronutrient is critical for recovery due to its role in over 300 enzymatic reactions, including muscle relaxation and the regulation of the sleep-inducing neurotransmitter GABA?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is vital for neuromuscular relaxation and sleep quality. It acts as an agonist for GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps 'quiet' the nervous system for recovery."
