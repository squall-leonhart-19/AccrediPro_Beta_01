            "question": "In the '3 Rs' framework of recovery, what is the scientifically recommended fluid replacement volume to compensate for sweat loss during exercise?",
            "options": [
                "100% of the body mass lost (1.0L per 1kg lost)",
                "125% of the body mass lost (1.25L per 1kg lost)",
                "150% of the body mass lost (1.5L per 1kg lost)",
                "200% of the body mass lost (2.0L per 1kg lost)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses following exercise, athletes should consume approximately 150% of the fluid volume lost (1.5L for every 1kg of body mass lost) to ensure complete rehydration."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "To maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) during the 'Repair' phase, what is the specific 'Leucine Trigger' threshold required for most athletes?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 - 1.0 grams",
                "1.5 - 2.0 grams",
                "2.5 - 3.0 grams",
                "5.0 - 6.0 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a leucine dose of 2.5 to 3.0 grams is typically required to saturate the mTORC1 pathway and maximally trigger muscle protein synthesis post-exercise."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "During the 'Refuel' phase, what is the optimal rate of carbohydrate ingestion to maximize glycogen resynthesis when the recovery window is short (<4 hours)?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 g/kg body weight per hour",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For rapid refueling (e.g., between tournament matches), a carbohydrate intake of 1.2g/kg/hr is recommended to maximize the rate of glycogen resynthesis through insulin-independent and insulin-dependent pathways."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A 2012 meta-analysis suggested that high-dose antioxidant supplementation (e.g., 1000mg Vitamin C) during recovery may be counterproductive because it:",
            "options": [
                "Increases the risk of gastrointestinal distress",
                "Blunts the adaptive signaling response to exercise, such as mitochondrial biogenesis",
                "Competes with protein transporters in the small intestine",
                "Causes excessive vasodilation, slowing nutrient delivery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While antioxidants manage inflammation, excessive exogenous doses can quench the reactive oxygen species (ROS) required as signals for training adaptations, effectively 'blunting' the benefits of the workout."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "If an athlete is unable to consume the recommended 1.2g/kg/hr of carbohydrate, which strategy has been shown to achieve similar glycogen resynthesis rates?",
            "options": [
                "Adding 0.3-0.4 g/kg of protein to a lower carbohydrate dose (0.8g/kg/hr)",
                "Consuming medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) with the carbohydrate",
                "Taking a high dose of caffeine (8mg/kg)",
                "Drinking ice-cold water to increase metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When carbohydrate intake is sub-optimal (e.g., 0.8g/kg/hr), adding 0.3-0.4g/kg of protein can stimulate additional insulin secretion, which enhances glycogen resynthesis to levels comparable to higher CHO intakes."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Based on circadian nutrition principles, what is the recommended dose and type of protein to consume 30-60 minutes before sleep to optimize overnight recovery?",
            "options": [
                "10-15g of Whey protein",

                "No protein; only carbohydrates should be consumed before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pre-sleep ingestion of 30-40g of Casein protein is recommended because its slow-digesting nature provides a sustained release of amino acids, maintaining Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) throughout the overnight fasting period."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Which physiological marker, often measured via wearable technology, is considered a gold standard for assessing Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) recovery?",

                "Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures the variation in time between heartbeats. A higher HRV typically indicates parasympathetic dominance (recovery), while a significant drop suggests sympathetic over-drive or systemic fatigue."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Circadian Nutrition,' why is late-night high-fat, high-calorie feeding discouraged for athletes?",
            "options": [
                "It causes immediate muscle atrophy",
                "It can shift the circadian clock and impair sleep quality by raising core body temperature",
                "Fat inhibits the absorption of all post-workout protein",
                "It leads to a mandatory 5% decrease in VO2 max the following day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Large, metabolically demanding meals late at night can interfere with the natural drop in core body temperature required for deep sleep and can disrupt circadian rhythms, ultimately impairing hormonal recovery."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Tart cherry juice is frequently recommended in recovery protocols due to its high concentration of which phytonutrient?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tart cherry juice is rich in anthocyanins, which have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that have been shown to reduce Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) and accelerate strength recovery."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "During a multi-event tournament (e.g., 3 games in 2 days), which 'Refuel' strategy is most critical to prevent cumulative performance decline?",
            "options": [
                "Fasted training between matches",
                "Aggressive carbohydrate loading of 10-12g/kg/day",
                "Focusing exclusively on electrolyte tablets without calories",
                "Reducing total calorie intake to prevent 'heaviness'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In tournament scenarios, the primary goal is to prevent the progressive depletion of glycogen stores. High carbohydrate intakes (up to 10-12g/kg/day) are necessary to restore energy between repeated high-intensity efforts."
