            "question": "An athlete consumes a food with a Glycemic Index (GI) of 70, containing 30g of available carbohydrates in a standard serving. What is the calculated Glycemic Load (GL) for this serving?",
            "options": [
                "21",
                "2.3",
                "40",
                "210"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Glycemic Load is calculated as (GI x grams of carbohydrate) / 100. In this case, (70 x 30) / 100 = 21. A GL above 20 is considered high."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In a well-trained 75kg male athlete, what is the typical combined storage capacity of muscle and liver glycogen?",
            "options": [
                "100-200 grams",
                "2,000-2,500 grams",
                "500-600 grams",
                "800-1,000 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Typically, muscle glycogen accounts for ~400-500g and liver glycogen for ~80-100g in a trained individual, totaling roughly 500-600g (approx. 2,000-2,400 kcal)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-intensity efforts rely heavily on Type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibers, which have a high glycolytic capacity and depend on muscle glycogen for rapid ATP production."

            "id": "q3_4",

                "Consuming a high-GI liquid carbohydrate during a 30-minute recovery run",
                "Performing a morning steady-state session in a fasted state to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis",
                "Carbohydrate loading 24 hours before a high-intensity track workout",
                "Consuming 90g of carbs per hour during a 4-hour cycling event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Train Low' strategy involves performing specific training sessions with low carbohydrate availability (e.g., fasted morning cardio) to trigger metabolic adaptations like increased fat oxidation and mitochondrial efficiency."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Reactive hypoglycemia (rebound hypoglycemia) is most likely to occur in sensitive athletes if simple carbohydrates are consumed in which timeframe?",
            "options": [
                "15-45 minutes before the start of exercise",

                "During the middle of a long-distance event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Consuming simple sugars 15-45 minutes pre-exercise can cause a spike in insulin; when exercise starts, the 'insulin-like effect' of muscle contraction combined with high circulating insulin can cause blood glucose to drop precipitously."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "For an ultra-endurance athlete competing for over 2.5 hours, what is the recommended carbohydrate intake rate and composition to maximize absorption?",
            "options": [
                "30g/hour of glucose only",
                "60g/hour of fructose only",

                "120g/hour of complex starch only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intake exceeding 60g/hour requires 'multiple transportable carbohydrates' (glucose and fructose) to utilize both SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters, allowing for up to 90g/hour (or more in trained guts)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern carbohydrate loading protocols recommend 10-12g of carbohydrate per kg of body mass per 24 hours in the 36-48 hours preceding an endurance event to maximize glycogen stores."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Why is a 'low-residue' (low fiber) diet often recommended for the 24 hours immediately preceding a major endurance competition?",
            "options": [
                "To increase the Glycemic Index of all meals",
                "To prevent the fermentation of fiber and reduce the risk of GI distress/bloating",
                "To slow down the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream",
                "To ensure the athlete reaches a state of ketosis faster"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing fiber (residue) minimizes the volume of undigested matter in the gut, reducing the likelihood of 'runner's trots,' bloating, and emergency bathroom stops during high-intensity endurance efforts."

                "Phosphofructokinase (PFK)",
                "Hexokinase",
                "Glycogen Synthase",
                "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycogen synthase is the primary enzyme responsible for converting glucose to glycogen. Its activity is highest immediately post-exercise due to glycogen depletion and increased insulin sensitivity."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "An athlete is performing two high-intensity training sessions in one day, separated by only 4 hours. What is the priority for their carbohydrate intake between sessions?",
            "options": [
                "High-fiber, low-GI carbohydrates to provide sustained release",
                "Immediate intake of 1.0-1.2g/kg/hr of high-GI carbohydrates",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the recovery window is <8 hours, rapid resynthesis is critical. Consuming 1.0-1.2g/kg/hr of high-GI carbohydrates immediately post-exercise optimizes the 'rapid phase' of glycogen replenishment."
