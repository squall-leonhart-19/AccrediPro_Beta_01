            "question": "In the P.E.R.F.O.R.M. protocol for Strength and Power athletes (L1), what is the recommended protein distribution to maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) for hypertrophy?",
            "options": [
                "0.25g/kg per meal across 3 meals",
                "0.40g - 0.55g/kg per meal across 4-5 meals",
                "1.0g/kg per meal across 2 meals",
                "0.8g/kg total per day regardless of timing"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maximize MPS in hypertrophy-focused athletes, the PERFORM protocol emphasizes a distribution of 0.40-0.55g/kg per meal across 4-5 feeding windows to maintain the 'leucine trigger' throughout the day."

            "question": "For ultra-endurance athletes (L2), what is the current 'gold standard' carbohydrate intake range per hour for events lasting longer than 2.5 hours?",
            "options": [
                "30-60g per hour",
                "60-90g per hour",
                "90-120g per hour (using multiple transportable carbohydrates)",
                "Over 150g per hour"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that ultra-endurance athletes can oxidize up to 90-120g of carbohydrates per hour when using a glucose-to-fructose ratio (typically 1:0.8 or 2:1) to utilize different intestinal transporters."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In Team Sports (L3), the 'E' factor (Energy) is often compromised by 'congested fixtures.' What is the primary focus for glycogen replenishment during a 48-hour turnaround?",
            "options": [
                "High-fat ketogenic dieting to spare glucose",
                "Immediate post-match intake of 1.2g/kg/hr of carbohydrates for the first 4 hours",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In intermittent team sports with short recovery windows, rapid glycogen replenishment is critical. Consuming 1.2g/kg/hr of carbohydrates immediately post-match is the evidence-based protocol for maximizing resynthesis rates."

                "Loss of >10% body mass in 24 hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many combat athletes exceed this, literature suggests that losing more than 5% of body mass through acute dehydration (RWL) significantly increases the risk of heat illness, cognitive decline, and reduced strike force."

                "To acutely upregulate leptin levels and metabolic rate",
                "To ensure the athlete remains in a caloric deficit",
                "To decrease the thermic effect of food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Refeeds involve a temporary increase in carbohydrate intake to help reverse the hormonal adaptations of dieting, specifically targeting the upregulation of leptin and thyroid hormones (T3)."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When adapting the PERFORM method for Youth Athletes (L6), why is the 'M' (Micronutrient) factor specifically focused on Calcium and Vitamin D?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adolescence is a critical window for bone mineral density. The PERFORM protocol for youth prioritizes Calcium (1,300mg/day) and Vitamin D to ensure long-term skeletal health and prevent stress fractures."

            "options": [
                "It should be lower (1g) to avoid kidney strain",
                "It should be the same (2g)",
                "It should be higher (approx. 3-4g) to trigger the same MPS response",
                "Leucine is not effective for Master athletes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master athletes require a higher 'leucine trigger' (typically 3-4g per meal, or 0.4g/kg protein) to overcome the age-related decline in the muscle's sensitivity to amino acids."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "During the Mid-Luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (L8), how does the Female Athlete's metabolism shift according to the PERFORM method?",
            "options": [
                "Increased reliance on carbohydrates and lower core temperature",
                "Lower metabolic rate and increased protein synthesis",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the mid-luteal phase, progesterone rises, which increases BMR and promotes fat oxidation, but also increases protein breakdown, requiring a slight increase in both caloric and protein intake."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis cited in the course regarding Master Athletes found that combining protein supplementation with resistance training resulted in how much more lean mass compared to training alone?",
