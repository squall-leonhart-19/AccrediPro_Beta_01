            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "According to the Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) model, which range is considered the 'sweet spot' for minimizing injury risk while maximizing fitness gains?",
            "options": ["0.5 to 0.8", "0.8 to 1.3", "1.5 to 2.0", "Over 2.5"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research by Gabbett et al. suggests that an ACWR of 0.8 to 1.3 is the 'sweet spot' where injury risk is lowest. Ratios above 1.5 represent a 'danger zone' for increased injury risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "An athlete presents with a significant decrease in the Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD) over three consecutive days. What does this likely indicate regarding their autonomic nervous system?",
            "options": ["Increased parasympathetic activity (improved recovery)", "Increased sympathetic dominance (stress/fatigue)", "Optimal metabolic flexibility", "High glycogen availability"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RMSSD is a primary marker of parasympathetic (vagal) tone. A decrease in RMSSD indicates parasympathetic withdrawal and a shift toward sympathetic dominance, signaling the athlete is under-recovered."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 3 demonstrated that restricting sleep to 4-5 hours per night for just one week can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "30-40%", "60-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Short-term sleep deprivation (4-5 hours/night) has been shown to reduce insulin sensitivity by 30-40%, significantly impairing glucose metabolism and glycogen resynthesis in athletes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In the context of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), what is the clinically recognized threshold for 'Low Energy Availability' (LEA) in female athletes that results in endocrine disruption?",
            "options": ["<45 kcal/kg FFM/day", "<30 kcal/kg FFM/day", "<20 kcal/kg FFM/day", "<1,200 total calories/day"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy Availability (EA) below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the threshold where significant disruptions to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and bone health occur."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "When analyzing blood biomarkers for an endurance runner, a Ferritin level of 22 ng/mL is identified. How should a Sports Nutrition Coach interpret this value?",
            "options": ["Optimal for high-altitude training", "Stage 1 Iron Deficiency (Depleted Stores)", "Iron Deficiency Anemia", "Normal physiological range for athletes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' clinical ranges for Ferritin often go as low as 12-15 ng/mL, athletic guidelines (e.g., Sim et al.) suggest that levels below 30 ng/mL represent Stage 1 Iron Deficiency, which can impair aerobic capacity."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "During a 'High Volume/High Intensity' training phase (Periodization), what is the recommended carbohydrate intake range to support recovery and performance?",
            "options": ["3-5 g/kg body weight", "5-7 g/kg body weight", "8-12 g/kg body weight", "Carbohydrates should remain constant"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During high-intensity or high-volume phases (e.g., 2-3 hours of training/day), carbohydrate needs escalate to 8-12 g/kg of body weight to maintain glycogen stores and prevent non-functional overreaching."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Using the Session RPE (sRPE) method, if an athlete performs a 90-minute training session and rates the intensity as an 8 on the Borg CR-10 scale, what is the calculated internal load?",
            "options": ["72 units", "98 units", "720 units", "900 units"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal load is calculated as Intensity (RPE) x Duration (minutes). Therefore, 8 (RPE) x 90 (minutes) = 720 units."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "An athlete’s HRV is within their normal baseline, but they report a Subjective Wellness score of 2/5 for 'Muscle Soreness' and 2/5 for 'Mood.' What is the most appropriate nutritional adjustment?",
            "options": ["Aggressive calorie deficit to reduce inflammation", "Increase Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) and tart cherry juice intake", "No adjustment needed since HRV is normal", "Immediately stop all carbohydrate intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subjective wellness markers often precede HRV changes. Low scores for soreness and mood suggest the need for anti-inflammatory support (Omega-3s, polyphenols) and potentially a slight increase in carbohydrate to support serotonin production."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between Non-Functional Overreaching (NFOR) and Overtraining Syndrome (OTS)?",
            "options": ["NFOR involves weight gain; OTS involves weight loss", "NFOR requires days of rest; OTS requires weeks", "NFOR recovery takes weeks; OTS recovery can take months or years", "OTS only affects elite male athletes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NFOR is characterized by a stagnation or decrease in performance that requires several weeks of rest/recovery. OTS is a more severe multi-system failure that often requires months or even years of recovery."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In the Lesson 8 Case Study, the athlete's mid-season pivot was triggered by a 3% loss in body mass and a plateau in power output. What was the successful intervention?",
            "options": ["Decreasing protein to 1.2g/kg", "Implementing a 'High-Low' carb periodization with a 500 kcal surplus on training days", "Switching to a ketogenic diet to improve fat oxidation", "Increasing training volume to 'break through' the plateau"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pivot involved moving from a static intake to a periodized 'High-Low' carbohydrate approach and increasing total energy intake (500 kcal surplus on training days) to restore energy availability and support power output."
