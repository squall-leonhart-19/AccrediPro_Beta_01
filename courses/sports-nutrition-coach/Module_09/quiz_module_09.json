            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "According to the P.E.R.F.O.R.M. protocol for strength athletes (L1), what is the specific 'Leucine Threshold' required per meal to maximally trigger Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": ["1.0 - 1.5 grams", "2.5 - 3.0 grams", "5.0 - 7.0 grams", "0.5 grams per kg of body weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of leucine per meal is required to reach the 'leucine trigger' point, which optimizes the mTORC1 signaling pathway for muscle hypertrophy."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2 (Endurance), for events lasting longer than 2.5 hours, what is the recommended intake of multiple transportable carbohydrates (glucose:fructose) to optimize the 'O' (Oxidation) factor?",
            "options": ["30-60g per hour", "60-90g per hour", "90-120g per hour", "150-200g per hour"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maximize carbohydrate oxidation and minimize GI distress in ultra-endurance, a ratio of glucose to fructose allows for absorption through different transporters (SGLT1 and GLUT5), supporting rates of 90-120g/hour."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "For team sport athletes (L3), the 'M' factor (Micronutrients) emphasizes sodium replacement. A 2021 study on elite soccer players found that 'salty sweaters' can lose how much sodium per liter of sweat?",
            "options": ["Less than 200mg", "500mg", "Over 1,500mg", "Exactly 1,000mg"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-intensity intermittent athletes can be 'salty sweaters,' losing upwards of 1,500mg of sodium per liter, which necessitates personalized hydration strategies to prevent cramping and cognitive decline."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Combat Sports (L4), when tracking results under pressure, what is the maximum recommended 'Acute Weight Loss' (AWL) via dehydration to ensure performance is not compromised during the bout?",
            "options": ["1% of body mass", "2-3% of body mass", "5-7% of body mass", "10% of body mass"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While many fighters lose more, evidence suggests that losing more than 2-3% of body mass through acute dehydration significantly impairs aerobic capacity, cognitive function, and 'chin' (resistance to impact)."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Lesson 5 discusses functional foods for aesthetic athletes. Which strategy is most effective for managing the 'E' (Energy) factor during a deep caloric deficit (contest prep)?",
            "options": ["Increasing liquid calories for fast absorption", "Utilizing 'Volume Eating' with low-energy-density, high-fiber foods", "Removing all fats to save calories", "Consuming only 2 large meals per day"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To manage extreme hunger during contest prep, aesthetic athletes utilize high-volume, low-calorie functional foods (like leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables) to trigger gastric stretch receptors and increase satiety."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "When adapting the PERFORM method for Youth Athletes (L6), what is the primary 'R' (Recovery) priority to prevent the Female Athlete Triad or RED-S?",
            "options": ["High-dose caffeine supplementation", "Strict ketogenic dieting", "Ensuring Energy Availability (EA) stays above 45 kcal/kg FFM/day", "Limiting protein to 0.8g/kg"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For developing athletes, maintaining Energy Availability (EA) above 45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass per day is critical for hormonal health, bone mineral density, and normal growth trajectories."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Master Athletes (L7) face 'Anabolic Resistance.' To overcome this, how should their per-meal protein dose be adjusted compared to younger athletes?",
            "options": ["Decreased to 0.2g/kg to protect the kidneys", "Kept exactly the same (0.25g/kg)", "Increased to 0.40 - 0.60g/kg per meal", "Replaced entirely with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) powders"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Master athletes require a higher per-meal protein bolus (0.4-0.6g/kg) to overcome age-related anabolic resistance and successfully stimulate muscle protein synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, during the Mid-Luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, how should a female athlete's nutrition be adjusted?",
            "options": ["Lower calorie intake due to decreased metabolism", "Increase carbohydrate and electrolyte intake to account for higher core temperature and glycogen sparing", "Perform a 24-hour fast to reset hormones", "Eliminate all protein to manage bloating"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the mid-luteal phase, an increase in progesterone raises core temperature and increases metabolic rate. Athletes often benefit from increased carbohydrates and fluid/sodium due to changes in substrate utilization."

            "question": "A 95kg Rugby player (Team Sport - L3) is focusing on the 'E' factor (Energy Density). During a heavy pre-season week, what is his likely carbohydrate requirement?",
            "options": ["2-3g/kg body mass", "6-10g/kg body mass", "Exactly 50g per day", "Carbohydrates are not necessary for rugby"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-intensity intermittent team sports like rugby require significant glycogen stores. During heavy training or pre-season, requirements typically range from 6-10g/kg of body mass."

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "In the context of Combat Sports (L4), after a weigh-in, how much fluid should an athlete consume for every 1kg of body mass lost during the 'cut'?",
            "options": ["500ml", "1 Liter", "1.5 Liters", "3 Liters"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To account for ongoing obligatory urine losses during rehydration, athletes should consume 150% of the fluid lost (1.5L for every 1kg lost) to achieve a state of euhydration."
