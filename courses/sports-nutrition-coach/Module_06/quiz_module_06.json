            "question": "According to the Results Tracking Framework (L1), which three data categories must be 'triangulated' to ensure a comprehensive view of an athlete's progress?",
            "options": [
                "Body weight, Caloric intake, and Sleep duration",
                "Objective metrics, Subjective biofeedback, and Performance data",
                "DEXA scans, Blood biomarkers, and Genetic testing",
                "Social media engagement, Body image, and Coach intuition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective tracking requires the triangulation of objective data (weight/scans), subjective biofeedback (mood/hunger), and performance metrics (strength/endurance) to see the full picture."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "When using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) for body composition analysis, what is the standard technical error of measurement (TEM) that coaches must account for?",
            "options": [
                "0.1% to 0.5%",
                "1% to 2%",
                "5% to 7%",
                "10% or more"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DEXA is highly accurate but still carries a TEM of approximately 1-2%. Changes smaller than this may be measurement error rather than actual tissue change."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "An athlete's 'Power-to-Weight Ratio' is a critical performance metric. If a cyclist weighs 75kg and produces 300 watts at threshold, what is their ratio, and how would a 2kg fat loss (maintaining power) affect it?",
            "options": [
                "4.0 W/kg; it would increase to 4.11 W/kg",
                "0.25 W/kg; it would decrease to 0.23 W/kg",
                "4.0 W/kg; it would stay the same",
                "5.0 W/kg; it would increase to 5.2 W/kg"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "300W / 75kg = 4.0 W/kg. If weight drops to 73kg (300/73), the ratio increases to 4.11 W/kg, improving climbing efficiency."

            "question": "In the context of monitoring recovery (L4), a consistent decline in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) alongside an increase in Resting Heart Rate (RHR) typically indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Improved aerobic fitness and cardiovascular efficiency",
                "Successful metabolic adaptation to a low-carb diet",
                "Accumulated systemic fatigue and sympathetic nervous system dominance",
                "Dehydration only, with no impact on the central nervous system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lower HRV and higher RHR are classic signs of a stressed autonomic nervous system, suggesting the athlete is not recovering from the training load."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'gold standard' for identifying Stage 1 Iron Deficiency in athletes, even before hemoglobin levels drop?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Albumin",
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",
                "Serum Ferritin",
                "Blood Glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Serum Ferritin reflects stored iron. In athletes, levels below 30 ng/mL often indicate depletion that can impair performance, even if the athlete is not yet clinically anemic."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "A 'true' metabolic plateau (L6) is generally defined as a stagnation in progress lasting at least how long, assuming 100% nutrition adherence?",
            "options": [
                "3 to 5 days",
                "7 days",
                "14 to 21 days",
                "6 weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to water weight fluctuations and hormonal cycles, a plateau is only confirmed after 2-3 weeks (14-21 days) of no movement in the trend line."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "When 'The Pivot' (L7) is required because an athlete is losing significant lean mass during a cutting phase, what is the recommended first nutritional adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Increase cardio duration to 60 minutes daily",
                "Decrease protein intake to 1.2g/kg",
                "Increase daily calories by 10-15% and verify protein is at 2.2g/kg+",
                "Switch to a ketogenic diet to spare muscle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Losing lean mass suggests an excessive deficit or insufficient protein. Increasing calories slightly and ensuring high protein (2.2g/kg or higher) is the standard corrective action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "What is the primary limitation of using wrist-worn wearables for tracking 'Calories Burned' (TDEE) in professional sports nutrition?",
            "options": [
                "They cannot measure heart rate accurately",
                "They have a high mean absolute percentage error (20-40%+) for energy expenditure",
                "They are too expensive for most elite athletes",
                "They only track steps and not swimming or cycling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show most wearables are highly inaccurate for TDEE, often overestimating or underestimating by 20-40%. They should be used for trends, not absolute caloric prescription."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "An athlete presents with low energy, recurring stress fractures, and suppressed testosterone/estrogen. Which condition should the coach screen for using results tracking data?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperthyroidism",
                "Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)",
                "Excessive Protein Consumption Syndrome",
                "Acute Vitamin C Toxicity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RED-S occurs when Energy Availability (EA) is too low to support physiological function, leading to hormonal, bone, and metabolic dysfunction."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Which statistical method is most effective for a coach to use when filtering out 'noise' from daily weight fluctuations?",
            "options": [
                "Comparing the highest weight of the week to the lowest",
                "Using a 7-day rolling average to identify the weight trend",
                "Only weighing the athlete once per month",
                "Ignoring weight and using only visual 'mirror' assessments"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 7-day rolling average (or mean) smooths out daily fluctuations caused by hydration, glycogen, and inflammation, providing a clearer view of the actual weight trend."
