            "question": "An elite athlete is concerned about accidental doping from contaminated supplements. Which third-party certification specifically tests for over 280 substances banned by WADA and is the only testing program required by the MLB and NHL?",
            "options": [
                "USP (United States Pharmacopeia) Verified",
                "NSF Certified for Sport",
                "Informed Choice (Standard)",
                "GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) Seal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While several organizations provide testing, the NSF Certified for Sport program is the most rigorous, specifically screening for 280+ banned substances and is the gold standard required by major professional sports leagues."

            "question": "When implementing a 'loading phase' for Creatine Monohydrate to rapidly saturate muscle phosphocreatine stores, what is the standard evidence-based protocol?",
            "options": [
                "5g per day for 30 days",
                "10g per day for 14 days",
                "20g per day (split into 4 doses) for 5-7 days",
                "0.5g per kg of bodyweight for 3 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows that 20g per day (or 0.3g/kg), divided into four 5g doses for 5-7 days, is the most effective way to achieve rapid muscle saturation before moving to a 3-5g maintenance dose."

            "question": "A 400m sprinter experiences 'paresthesia' (tingling sensation) after taking a 3.2g dose of Beta-Alanine. How should a coach adjust the protocol while maintaining the ergogenic benefit of carnosine buffering?",
            "options": [
                "Switch to L-Carnosine supplements instead of Beta-Alanine",
                "Divide the total daily dose into smaller increments of 0.8g to 1.6g throughout the day",
                "Discontinue use as this indicates an allergic reaction",
                "Take the supplement only on non-training days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paresthesia is a harmless side effect of Beta-Alanine. Dividing the dose into smaller amounts (1.6g or less) or using a sustained-release formulation effectively mitigates the sensation while still allowing for the cumulative carnosine-buffering effect."

            "question": "According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), what is the optimal dosage range for caffeine to elicit an ergogenic effect in most athletes?",
            "options": [
                "1-2 mg/kg of body mass",
                "3-6 mg/kg of body mass",
                "7-9 mg/kg of body mass",
                "10-15 mg/kg of body mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The weight of evidence suggests that 3-6 mg/kg of body mass is the 'sweet spot' for performance enhancement. Higher doses (>9 mg/kg) do not typically provide additional benefits and increase the risk of adverse effects like jitters and insomnia."

            "question": "Why is L-Citrulline Malate often preferred over L-Arginine for increasing Nitric Oxide (NO) production and improving vasodilation?",
            "options": [
                "L-Arginine is toxic to the liver in high doses",
                "L-Citrulline bypasses first-pass splanchnic extraction, leading to higher circulating Arginine levels",
                "L-Citrulline is a direct precursor to Nitric Oxide, whereas Arginine is not",
                "L-Arginine only works in anaerobic conditions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Arginine undergoes significant degradation in the gut and liver (splanchnic extraction). L-Citrulline bypasses this process and is converted into Arginine in the kidneys, resulting in higher and more sustained plasma Arginine levels than Arginine supplementation itself."

            "options": [
                "Whey Protein Isolate (20g)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Micellar Casein forms a 'gel' in the stomach, resulting in a slow, steady release of amino acids over 6-8 hours. Consuming 30-40g before sleep has been shown to maintain elevated MPS rates throughout the night."

            "options": [
                "It acts as a central nervous system stimulant",
                "High concentrations of anthocyanins reduce lipid peroxidation and inflammation",
                "It increases the rate of glycogen resynthesis by 50%",
                "It provides essential electrolytes like sodium and potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tart cherry juice is rich in phytochemicals, specifically anthocyanins, which possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that reduce the oxidative stress and muscle damage associated with intense endurance exercise."

            "options": [
                "In highly trained powerlifters during a surplus",
                "In athletes during a standard maintenance phase",
                "In individuals in highly catabolic states, such as extreme caloric deficits or bed rest",
                "In endurance athletes during a carbohydrate loading phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HMB is a metabolite of Leucine that is primarily anti-catabolic. While its effects in well-trained athletes in a surplus are negligible, it is highly effective at preventing muscle protein breakdown (MPB) during periods of high stress, injury, or aggressive calorie restriction."

                "400mg Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a mandatory co-factor for the enzymes (prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase) that cross-link collagen fibers. Ingesting collagen with Vitamin C 60 minutes before loading the tissue (exercise) maximizes delivery to the target area."

            "options": [
                "A label that lists 'Micellar Casein' as the primary ingredient",
                "A 'Proprietary Blend' that hides the specific dosages of active ingredients",
                "A label that specifies the exact amount of Creatine Monohydrate",
                "The presence of a 'Batch Number' and 'Expiration Date'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proprietary blends allow manufacturers to hide the exact amounts of ingredients, often 'fairy dusting' expensive effective ingredients while filling the product with cheap stimulants or fillers. Transparent labeling is a requirement for evidence-based practice."
