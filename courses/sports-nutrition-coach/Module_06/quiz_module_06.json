            "question": "According to the AccrediPro Results Framework, which of the following is considered a 'Lagging Indicator' of nutritional success?",
            "options": [
                "Daily Heart Rate Variability (HRV) trends",
                "Weekly Mean Body Weight (WMBW)",
                "Pre-workout glucose levels",
                "Subjective hunger and satiety scores"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body weight is a lagging indicator because it reflects the cumulative effect of previous nutritional and training inputs over time, whereas HRV and glucose are leading indicators of immediate physiological state."

            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 2 highlighted that Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) can fluctuate by what percentage based solely on hydration status?",
            "options": [
                "Up to 1%",
                "Up to 3%",
                "Up to 8%",
                "Up to 15%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 notes that hydration status can shift BIA readings by as much as 8%, making standardized testing conditions (fasted, hydrated, same time of day) critical for accuracy."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "When monitoring 'Internal Load,' an athlete presents with a high Session RPE (9/10) but a significantly lower-than-normal heart rate during submaximal efforts. This mismatch often indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Improved aerobic efficiency",
                "Acute glycogen depletion",
                "Parasympathetic overreaching",
                "Dehydration-induced stroke volume reduction"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parasympathetic overreaching (a stage of overtraining) often manifests as a 'muted' heart rate response where the athlete cannot reach peak heart rates despite high perceived exertion."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which biomarker ratio is most sensitive for detecting Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) before bone mineral density is affected?",

                "Creatinine to BUN ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lowered T3 levels in the presence of elevated or normal cortisol is a primary metabolic defense mechanism against low energy availability (LEA), serving as a precursor to more severe RED-S symptoms."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In the context of 'The Pivot' (Lesson 7), if an elite athlete's performance plateaus but body composition is moving in the desired direction, the first adjustment should be:",
            "options": [
                "A 20% reduction in total calories",
                "A re-allocation of macronutrients (e.g., increasing peri-workout carbs) without changing total calories",

                "Implementing a 7-day complete fast"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If body composition is improving but performance is stalling, the issue is likely nutrient timing or specific macronutrient availability (usually carbohydrates) rather than total energy balance."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "What is the 'Smallest Worthwhile Change' (SWC) typically used in elite sports to determine if a performance improvement is statistically significant?",
            "options": [
                "0.2 times the between-subject standard deviation",
                "0.5 times the mean of the total population",
                "Exactly 5% of the previous baseline",
                "Any change greater than the margin of error of the equipment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The SWC is defined as 0.2 of the between-subject standard deviation, allowing coaches to distinguish between random noise and genuine performance progress."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "An athlete's HRV (RMSSD) has trended downward for 4 consecutive days, and their 'Ready' score is 40% below baseline. According to Lesson 4, what is the appropriate nutritional intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Increase caffeine intake to mask fatigue",
                "Reduce carbohydrate intake to trigger metabolic stress",
                "Increase micronutrient density and potentially increase caloric intake to maintenance if in a deficit",
                "No nutritional change is needed; only training volume should be adjusted"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent low HRV indicates sympathetic dominance and poor recovery. Nutritional support should focus on reducing systemic stress by ensuring adequate energy availability and micronutrient support."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A 'True Plateau' in fat loss for an athlete is defined in Module 6 as no change in scale weight or body measurements for a minimum of how many days?",
            "options": [
                "3 days",
                "7 days",
                "14-21 days",
                "30 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to water retention and glycogen fluctuations, a plateau cannot be confirmed until 14-21 days of data show no movement in weight or circumferences."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Which technology integration provides the highest level of 'External Load' data for a field-based athlete (e.g., soccer player)?",
            "options": [
                "Smart Scales with BIA",
                "Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM)",
                "GPS Tracking Units (e.g., Catapult or STATSports)",
                "Sleep tracking rings (e.g., Oura)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GPS tracking units measure external load (distance, sprints, accelerations), while the other options measure internal biological responses or body composition."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When adjusting a plan for an athlete experiencing 'Metabolic Adaptation,' what is the recommended 'Reverse Dieting' increment for caloric intake per week?",
            "options": [
                "50-100 kcal or a 2-5% increase",
                "500-800 kcal or a 20% increase",
                "Immediately jumping to 4,000 kcal regardless of previous intake",
                "Increasing protein only by 50g per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 recommends a conservative increase of 2-5% of total calories (or 50-100 kcal) per week to restore metabolic rate while minimizing excessive fat gain."
