            "question": "When implementing the 'Sleep Low, Train Low' macronutrient periodization strategy, what is the primary physiological goal intended to enhance endurance adaptations?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize muscle glycogen storage for the following day's high-intensity session",
                "To upregulate p38 MAPK and AMPK signaling pathways for mitochondrial biogenesis",
                "To decrease the rate of fatty acid oxidation during submaximal exercise",
                "To prevent the elevation of cortisol during early morning training sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sleep Low' strategy involves a high-intensity session in the evening to deplete glycogen, followed by restricted carbohydrate intake overnight and a low-intensity session the next morning. This prolonged state of low glycogen availability significantly upregulates key signaling proteins like AMPK and p38 MAPK, which are critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic efficiency."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "During high-intensity interval training (HIIT), the phosphocreatine (PCr) system is the primary energy source. According to bioenergetic principles, what is the estimated time required for 90% resynthesis of PCr stores during passive recovery?",
            "options": [
                "30 to 60 seconds",
                "90 to 120 seconds",
                "180 to 300 seconds",
                "15 to 20 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PCr resynthesis follows a biphasic kinetic pattern. While the initial fast phase occurs quickly, it typically takes approximately 180 to 300 seconds (3-5 minutes) of passive recovery to achieve ~90% resynthesis of intramuscular PCr stores."

            "question": "In the context of the Chronobiology of Recovery, how does late-night consumption of a high-glycemic index carbohydrate meal affect sleep architecture and subsequent performance?",
            "options": [
                "It increases sleep latency and reduces REM sleep cycles",
                "It may decrease sleep latency but potentially disrupts growth hormone secretion patterns",
                "It has no measurable effect on sleep but increases morning cortisol",
                "It exclusively improves deep sleep (N3) while reducing sleep duration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While high-GI carbohydrates can shorten sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) due to increased tryptophan transport, the resulting insulin spike can suppress the natural nocturnal rise of growth hormone, potentially impacting long-term recovery and tissue repair."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "For an athlete in the 'Immobilization Phase' of an ACL injury, what is the recommended daily protein intake to mitigate muscle atrophy and maintain nitrogen balance?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 - 1.4 g/kg body weight",
                "1.6 - 1.8 g/kg body weight",
                "2.0 - 2.5 g/kg body weight",
                "Over 3.5 g/kg body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During immobilization, muscle protein breakdown (MPB) increases and 'anabolic resistance' occurs. Higher protein intakes of 2.0 to 2.5 g/kg, distributed evenly throughout the day, are required to stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) sufficiently to slow the rate of atrophy."

            "question": "According to the Energy Availability (EA) framework, what is the clinical threshold below which an athlete is at high risk for metabolic adaptation and hormonal dysfunction (RED-S)?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "30 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "20 kcal/kg Total Weight/day",
                "15 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently indicates that an Energy Availability (EA) below 30 kcal per kilogram of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the threshold where the body begins to downregulate non-essential physiological functions, leading to the symptoms associated with Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)."

            "question": "Which specific mechanism explains why high-intensity exercise in heat often leads to 'leaky gut' or increased intestinal permeability in athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) in the colon",
                "Splanchnic hypoperfusion (shunting of blood away from the gut) leading to epithelial damage",
                "Oversaturation of SGLT1 transporters by glucose",
                "Rapid increase in Bifidobacterium populations causing mucosal irritation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During high-intensity exercise, especially in heat, blood is shunted away from the gastrointestinal tract to the working muscles and skin for thermoregulation. This splanchnic hypoperfusion leads to ischemia, which damages the tight junctions of the gut lining, increasing intestinal permeability."

            "question": "When considering Micronutrient Synergy, why is the co-ingestion of Vitamin C and non-heme iron particularly important for female endurance athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C converts ferric iron (Fe3+) to the more absorbable ferrous iron (Fe2+)",
                "Vitamin C blocks the inhibitory effects of Hepcidin on iron transport",
                "Vitamin C increases the storage capacity of Ferritin in the liver",
                "Vitamin C reduces the excretion of iron through sweat and urine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Non-heme iron (found in plant sources) is less bioavailable than heme iron. Vitamin C acts as a reducing agent, converting ferric iron (Fe3+) to the more soluble and absorbable ferrous iron (Fe2+) in the acidic environment of the stomach."

            "question": "Under the PERFORM Method™, if an athlete presents with recurring URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infections) and gastrointestinal distress during races, which pillar should the coach prioritize first?",
            "options": [
                "P - Periodization",
                "E - Energy Availability",
                "F - Functional Gut & Micronutrients",
                "M - Metabolic Efficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'F' in PERFORM stands for 'Functional Gut & Micronutrients.' Recurring URTIs often signal a compromised immune system linked to gut health or micronutrient deficiencies (like Vitamin D or Zinc). Addressing the microbiome and nutrient density is the direct intervention for these specific symptoms."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in Lesson 5 found that for every 10% reduction in body mass during a weight loss phase, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) often drops by approximately 15-20%. This phenomenon is known as:",
            "options": [
                "The Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) surge",
                "Adaptive Thermogenesis",
                "Hypermetabolic response",
                "Substrate Utilization Shift"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive Thermogenesis is the process where the body reduces its metabolic rate beyond what can be explained by the loss of body mass (FFM and Fat Mass) alone, as a survival mechanism to preserve energy during a deficit."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "For an elite cyclist performing a 4-hour moderate-intensity training ride, what is the evidence-based carbohydrate intake recommendation to maintain performance and prevent glycogen depletion?",
            "options": [
                "30g per hour (Glucose only)",
                "60g per hour (Glucose only)",
                "90g per hour (Multiple Transportable Carbohydrates)",
                "120g per hour (Fructose only)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For exercise lasting longer than 2.5 to 3 hours, intakes up to 90g per hour are recommended. This requires a mix of multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and fructose in a 2:1 or 1:0.8 ratio) to utilize both SGLT1 and GLUT5 transporters, as the SGLT1 transporter becomes saturated at ~60g/hour."
