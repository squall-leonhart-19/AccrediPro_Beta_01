            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Macronutrient Periodization, what is the primary molecular signaling pathway activated during 'Train Low' (low glycogen) sessions to promote mitochondrial biogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)",
                "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)",
                "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)",
                "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Low glycogen availability increases the AMP:ATP ratio, which activates AMPK. This leads to the upregulation of PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Regarding Bioenergetics, what is the estimated time required for the complete resynthesis of intramuscular Phosphocreatine (PCr) stores following exhaustive high-intensity exercise?",
            "options": [
                "30-60 seconds",
                "2-3 minutes",
                "5-10 minutes",
                "20-30 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 50% of PCr is typically resynthesized within 30-60 seconds, full recovery of PCr stores can take between 5 to 10 minutes depending on the acidity (pH) of the muscle environment."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the Chronobiology of Recovery, which nutritional intervention has been shown in clinical trials to significantly increase exogenous melatonin levels and improve sleep efficiency in elite athletes?",
            "options": [
                "500mg of Magnesium Citrate before bed",
                "High-glycemic index carbohydrates 4 hours before bed",
                "30ml of Tart Cherry Juice concentrate twice daily",
                "20g of Casein protein 30 minutes before bed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tart cherry juice (specifically Montmorency) contains high concentrations of phytochemicals and exogenous melatonin, which research shows improves sleep duration and quality in athletes."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "During the 'Immobilization Phase' of an injury, what is the recommended daily protein intake to mitigate the effects of anabolic resistance and muscle atrophy?",
            "options": [
                "0.8 - 1.2 g/kg body weight",
                "1.4 - 1.6 g/kg body weight",
                "2.3 - 3.1 g/kg body weight",
                "Over 4.0 g/kg body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To counteract 'anabolic resistance' during immobilization, protein requirements increase significantly. Intakes between 2.3 and 3.1 g/kg are recommended to preserve lean mass while energy expenditure is reduced."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "A female triathlete presents with recurring stress fractures and irregular menses. Her calculated Energy Availability (EA) is 25 kcal/kg FFM/day. This value is:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal for performance and health",
                "Adequate for weight loss without metabolic risk",

                "Above the threshold for hormonal disruption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The clinical threshold for Low Energy Availability (LEA) is generally recognized as 30 kcal/kg Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day. Values below this are associated with impaired bone health and endocrine function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA), produced by the fermentation of prebiotic fibers in the gut, is the primary fuel source for colonocytes and plays a critical role in maintaining the intestinal barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Butyrate",
                "Acetate",
                "Propionate",
                "Valerate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the preferred energy source for the cells lining the colon (colonocytes). It is essential for maintaining the 'tight junctions' of the gut barrier, especially during the heat stress of exercise."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Why is it strategically advantageous to avoid iron supplementation in the 3-6 hour window immediately following high-intensity training?",
            "options": [
                "Exercise increases insulin, which blocks iron transport",
                "Post-exercise elevation of the hormone hepcidin inhibits iron absorption",
                "Iron competes with Vitamin C for absorption during the recovery window",
                "Sweat loss continues for hours, wasting the supplemental iron"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exercise triggers an inflammatory response that increases hepcidin levels. Hepcidin blocks ferroportin, the protein that exports iron into the blood, significantly reducing absorption for several hours post-workout."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "In the PERFORM Method™, the 'E' stands for Energy Systems. Which of the following is a primary focus when programming for a 'Glycolytic' athlete?",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing fat oxidation at VO2 max",
                "Optimizing lactate clearance and intra-muscular buffering capacity",
                "Restricting all carbohydrates to improve metabolic flexibility",
                "Focusing exclusively on Vitamin D for bone density"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Athletes relying on the glycolytic system produce significant hydrogen ions. Nutritional strategies for these athletes focus on buffering (e.g., beta-alanine, sodium bicarbonate) and glycogen replenishment."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis discussed in the module suggests that 'Train-High, Sleep-Low' protocols may improve performance by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing fat oxidation while maintaining the ability to perform high-intensity intervals",
                "Reducing the need for protein during the recovery phase",
                "Eliminating the need for a taper period before competition",
                "Increasing the rate of gastric emptying"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Train-High (performing high-intensity work with full stores) followed by Sleep-Low (sleeping with low glycogen) allows for the high-intensity stimulus while extending the duration of the low-glycogen signaling window overnight."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "To maximize collagen synthesis for an athlete returning from an ACL injury, when is the most effective time to ingest 15g of gelatin/collagen paired with Vitamin C?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately upon waking",
                "60 minutes prior to the rehabilitation or loading session",
                "During the rehabilitation session",
                "Exactly 2 hours after the session is completed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Baar et al.) shows that consuming collagen/gelatin 60 minutes before exercise allows the amino acids to peak in the blood exactly when the loading stimulus is applied to the connective tissue, doubling collagen synthesis rates."
