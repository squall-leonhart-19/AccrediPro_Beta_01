            "options": [
                "It reduces the amount of continuing education required",
                "It allows the practitioner to command 20-40% higher rates due to perceived specialist expertise",
                "It eliminates the need for professional liability insurance",
                "It guarantees a 100% conversion rate during discovery calls"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialization creates a 'perceived expertise' premium. Data suggests specialists can command significantly higher rates (often 20-40% more) than generalists because they solve specific, high-value problems for a defined population."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Before taking on clients, legal and professional protection is paramount. Securing insurance and clearly defining your Scope of Practice protects both the practitioner and the client from a clinical and legal standpoint."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, the 'Value-Based Pricing' model is presented as superior to hourly billing. What is the psychological reason for this?",
            "options": [
                "Clients prefer paying small amounts frequently",
                "Hourly billing punishes efficiency and focuses the client on cost rather than the transformation",
                "It is easier to calculate taxes with value-based pricing",
                "Value-based pricing is always cheaper for the client in the long run"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hourly billing creates a conflict of interest where the client wants the result quickly (less pay for you) and the practitioner is incentivized to work slowly. Value-based pricing aligns both parties toward the outcome/transformation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Founding Member program offers a discounted rate in exchange for honest feedback and testimonials, helping the practitioner build the 'social proof' necessary to attract full-price clients later."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anchor pricing uses a high-end option to set a mental benchmark for value. When a client sees a $3,000 package first, a $1,200 package feels like a significant value by comparison."
