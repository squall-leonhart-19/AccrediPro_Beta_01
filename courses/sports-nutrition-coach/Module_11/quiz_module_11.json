            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is often preferred in athletic settings because it provides a '3-compartment model' of body composition. What are these three compartments?",
            "options": [
                "Water, Fat, and Muscle",
                "Bone Mineral Content, Fat Mass, and Lean Soft Tissue",
                "Subcutaneous Fat, Visceral Fat, and Skeletal Muscle",
                "Intracellular Water, Extracellular Water, and Total Body Fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DEXA differentiates between bone mineral content (BMC), fat mass, and lean soft tissue (which includes muscle and organs), making it more detailed than 2-compartment models like skinfolds or underwater weighing."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the 2014 systematic review by Helms et al., what is the recommended protein intake for lean, resistance-trained athletes in a caloric deficit to maximize muscle retention?",
            "options": [
                "1.2 to 1.7 g/kg of total body weight",
                "1.8 to 2.2 g/kg of total body weight",
                "2.3 to 3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass",
                "3.5 to 4.0 g/kg of fat-free mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The research suggests that as body fat levels decrease and the caloric deficit remains, protein needs increase to 2.3-3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass to protect against lean mass catabolism."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In the context of hypertrophy nutrition, why is a 'controlled surplus' (approx. 250-500 kcal) generally recommended over an aggressive 'dirty bulk' for advanced trainees?",
            "options": [
                "Advanced trainees have a lower 'P-ratio' meaning they gain fat more easily",
                "The rate of muscle protein synthesis potential decreases as an athlete approaches their genetic ceiling",
                "Aggressive surpluses inhibit the mTOR pathway",
                "High-calorie diets reduce the thermic effect of food (TEF)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced trainees have a limited capacity for further muscle growth. An aggressive surplus beyond what is needed for this slow rate of growth results in disproportionate fat gain rather than additional muscle."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "The 'MATADOR' study (Minimizing Adaptive Thermogenesis and Deactivating Obesity Rebound) demonstrated that which strategy resulted in greater fat loss and better maintenance of Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)?",
            "options": [
                "Continuous energy restriction for 16 weeks",
                "Intermittent dieting with 2-week blocks of restriction followed by 2-week 'diet breaks' at maintenance",
                "A 5:2 fasting approach where calories were restricted only two days per week",
                "Daily carbohydrate refeeds during a continuous 16-week deficit"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MATADOR study showed that 2-week diet breaks (maintenance calories) helped mitigate the drop in RMR and led to significantly more total fat loss compared to continuous dieting."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism behind 'Adaptive Thermogenesis' (often incorrectly called 'Starvation Mode') during prolonged weight loss?",
            "options": [
                "The complete shutdown of the thyroid gland",
                "A permanent metabolic damage that prevents future weight loss",
                "A reduction in TDEE that exceeds what can be accounted for by the loss of body mass",
                "The conversion of white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adaptive thermogenesis refers to the body becoming more efficient, where the drop in Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is greater than predicted by the reduction in body weight alone, largely driven by decreases in NEAT and hormonal shifts."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A physique competitor is 4 weeks post-show and experiencing extreme hunger, low libido, and lethargy. What is the most evidence-based approach for their 'Off-Season' transition?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain 'stage lean' body fat for as long as possible to improve insulin sensitivity",
                "Implement a 'Recovery Diet' to rapidly increase calories and restore hormonal homeostasis",
                "Stay in a slight deficit to ensure no fat is gained during the transition",
                "Perform high-intensity steady-state cardio (HIIT) daily to offset the increased calories"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Recovery Diet' focuses on bringing the athlete back to a healthy physiological 'settling point' by increasing calories and body fat to restore the HPG axis and thyroid function."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the difference between 'Disordered Eating' and a clinical 'Eating Disorder' in athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Disordered eating only occurs in females, while eating disorders occur in both genders",
                "Disordered eating involves abnormal eating patterns that do not meet the full diagnostic criteria for a clinical disorder like Anorexia or Bulimia",
                "There is no difference; the terms are used interchangeably in sports nutrition",
                "Eating disorders are always characterized by low body weight, whereas disordered eating is not"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disordered eating is a descriptive term for a range of irregular eating behaviors (like restrictive dieting or bingeing) that may be harmful but do not meet the specific DSM-5 clinical criteria for a diagnosed eating disorder."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When performing body recomposition (losing fat and gaining muscle simultaneously), which population is MOST likely to see significant results?",
            "options": [
                "Elite Olympic weightlifters with 10+ years of experience",
                "Physique competitors in the final 2 weeks of contest prep",
                "Novice trainees with high body fat percentages or those returning from a long training hiatus",
                "Endurance runners who have reached their peak VO2 max"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recomposition is most achievable in 'untrained' individuals or those with significant 'muscle memory' (returning from a break), as the stimulus for muscle protein synthesis is much higher relative to their current state."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A carbohydrate refeed (increasing carbs to maintenance or slightly above for 24-48 hours) is primarily intended to acutely increase which hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Glucagon",
                "Leptin",
                "Ghrelin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Carbohydrate intake is a primary driver of leptin secretion. Short-term refeeds can temporarily boost leptin levels, which may help signal to the brain that the body is not 'starving,' potentially improving metabolic rate and satiety."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is known to be highly sensitive to which variable, often leading to inaccurate readings in athletes?",
            "options": [
                "Ambient room temperature",
                "Hydration status and glycogen storage",
                "The athlete's height",
                "The time of day the measurement is taken"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BIA measures the resistance of electrical flow through body tissues. Since muscle is high in water and fat is low, changes in hydration status or glycogen (which holds water) can significantly skew the results."
