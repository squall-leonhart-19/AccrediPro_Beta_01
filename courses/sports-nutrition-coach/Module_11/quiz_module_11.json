            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "During a 30-second maximal sprint, at approximately which point does the energy contribution from anaerobic glycolysis typically surpass that of the phosphagen (ATP-CP) system?",
            "options": [
                "2-3 seconds",
                "6-10 seconds",
                "15-20 seconds",
                "25-30 seconds"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the phosphagen system is dominant for the first few seconds, anaerobic glycolysis ramps up rapidly and typically becomes the primary energy contributor between 6 and 10 seconds into a maximal effort."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In the context of nutritional periodization, how should the macronutrient profile typically shift when moving from a Hypertrophy phase to a Peak Strength phase?",
            "options": [
                "Increase total calories and increase protein to 3.0g/kg.",
                "Decrease total calories to a deficit while maintaining low carbohydrates.",
                "Maintain high glycogen availability while slightly reducing the total caloric surplus to manage body composition.",
                "Shift to a ketogenic diet to optimize fat oxidation for power output."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strength phases require high neurological demand and glycogen availability for intensity, but because total volume is often lower than hypertrophy phases, the caloric surplus is usually moderated to prevent unnecessary fat gain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to clinical guidelines for Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), what is the 'danger zone' threshold for Energy Availability (EA) where physiological dysfunction is highly likely?",
            "options": [
                "Below 45 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "Below 30 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "Below 20 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "Exactly 35 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that an Energy Availability below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the critical threshold for the disruption of metabolic rate, bone health, and reproductive function."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which micronutrient synergy is specifically required for the enzyme lysyl oxidase to cross-link collagen fibers, ensuring structural integrity of tendons and ligaments?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D and Calcium",
                "Vitamin C and Copper",
                "Magnesium and Zinc",
                "Vitamin K2 and Manganese"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase, while Copper is a mandatory cofactor for lysyl oxidase, which cross-links collagen and elastin in connective tissues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Why does the body increase its reliance on carbohydrate oxidation (glucose) over fatty acid oxidation at high altitudes (>2,500m)?",
            "options": [
                "Glucose yields more ATP per unit of oxygen consumed than fat.",
                "Fat stores are depleted faster in cold environments.",
                "The body cannot digest fats at high altitudes due to low pressure.",
                "Insulin sensitivity decreases at altitude, forcing glucose use."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Carbohydrate oxidation is more 'oxygen-efficient' than fat oxidation, producing more ATP for every molecule of oxygen used, which is a critical adaptation in hypoxic (low oxygen) environments."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "To optimize the 'Circadian Nutrition' of an athlete, which strategy is most effective for improving sleep latency and quality?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-fat meal 30 minutes before bed.",
                "Restricting all carbohydrates after 2:00 PM.",
                "Consuming a high-protein meal rich in tryptophan combined with moderate-GI carbohydrates 2-4 hours before sleep.",
                "Drinking 500ml of water immediately before lying down."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A combination of tryptophan-rich protein and carbohydrates facilitates the transport of tryptophan across the blood-brain barrier, where it is converted to serotonin and then melatonin."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological cause of 'Runner’s Gut' (exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome) during high-intensity exercise in the heat?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive fiber intake the week before the race.",
                "Splanchnic hypoperfusion (reduced blood flow to the gut) leading to intestinal ischemia.",
                "Over-activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.",
                "Rapid gastric emptying caused by hypertonic solutions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During exercise, blood is shunted away from the GI tract to the working muscles and skin. This 'splanchnic hypoperfusion' causes intestinal ischemia, which damages the gut lining and increases permeability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In elite athlete populations, at what Ferritin level should a practitioner consider 'Stage 1 Iron Deficiency' (non-anemic), even if Hemoglobin levels appear normal?",
            "options": [
                "<10 ng/mL",
                "<35 ng/mL",
                "<100 ng/mL",
                "<12 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While clinical 'normal' ranges for the general population may go lower, athletic guidelines (such as those from the AIS) suggest Ferritin <35 ng/mL indicates depleted iron stores that can impair performance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A female cross-country runner presents with a history of two stress fractures in 12 months and irregular menses. Her blood work shows low T3 and low Ferritin. What is the most likely underlying cause?",

                "Primary Hyperparathyroidism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of bone injuries, menstrual dysfunction (amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea), and metabolic markers like low T3 are classic indicators of RED-S caused by chronic low energy availability."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which nutritional adjustment is most critical for an athlete traveling from sea level to a high-altitude training camp to prevent 'altitude impairment'?",
            "options": [
                "Reducing sodium intake to prevent edema.",
                "Increasing iron-rich foods and potentially supplementing iron (if Ferritin is <50-100 ng/mL).",
                "Increasing fat intake to 50% of total calories.",
                "Restricting fluid intake to maintain electrolyte concentration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Altitude triggers erythropoiesis (red blood cell production), which requires significant iron stores. Athletes with low pre-altitude ferritin often fail to adapt and experience greater performance declines."
