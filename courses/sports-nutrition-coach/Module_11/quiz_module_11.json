            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "During high-intensity interval training (HIIT), what occurs to the rate of phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis as muscle pH drops due to glycolytic byproduct accumulation?",
            "options": [
                "PCr resynthesis accelerates to compensate for ATP loss",
                "PCr resynthesis is significantly inhibited by acidosis",
                "PCr resynthesis remains constant regardless of pH",
                "PCr resynthesis switches to anaerobic pathways"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PCr resynthesis is an oxygen-dependent process. A drop in muscle pH (acidosis) inhibits the creatine kinase reaction and slows down the rate at which PCr stores can be replenished during recovery intervals."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In a nutritional periodization model, how should carbohydrate intake typically be adjusted when transitioning from a high-volume hypertrophy phase to a low-volume, maximum strength phase?",
            "options": [
                "Increase carbohydrates to support higher intensity",
                "Maintain identical macros to ensure recovery",
                "Decrease total carbohydrate intake to match lower training volume",
                "Eliminate carbohydrates to maximize growth hormone secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Since the strength phase typically involves lower total volume (fewer sets/reps) than a hypertrophy phase, the total glycogen demand is lower. Carbohydrates should be scaled down to prevent unwanted fat gain while maintaining enough for CNS intensity."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the clinical consensus on RED-S, what is the specific Energy Availability (EA) threshold below which significant impairments to bone health and metabolic rate are observed in women?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "30 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "20 kcal/kg FFM/day",
                "15 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that Energy Availability (EA) below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the threshold where the body begins downregulating reproductive and metabolic functions."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which micronutrient synergy is most critical for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine during collagen synthesis for connective tissue repair?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D and Calcium",
                "Magnesium and Zinc",
                "Vitamin C and Copper",
                "Vitamin K2 and Phosphorus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a required cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase, while Copper is essential for lysyl oxidase, which facilitates the cross-linking of collagen fibers to provide structural integrity."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "When an athlete moves from sea level to high altitude (>2,500m), why is there an increased physiological reliance on carbohydrate oxidation over fat oxidation?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrate yields more ATP per unit of oxygen consumed",
                "Fat stores are inaccessible at high altitudes",
                "Insulin sensitivity decreases at altitude",
                "Altitude increases the rate of lipolysis beyond capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Carbohydrates are a more 'oxygen-efficient' fuel source, producing more ATP per molecule of oxygen compared to fatty acids. In hypoxia (low oxygen), the body shifts toward glucose to maximize energy yield."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A 'Runner’s Gut' is often caused by splanchnic hypoperfusion. What percentage of blood flow can be diverted away from the GI tract toward working muscles during maximal exertion?",
            "options": [
                "Up to 20%",
                "Up to 50%",
                "Up to 80%",
                "Up to 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During intense exercise, the body can divert up to 80% of blood flow away from the gut to the skeletal muscles and skin, leading to ischemia and the common GI distress known as Runner's Gut."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which biomarker is considered the 'gold standard' for identifying Stage 1 Iron Deficiency in athletes, even when Hemoglobin levels appear normal?",
            "options": [
                "Serum Iron",
                "Serum Ferritin",
                "Transferrin Saturation",
                "Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serum Ferritin reflects the body's stored iron. In athletes, ferritin levels below 35 ng/mL are often indicative of depleted stores (Stage 1), which can impair performance before anemia (low hemoglobin) even develops."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In the context of Circadian Nutrition, how does late-night 'blue light' exposure specifically impact muscle protein synthesis (MPS)?",
            "options": [
                "It directly inhibits the mTOR pathway",
                "It suppresses melatonin, which disrupts the growth hormone pulse during deep sleep",
                "It increases insulin resistance the following morning",
                "It has no impact on MPS, only on cognitive function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light suppresses melatonin, leading to poor sleep quality. Since the largest pulse of Growth Hormone (GH) occurs during the first cycle of deep sleep, disrupted sleep directly impairs the hormonal environment necessary for MPS."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "An athlete training in extreme heat (35°C/95°F) for 10 days undergoes heat acclimatization. Which of the following is a primary sweat-related adaptation?",
            "options": [
                "Sweating starts later to conserve water",
                "Sweat becomes more concentrated with sodium",
                "Sweating starts earlier and becomes more dilute (lower sodium)",
                "The rate of sweating decreases to prevent dehydration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Heat acclimatization results in an earlier onset of sweating and a more dilute sweat (increased sodium reabsorption), which helps cool the body faster while preserving essential electrolytes."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "When interpreting a Free Testosterone to Cortisol (fT/C) ratio, a decrease of more than what percentage is typically indicative of an overreaching or 'catabolic' state?",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "30%",
                "75%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A drop of 30% or more in the fT/C ratio is a clinically significant marker of an altered anabolic-catabolic balance, suggesting the athlete is failing to recover from the training load."
