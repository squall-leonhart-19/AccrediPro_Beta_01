            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "According to the guidelines for the pre-exercise window, what is the recommended carbohydrate intake range for an athlete eating 1–4 hours before a high-intensity session?",
            "options": [
                "0.5–1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.0–4.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "5.0–7.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "Carbohydrates should be avoided to maximize fat oxidation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard evidence-based guidelines suggest 1–4g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight in the 1–4 hour window before exercise to ensure adequate glycogen availability and blood glucose maintenance."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "To achieve an intake of 90g of carbohydrate per hour during an ultra-endurance event, which strategy is physiologically necessary to prevent gastrointestinal distress?",
            "options": [
                "Using glucose as the sole carbohydrate source",
                "Consuming only high-fiber complex carbohydrates",
                "Utilizing multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., 2:1 glucose to fructose ratio)",
                "Restricting fluid intake to increase nutrient concentration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SGLT1 transporter for glucose saturates at approximately 60g/hr. To reach 90g/hr, fructose must be added to utilize the GLUT5 transporter, increasing total exogenous carbohydrate oxidation."
        },

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Based on the 2013 meta-analysis by Aragon and Schoenfeld, what is the primary determinant of muscle hypertrophy regarding protein timing?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming protein within exactly 30 minutes post-workout",
                "Total daily protein intake rather than precise timing around the 'anabolic window'",
                "Consuming protein only in the fasted state",
                "Avoiding protein for 2 hours post-exercise to allow growth hormone to peak"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis concluded that total daily protein intake is the strongest predictor of hypertrophy, debunking the strict necessity of the '30-minute anabolic window,' provided a high-protein meal is consumed within a few hours of training."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "For a marathon runner implementing a 36–48 hour carbohydrate loading protocol, what is the target carbohydrate intake to maximize muscle glycogen stores?",
            "options": [
                "3–5 g/kg/day",
                "5–7 g/kg/day",

                "15–20 g/kg/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern carbohydrate loading protocols (such as those studied by Burke et al.) suggest 10–12g/kg of body weight per 24 hours for 36–48 hours to fully saturate glycogen stores."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "In a multi-day tournament scenario with less than 4 hours between matches, what is the recommended rate of carbohydrate ingestion to ensure rapid glycogen resynthesis?",

                "0.5 g/kg/hr",
                "1.2 g/kg/hr",
                "2.5 g/kg/hr",
                "Carbohydrates should be limited to avoid 'heavy legs'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When the recovery window is <4 hours, an aggressive intake of 1.2g/kg/hr of high-glycemic carbohydrates is recommended to maximize the rate of glycogen resynthesis."

            "id": "q7_6",

            "options": [
                "Increased muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates throughout the night",
                "Significant fat gain due to nighttime insulin spikes",
                "Interruption of deep sleep cycles",
                "Decreased metabolic rate the following morning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found that 40g of casein protein ingested before sleep is effectively digested and absorbed, stimulating muscle protein synthesis and improving whole-body protein balance during overnight recovery."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "What is the primary rationale behind the 'Train Low' (fasted training) strategy in endurance athletes?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize absolute power output during the session",
                "To enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulate fat oxidation enzymes",
                "To reduce the total caloric intake of the athlete for weight loss",
                "To improve the taste of the post-workout meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Training with low glycogen availability (Train Low) acts as a signaling stimulus to increase the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (like PGC-1alpha) and increase the capacity for fat oxidation."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "During a tournament (Lesson 8 Case Study), if an athlete has a 6-hour gap between events, what should the glycemic index (GI) profile of the 'mid-day' meal be?",
            "options": [
                "Very high GI to spike insulin immediately",
                "Moderate to Low GI to provide sustained glucose release and avoid a subsequent crash",
                "The meal should be liquid only, regardless of GI",
                "The athlete should remain fasted to stay 'sharp'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "With a longer 6-hour gap, a moderate-to-low GI meal is preferred to provide sustained energy and prevent reactive hypoglycemia before the next event, whereas high GI is reserved for the immediate post-match recovery."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which physiological marker is most affected by 'sleep-low' protocols (training late, sleeping without carb intake, training fasted the next morning)?",
            "options": [
                "Increased resting heart rate",
                "Enhanced activation of p38 MAPK and AMPK signaling pathways",

                "Increased VO2 Max within a single 24-hour period"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep-low protocols extend the duration of low-glycogen signaling, which enhances the activation of metabolic sensors like AMPK and p38 MAPK, leading to greater training adaptations."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "An 80kg athlete is performing a glycogen-depleting HIIT session. To optimize recovery according to the '3-R' principle, how much protein should be included in their immediate post-exercise meal?",
            "options": [
                "10g (0.125g/kg)",
                "20-25g (0.25-0.3g/kg)",

                "80g (1.0g/kg)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To maximize the anabolic response post-exercise, current research suggests a dose of 0.4–0.5g/kg of body weight, which for an 80kg athlete equals 32–40g of high-quality protein."
