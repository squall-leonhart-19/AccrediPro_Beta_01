            "question": "According to the Neurobiology of Performance, while glucose is the brain's primary fuel, what percentage of the brain's energy requirements can be met by ketones during periods of prolonged carbohydrate restriction or intense endurance exercise?",
            "options": [
                "Up to 20%",
                "Up to 40%",
                "Up to 70%",
                "Up to 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that during metabolic adaptation or prolonged exercise, ketones (specifically beta-hydroxybutyrate) can cross the blood-brain barrier and supply up to 70% of the brain's energy needs, providing a more efficient fuel source than glucose in specific contexts."

            "question": "A tennis player is struggling with 'mental fatigue' and loss of focus during long matches. Which amino acid precursor should be prioritized to support the synthesis of dopamine and norepinephrine to maintain cognitive drive?",
            "options": [
                "L-Tryptophan",
                "L-Tyrosine",
                "L-Theanine",
                "L-Glycine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Tyrosine is the direct precursor to catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine). Supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive performance under environmental stress or high-demand tasks by preventing the depletion of these neurotransmitters."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "At what specific threshold of body mass loss due to dehydration do meta-analyses consistently show a significant decline in executive function, attention, and motor coordination?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% loss",
                "1.0% loss",
                "2.0% loss",
                "5.0% loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 2% reduction in body mass through fluid loss is the established threshold where cognitive precision, decision-making speed, and short-term memory significantly degrade, regardless of the athlete's perceived thirst."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "When utilizing caffeine for a competitive edge, what is the primary mechanism by which it reduces the perception of effort (RPE)?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the release of GABA in the motor cortex",
                "Antagonizing adenosine receptors in the brain",
                "Directly stimulating the release of insulin",
                "Inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Caffeine is structurally similar to adenosine. By binding to and antagonizing adenosine receptors, it prevents the inhibitory effects of adenosine on the central nervous system, leading to increased alertness and a lower rating of perceived exertion (RPE)."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The 'Central Fatigue Hypothesis' suggests that during prolonged exercise, an increase in the ratio of ______ to ______ allows more Tryptophan to cross the blood-brain barrier, increasing serotonin and inducing lethargy.",
            "options": [
                "Free Fatty Acids to Glucose",
                "Dopamine to Acetylcholine",
                "Free Tryptophan to Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAA)",
                "Glutamate to GABA"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As BCAAs are oxidized for fuel during exercise, the ratio of Free Tryptophan to BCAAs increases. Since they compete for the same transport carrier into the brain, more Tryptophan enters, leading to increased serotonin and the onset of central fatigue."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, often combined with Bifidobacterium longum, has been shown in clinical trials to significantly lower serum cortisol and improve the stress response via the Vagus nerve signaling pathway."

            "question": "A client presents with 'brain fog' and slow nerve conduction. They have been on a strict vegan diet for 18 months without supplementation. Which micronutrient deficiency is the most likely culprit affecting their myelin sheath integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin B6",
                "Vitamin B12",

                "Magnesium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) is essential for the maintenance of the myelin sheath that surrounds nerves. Deficiency, common in unsupplemented vegan diets, leads to neurological symptoms, cognitive decline, and paresthesia."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the context of pre-competition anxiety, Magnesium acts as a 'gatekeeper' for which receptor, preventing the over-excitation of the central nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "The NMDA receptor",
                "The Insulin receptor",

                "The Mu-opioid receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Magnesium sits in the pore of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, blocking calcium influx. Low magnesium levels allow the receptor to become over-activated by glutamate, leading to hyperexcitability and increased anxiety."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Recent studies on 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor' (BDNF) suggest that which nutritional intervention may synergize with aerobic exercise to enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive recovery?",
            "options": [
                "High Sodium intake",
                "Omega-3 fatty acids (specifically DHA)",
                "Isolated Leucine supplementation",
                "Iron loading"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) is a structural component of the brain that supports BDNF signaling. The combination of DHA and exercise has a synergistic effect on synaptic plasticity and cognitive resilience."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended dosage of Creatine Monohydrate for neuroprotective benefits and cognitive processing support, particularly in sleep-deprived athletes?",
            "options": [
                "1-2g per day",
                "5-10g per day",
                "20-30g per day",
                "Only on training days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 3-5g is standard for muscle saturation, evidence suggests higher doses (5-10g) may be necessary to increase brain creatine stores, which helps maintain ATP levels in neurons during high-stress or sleep-deprived states."
