            "question": "In the 'Sleep-Low' model of intra-day macronutrient periodization, what is the primary physiological objective of restricting carbohydrates overnight following an evening high-intensity session?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize muscle protein synthesis through growth hormone spikes",
                "To prolong the activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK for mitochondrial biogenesis",
                "To reduce total caloric intake for rapid weight class qualification",
                "To increase the rate of gastric emptying for the morning session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sleep-Low' strategy aims to extend the duration that the body remains in a low-glycogen state, which enhances the signaling pathways (like AMPK) responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation adaptations."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Crossover Point concept, at what approximate intensity of VO2 max does the body typically transition from fat-dominant to carbohydrate-dominant fuel utilization?",
            "options": [
                "35-45% VO2 max",
                "50-55% VO2 max",

                "80-85% VO2 max"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The crossover point generally occurs at approximately 65% of VO2 max, though this is highly trainable and can shift to the right in elite endurance athletes."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "During the 'Insulin-Independent' phase of glycogen resynthesis (the first 30-60 minutes post-exercise), what is the primary mechanism driving glucose uptake?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immediately post-exercise, GLUT4 transporters remain at the cell membrane due to the mechanical stress of contraction, allowing for rapid glucose uptake even without high insulin levels."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "To optimize iron bioavailability in athletes, why is it recommended to avoid iron supplementation within 3-6 hours post-exercise?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron entry into the circulation, peaks 3-6 hours after intense exercise, significantly inhibiting the absorption of oral iron."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "An athlete is preparing for a marathon in 35°C (95°F) heat. Using a glycerol-induced hyper-hydration protocol, what is the standard evidence-based dosage?",

                "Glycerol is only effective when taken with 20g of creatine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A dose of 1.0-1.5g of glycerol per kg of body weight, combined with a large fluid bolus (25-35mL/kg), is the standard protocol to increase total body water and plasma volume before heat stress."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "When monitoring Biometrics, a decrease in Heart Rate Variability (specifically RMSSD) combined with an increased resting heart rate most likely indicates:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lower RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) and higher resting HR are markers of autonomic nervous system stress, indicating the athlete is not fully recovering."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) are oxidized for fuel, the ratio of free Tryptophan to other amino acids increases, allowing more Tryptophan to cross the blood-brain barrier and convert to Serotonin, which induces lethargy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current clinical guidelines recommend 1.2g of carbohydrate per kg of body weight per hour to maximize the rate of glycogen resynthesis when the turnaround time is short."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D increases calcium absorption, but Vitamin K2 is required to activate osteocalcin and Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), which direct calcium into the bones and away from the soft tissues/arteries."
