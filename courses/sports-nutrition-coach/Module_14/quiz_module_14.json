            "question": "In the context of Intra-Day Macronutrient Periodization, what is the primary physiological rationale for the 'Sleep Low, Train Low' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To maximize muscle protein synthesis through mTOR activation",
                "To enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid oxidation via AMPK and PGC-1α signaling",

                "To increase the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis for the following day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sleep Low, Train Low' strategy aims to prolong the duration of low glycogen availability, which amplifies the activation of signaling pathways like AMPK and PGC-1α, leading to superior mitochondrial adaptations."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "During the 'Insulin-Independent' phase of glycogen resynthesis (0-60 minutes post-exercise), what is the primary driver of glucose uptake into the muscle cell?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immediately post-exercise, GLUT4 transporters remain at the cell membrane due to the mechanical stress of contraction, allowing for rapid glucose uptake even in the absence of insulin."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 increases calcium absorption, while Vitamin K2 (specifically MK-7) activates osteocalcin and matrix GLA protein to ensure calcium is deposited in the bones and not the arterial walls."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A 70kg triathlete is using a glycerol-induced hyper-hydration protocol for a race in extreme heat. According to clinical guidelines, what is the recommended dosage of glycerol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standard hyper-hydration protocols recommend 1.0 to 1.5 grams of glycerol per kilogram of body weight, consumed with 25-35 mL/kg of fluid, to expand plasma volume."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD reflects parasympathetic (vagal) activity. A decline in RMSSD suggests the body is under stress and the sympathetic nervous system is dominating, indicating a need for recovery."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "How does the 'Central Fatigue Hypothesis' explain the relationship between BCAAs and Tryptophan during prolonged endurance exercise?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BCAAs and Tryptophan share the same Large Neutral Amino Acid (LAT1) transporter. By maintaining BCAA levels, athletes can limit the amount of Tryptophan entering the brain, thereby reducing serotonin-induced central fatigue."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Which of the following describes the 'Inverted-U' relationship between sodium intake and osmoregulation in extreme environments?",
            "options": [
                "Both very low and very high sodium intakes can impair performance and fluid balance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Effective osmoregulation requires a 'Goldilocks' zone of sodium; too little leads to hyponatremia and fluid loss, while too much can cause hypernatremia and cellular dehydration."
