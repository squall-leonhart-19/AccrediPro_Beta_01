            "id": "q13_6",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is unique because it is released from contracting muscles (as a myokine) to assist with fuel mobilization, even though it is also involved in the systemic inflammatory response."
