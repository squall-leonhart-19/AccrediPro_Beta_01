            "question": "In the context of Bioenergetics, how long does it typically take for the ATP-PCr system to achieve approximately 95% resynthesis of intramuscular phosphocreatine stores following a 10-second maximal bout of exercise?",
            "options": [
                "30 to 45 seconds",
                "90 seconds to 2 minutes",
                "3 to 5 minutes",
                "10 to 12 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis follows a biphasic kinetic curve, with the rapid phase occurring in the first 30-60 seconds, but full restoration (approx. 95-98%) typically requires 3 to 5 minutes of passive recovery."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Which rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway is most significantly inhibited by high intracellular concentrations of ATP and Citrate, effectively slowing glycolytic flux when energy demands are low?",
            "options": [
                "Hexokinase",
                "Phosphofructokinase (PFK)",
                "Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)",
                "Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is the primary 'gatekeeper' of glycolysis. It is allosterically inhibited by ATP and citrate (signaling high energy availability) and stimulated by AMP and ADP (signaling energy depletion)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Train Low, Compete High' paradigm, what is the primary physiological mechanism targeted by performing low-intensity sessions with low glycogen availability?",
            "options": [
                "Maximizing Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) via the mTOR pathway",
                "Upregulation of PGC-1α and mitochondrial biogenesis signaling",
                "Increasing the rate of anaerobic glycolysis and lactate clearance",
                "Reducing cortisol response to high-intensity intervals"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Training in a glycogen-depleted state increases the activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK, which in turn upregulates PGC-1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative efficiency."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "An athlete presents with a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.72 during a fasted, resting metabolic test. What does this value indicate regarding their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete is primarily oxidizing carbohydrates at rest.",
                "The athlete is in a state of metabolic acidosis.",
                "The athlete exhibits high metabolic flexibility, primarily oxidizing fatty acids at rest.",
                "The athlete is experiencing significant protein catabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70-0.75 at rest indicates a high reliance on lipid oxidation (fats). Metabolic flexibility is characterized by the ability to shift to fat oxidation during rest/low intensity and switch efficiently to carbohydrate oxidation during high intensity."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In the 'Sleep-Low' micro-periodization model, which sequence of training and nutrition is most accurate for enhancing metabolic adaptations?",
            "options": [
                "Morning HI session -> High CHO day -> Evening Low-intensity session",
                "Evening HI session -> CHO restriction overnight -> Morning Low-intensity fasted session",
                "Fasted Morning HI session -> High CHO post-workout -> Evening HI session",
                "Evening Low-intensity session -> High CHO dinner -> Morning HI session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sleep-Low' strategy involves a high-intensity (HI) session in the evening to deplete glycogen, restricting carbohydrates overnight to maintain signaling, and performing a fasted session the next morning to maximize mitochondrial adaptation."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Based on IOC consensus data, what is the 'danger zone' threshold for Energy Availability (EA) where physiological impairments (RED-S) such as menstrual dysfunction and bone mineral density loss become significantly more likely?",
            "options": [
                "Below 45 kcal/kg FFM/day",

                "Below 20 kcal/kg FFM/day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 45 kcal/kg FFM/day is considered optimal for most athletes, research consistently shows that physiological disruptions (RED-S) manifest most clearly when EA drops below 30 kcal/kg Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day."

                "Aggressive caloric deficit to reach a new 'racing weight'",
                "Ad libitum intake with a focus on micronutrient density and psychological recovery",
                "Strict ketogenic dieting to maximize fat oxidation for the next season"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Transition Phase (off-season) focuses on physical and psychological recovery. Nutritional rigidity should be reduced, focusing on repair and health rather than performance-driven fueling protocols."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EA = (Energy Intake - Exercise Energy Expenditure) / FFM. Calculation: (2200 - 1100) / 55 = 20 kcal/kg FFM/day. This athlete is in a state of low energy availability."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "IL-6 is a myokine that acts as a primary signaling molecule for the acute inflammatory response to muscle damage, peaking shortly after intense exercise to initiate the repair process."

                "The intensity at which the contribution of lipids to energy expenditure equals that of carbohydrates.",
                "The point where muscle glycogen is completely exhausted and the liver takes over.",
                "The moment when protein oxidation exceeds 15% of total energy expenditure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The cross-over point describes the exercise intensity (usually expressed as % VO2 max) where the body shifts from using predominantly fats to predominantly carbohydrates for fuel."
