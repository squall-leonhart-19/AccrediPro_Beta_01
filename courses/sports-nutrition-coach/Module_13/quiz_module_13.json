            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During high-stress or anxiety-inducing events, the sympathetic nervous system diverts blood away from the digestive system (splanchnic vasoconstriction), which can lead to GI distress if the athlete consumes high-fiber or high-fat foods too close to competition."
