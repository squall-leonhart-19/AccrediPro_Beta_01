            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body diverts the precursor pregnenolone toward cortisol production to ensure survival, often at the expense of progesterone and testosterone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that even one night of restricted sleep can reduce insulin sensitivity by up to 40%, significantly impacting glucose regulation the following day."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are 'estrogen mimics' that bind to receptors, sending false signals to the body and contributing to conditions like estrogen dominance."

            "question": "Client Case: Sarah (42) presents with brain fog, thinning outer eyebrows, and cold intolerance. Her TSH is 'normal' (3.5 uIU/mL), but her Free T3 is low. What is the most likely functional interpretation?",
            "options": [
                "She has perfect thyroid health because TSH is in range",
                "She is likely experiencing poor T4 to T3 conversion",

                "She has an overactive thyroid (Hyperthyroidism)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms and low Free T3 despite a 'normal' TSH suggest a conversion issue, often caused by stress, nutrient deficiencies, or gut inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protein and fiber slow the absorption of glucose, preventing insulin spikes and allowing glucagon to access stored body fat for fuel."
