            "question": "According to the World Health Organization and the foundations of Lifestyle Medicine, what percentage of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes is estimated to be preventable through lifestyle modifications alone?",
            "options": ["Approximately 40%", "Approximately 60%", "Approximately 80%", "Approximately 95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that up to 80% of chronic conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes are preventable by addressing the core pillars of lifestyle medicine: nutrition, movement, sleep, and stress management."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Therapeutic Nutrition: Food as Information,' which mechanism explains how bioactive compounds in broccoli (like sulforaphane) influence health?",
            "options": ["By providing empty calories for ATP production", "By acting as ligands that trigger the Nrf2 pathway to enhance antioxidant expression", "By inhibiting the absorption of all dietary fats in the small intestine", "By neutralizing stomach acid to prevent GERD symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrigenomics teaches that food is information; sulforaphane acts as a molecular signal that activates the Nrf2 pathway, which regulates over 200 genes related to detoxification and antioxidant defense."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client spends 8 hours a day sitting but exercises for 60 minutes at the gym. According to the research on NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis), why might this client still struggle with metabolic health?",
            "options": ["The 'Active Couch Potato' phenomenon, where prolonged sedentary time negates some benefits of a single exercise bout", "They are not lifting heavy enough weights to trigger hypertrophy", "Exercise must be performed in the fasted state to be effective", "The gym environment causes a cortisol spike that prevents fat loss"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Active Couch Potato' effect describes individuals who meet exercise guidelines but remain sedentary for the rest of the day, which can lead to suppressed lipoprotein lipase activity and impaired glucose clearance."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which physiological process is primarily responsible for the 'sleep pressure' that builds up during waking hours and is cleared during deep sleep?",
            "options": ["The accumulation of melatonin in the pineal gland", "The depletion of glycogen stores in the liver", "The accumulation of adenosine in the basal forebrain", "The rise of core body temperature throughout the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adenosine is a byproduct of energy (ATP) consumption. As it builds up, it increases sleep pressure. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors, temporarily masking this pressure."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), chronic stress leads to 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Resistance.' What is the clinical result of this phenomenon?",
            "options": ["The immune system becomes hyper-sensitive to cortisol", "Immune cells lose their ability to respond to anti-inflammatory signals, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation", "The adrenal glands stop producing cortisol entirely", "Rapid weight loss due to increased metabolic rate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When cortisol is chronically elevated, immune cells downregulate their receptors (resistance), meaning the body can no longer effectively 'turn off' the inflammatory response, leading to systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "The 2010 meta-analysis by Julianne Holt-Lunstad (n=308,849) found that social isolation and loneliness carry a mortality risk factor equivalent to:",
            "options": ["Smoking 15 cigarettes per day", "Consuming 5 sugary beverages per day", "Being 10 pounds overweight", "Walking less than 3,000 steps per day"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The study found that the influence of social relationships on the risk of death is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality such as smoking and alcohol consumption and exceeds the influence of physical inactivity and obesity."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When applying 'Risk Mitigation' strategies for a client who consumes alcohol, which of the following is an evidence-based recommendation to protect sleep architecture?",
            "options": ["Consuming alcohol immediately before bed to induce drowsiness", "Drinking coffee after alcohol to neutralize the sedative effects", "Maintaining a 'buffer zone' of at least 3-4 hours between the last drink and sleep", "Switching from red wine to clear spirits to increase REM sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alcohol is a sedative that fragments sleep and suppresses REM cycles. A 3-4 hour buffer allows the liver to metabolize the majority of the ethanol, reducing its disruptive impact on sleep architecture."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to the Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAP), which three elements must converge at the same moment for a lifestyle behavior to occur?",
            "options": ["Money, Access, and Purpose", "Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt", "Mindset, Action, and Persistence", "Muscle, Aerobics, and Protein"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BJ Fogg’s model states that Behavior (B) happens when Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P) come together. If any are missing, the behavior will not occur."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client with pre-diabetes wants to use movement to manage post-prandial (after-meal) glucose. Based on clinical guidelines, what is the most effective intervention?",
            "options": ["A high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session before breakfast", "A 10-20 minute light walk starting within 30 minutes after finishing a meal", "Waiting 2 hours after a meal to perform heavy resistance training", "Resting in a reclined position to aid digestion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light activity, such as walking shortly after a meal, triggers GLUT4 translocation in the muscles, allowing them to clear glucose from the bloodstream without requiring high levels of insulin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Which environmental health factor is most closely linked to the disruption of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) and subsequent metabolic dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Exposure to BPA in plastic water bottles", "Lack of morning sunlight and excessive evening blue light exposure", "Noise pollution in urban environments", "Drinking unfiltered tap water"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SCN is the master circadian clock. It relies on high-intensity blue light (sunlight) in the morning to set the rhythm and the absence of blue light in the evening to trigger melatonin production. Disruption leads to 'circadian mismatch,' a major driver of metabolic syndrome."
