            "question": "According to the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and foundational WHOLE method data, what percentage of chronic disease is estimated to be preventable through the modification of lifestyle factors?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 40%",
                "Approximately 60%",

                "Approximately 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that roughly 80% of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers, are linked to lifestyle choices such as diet, physical activity, and tobacco use."

            "question": "In the context of 'Food as Information,' how does the field of Nutrigenomics describe the relationship between diet and biology?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrients are simply fuel sources used for caloric energy expenditure.",
                "Nutrients act as signaling molecules that can influence gene expression and cellular function.",
                "Dietary patterns are secondary to genetic predispositions in all chronic conditions.",
                "Food only affects the physical structure of the gut microbiome without systemic impact."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nutrigenomics studies how specific nutrients and bioactive compounds in food act as signals that can turn genes on or off, essentially providing 'instructions' to our DNA."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client spends 8 hours a day at a desk but performs a 45-minute HIIT workout 3 times a week. Despite the exercise, they are struggling with metabolic health. Which concept explains this discrepancy?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) accounts for the majority of non-resting energy expenditure. High sedentary time (the 'active couch potato' profile) can negate many metabolic benefits of structured exercise."

            "question": "The 'Glymphatic System' is most active during which stage of sleep, and what is its primary function?",
            "options": [
                "REM sleep; processing emotional memories and trauma.",
                "Stage 1 Light sleep; transitioning the body to a lower temperature.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system is a waste-clearance pathway in the central nervous system that becomes highly active during deep NREM sleep, 'washing' the brain of toxic byproducts."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), chronic stress leads to 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Resistance.' What is the clinical result of this state?",

                "Enhanced immune system surveillance and faster wound healing.",
                "The immune system stops responding to the anti-inflammatory signals of cortisol, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation.",

                "A total cessation of cytokine production in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When cortisol is chronically elevated, cells become less sensitive to it. Since cortisol is a primary anti-inflammatory signal, this resistance allows inflammation to run unchecked."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A landmark meta-analysis by Julianne Holt-Lunstad found that social isolation and loneliness carry a mortality risk equivalent to smoking how many cigarettes per day?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study (n=308,849) found that the influence of social relationships on the risk of death is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality, such as smoking 15 cigarettes a day."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phthalates and BPA are common endocrine disruptors found in plastics and the coatings of thermal receipts; avoiding these direct contact points is a primary mitigation strategy."

            "question": "How does alcohol consumption typically impact sleep architecture according to polysomnography studies?",
            "options": [
                "It increases REM sleep duration throughout the night.",
                "It improves sleep continuity and prevents middle-of-the-night awakenings.",
                "It acts as a sedative that increases Deep Sleep but suppresses REM sleep in the first half of the night, leading to a 'REM rebound' later.",
                "It has no measurable effect on sleep architecture if consumed 2 hours before bed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alcohol is a sedative that may help with sleep onset but severely fragments sleep and suppresses REM cycles, leading to poor sleep quality and daytime cognitive impairment."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Habit stacking relies on the 'After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]' formula, which uses existing neural pathways to anchor new behaviors."
