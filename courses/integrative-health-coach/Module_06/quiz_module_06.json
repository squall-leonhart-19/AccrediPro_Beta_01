            "question": "A client is taking Warfarin (a blood thinner) and wishes to start a botanical protocol. Which of the following herbs poses the highest risk of a dangerous drug-herb interaction due to its effect on the Cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) enzyme system?",
            "options": [
                "St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum)",
                "Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)",

                "Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme, which can significantly lower the plasma concentration of many medications, including anticoagulants like Warfarin, potentially leading to sub-therapeutic levels and increased clot risk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light exposure in the evening strongly suppresses melatonin secretion from the pineal gland, often by 50% or more, shifting the circadian rhythm and delaying sleep onset."
