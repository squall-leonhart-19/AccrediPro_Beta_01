            "question": "According to the concept of 'Allostatic Load' discussed in Lesson 1, what happens to the body's innate healing capacity during prolonged chronic stress?",
            "options": [
                "The body enters a state of 'hyper-repair' where healing accelerates to match the stress.",
                "The cumulative wear and tear leads to a 'weathering' effect that suppresses the parasympathetic nervous system's repair mechanisms.",
                "The body shifts resources exclusively to the prefrontal cortex, enhancing cognitive healing.",
                "Allostatic load has no impact on innate healing as long as the client maintains a high-protein diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load refers to the cumulative biological wear and tear resulting from chronic overactivation of the stress response, which prevents the body from returning to a state of homeostasis and inhibits innate healing protocols."

            "question": "A 2011 meta-analysis by Berkman et al. highlighted that individuals with low health literacy experience which of the following outcomes?",
            "options": [
                "A 15% increase in medication adherence due to simpler routines.",
                "Higher rates of hospitalization and a significantly greater use of emergency services.",
                "Lower healthcare costs because they seek fewer diagnostic tests.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The research found that low health literacy is consistently linked to poorer health outcomes, including increased hospitalization and emergency room visits, underscoring the importance of health literacy as a foundation for autonomy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Insular Cortex is the primary hub for interoceptive awareness, processing signals from the heart, lungs, and gut to provide the 'feeling' of the body's internal state."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "When applying Narrative Medicine (Lesson 6), what is the primary goal of moving a client from a 'Restitution Narrative' to a 'Quest Narrative'?",
            "options": [
                "To convince the client that they will be 100% cured within a month.",
                "To help the client find meaning, wisdom, and personal growth through the experience of illness.",
                "To focus exclusively on the clinical symptoms and ignore the personal story.",
                "To encourage the client to stop all medical treatments in favor of storytelling."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Quest Narrative' frames the illness as a journey that can lead to personal transformation and meaning, which is more empowering than a 'Restitution Narrative' that focuses solely on returning to the exact state before the illness."
