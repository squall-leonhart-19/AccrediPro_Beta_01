            "question": "According to the physiology of innate healing, which branch of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) must be dominant to facilitate cellular repair, protein synthesis, and immune system modulation?",
            "options": [
                "The Sympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Parasympathetic Nervous System",
                "The Enteric Nervous System",
                "The Somatic Nervous System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS), often called the 'rest and digest' or 'heal and regenerate' system, is the physiological state required for the body's innate self-repair mechanisms to function optimally."

            "question": "Data from the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) reveals a significant challenge in healthcare; what percentage of the adult population is estimated to have 'Proficient' health literacy skills?",
            "options": [
                "12%",
                "28%",
                "45%",
                "62%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Only 12% of adults have proficient health literacy, meaning the vast majority of clients struggle to understand complex health information, which is a primary barrier to self-healing and autonomy."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client states, 'It doesn't matter what I eat; my health is entirely up to my genetics and what my doctor prescribes.' This client is demonstrating a strong:",

                "Interoceptive Awareness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An External Locus of Control is the belief that health outcomes are determined by outside forces (doctors, fate, genetics) rather than one's own actions."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity, the phenomenon of 'Long-Term Potentiation' (LTP) is best described by which principle?",

                "The brain's inability to change after age 25"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory, or Long-Term Potentiation, suggests that repeated stimulation of specific neural pathways strengthens the synaptic connection, making that habit or thought pattern more 'wired' in the brain."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Which specific region of the brain acts as the primary 'hub' for interoception, integrating internal bodily sensations with emotional and cognitive processing?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Insula is the primary brain region responsible for interoception—the sensing of the internal state of the body—and is crucial for the mind-body connection."
        },

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Dr. Rita Charon's framework of Narrative Medicine emphasizes 'Narrative Competence.' For a Health Coach, this means the ability to:",

                "Correct a client's inaccurate health history",
                "Acknowledge, absorb, interpret, and be moved by the client's story",
                "Direct the client to follow a standardized protocol",
                "Minimize the client's emotional expression to focus on data"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narrative competence is the clinical skill to recognize and value the patient's story as a vital component of the healing process, moving beyond simple data collection."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "In the transition from Coach-Led to Self-Managed care, what is the primary purpose of the 'Scaffolding' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To provide a permanent structure the client must always follow",
                "To increase the frequency of coaching sessions over time",
                "To provide temporary support that is gradually removed as the client gains competence",
                "To ensure the coach remains the primary decision-maker"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing the necessary support for a client to learn a new skill and then systematically withdrawing that support as the client develops the autonomy to manage it themselves."

            "id": "q5_8",

                "Body Mass Index (BMI)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a key indicator of a resilient Autonomic Nervous System, reflecting the body's ability to switch efficiently between sympathetic and parasympathetic states."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive exposure helps clients build a 'neutral' relationship with bodily sensations, reducing the fear-response associated with those sensations through neuroplastic changes in the insula and prefrontal cortex."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Teach-Back method is a health literacy tool where the client explains the plan back to the coach; it is a test of how well the coach communicated, not a test of the client's intelligence."
