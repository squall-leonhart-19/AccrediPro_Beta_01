            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While the average Western diet features a ratio of 15:1 to 20:1, clinical guidelines for anti-inflammatory nutrition suggest a target ratio between 1:1 and 4:1 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis."
