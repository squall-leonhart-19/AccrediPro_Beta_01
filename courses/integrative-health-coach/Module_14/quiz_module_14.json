            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "According to the 'Triad of Health' model, what percentage of the body's total immune cells are housed within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 30-40%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 70-80%",
                "Over 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GALT represents the largest mass of lymphoid tissue in the body, containing roughly 70-80% of the immune system, making the gut the primary interface between the environment and systemic immunity."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which specific molecule, released from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is the primary driver of 'metabolic endotoxemia' when it crosses a permeable gut barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",
                "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)",
                "Zonulin",
                "Butyrate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are potent endotoxins. When they translocate into the bloodstream due to increased intestinal permeability, they trigger systemic inflammation by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3's discussion on neuro-inflammation, which cells are described as the 'resident macrophages' of the brain that can become chronically 'primed' by systemic inflammatory signals?",
            "options": [
                "Astrocytes",
                "Oligodendrocytes",
                "Microglia",
                "Pyramidal neurons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Microglia are the brain's primary immune cells. Chronic systemic inflammation can 'prime' these cells, causing them to overreact to minor triggers and release neurotoxic cytokines, leading to cognitive decline."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is often called the 'Second Brain.' Approximately how much of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut rather than the brain?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "25-30%",

                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in the brain, roughly 90-95% of it is synthesized by enterochromaffin cells in the gut, where it regulates motility and signals the brain via the vagus nerve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which protein serves as the primary physiological modulator of 'tight junctions' in the intestinal epithelium, and is often over-expressed in response to gluten and dysbiosis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels of zonulin increase intestinal permeability, allowing undigested food particles and toxins into the bloodstream."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) discussed in Lesson 6 revealed that patients with Fibromyalgia consistently exhibited significantly higher systemic levels of which inflammatory marker?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis highlighted IL-6 as a key cytokine elevated in Fibromyalgia patients, suggesting that the condition is driven by systemic, low-grade inflammation rather than just localized muscle pain."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is considered the 'gold standard' for maintaining mucosal integrity and providing the primary energy source for colonocytes?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is critical for gut health; it fuels the cells lining the colon, maintains the oxygen-free environment required for beneficial bacteria, and has potent anti-inflammatory effects."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the standard metric for assessing vagal tone. High HRV indicates a resilient parasympathetic nervous system capable of effectively modulating the stress response."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Client Case Study: 'Sarah,' 42, presents with brain fog, joint pain, and bloating. Her labs show elevated LPS antibodies. Which nutritional intervention is most targeted at restoring her mucosal barrier integrity?",

                "Low-Fat Vegan Diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Glutamine is the preferred fuel for enterocytes in the small intestine, and Zinc Carnosine has been clinically shown to repair the gastric lining and stabilize tight junctions, directly addressing Sarah's 'leaky gut' indicated by LPS antibodies."

                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve releases acetylcholine, which binds to nicotinic receptors on macrophages (especially in the spleen), signaling them to stop producing the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α."
