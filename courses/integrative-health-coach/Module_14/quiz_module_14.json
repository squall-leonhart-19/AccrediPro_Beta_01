            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the human body's total immune cells are located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT), making the gut the primary 'training ground' for the immune system?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in Lesson 1, the GALT houses 70-80% of the body's immune cells, highlighting the gut's central role in systemic immune regulation and the development of oral tolerance."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Which specific bacterial component is primarily responsible for triggering 'metabolic endotoxemia' when it translocates from the gut lumen into systemic circulation through a compromised epithelial barrier?",
            "options": [
                "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)",
                "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)",

                "Bifidobacterium metabolites"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are endotoxins found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. When they enter the bloodstream (endotoxemia), they trigger a systemic inflammatory response by binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In the context of neuro-inflammation, which cells act as the primary 'resident macrophages' of the brain and can be chronically activated by systemic cytokines, leading to cognitive 'brain fog' and synaptic pruning?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that roughly 95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, where it regulates motility, secretion, and signals the brain via the vagus nerve."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the protein that regulates the opening of tight junctions between enterocytes. Excessive zonulin release leads to increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut')."
