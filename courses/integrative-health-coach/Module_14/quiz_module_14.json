            "options": [
                "Competing in an existing market with lower prices than established coaches.",
                "Creating an uncontested market space by focusing on a highly specific, underserved psychographic.",
                "Marketing to the broadest possible audience to ensure a high volume of leads.",
                "Focusing exclusively on geographic local marketing to avoid digital competition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Blue Ocean' strategy involves creating a new market space or niche where there is little to no competition, typically by solving a specific problem for a specific population that is currently overlooked by generalists."

            "question": "In the context of Lesson 2, why is a 'Professional Liability Insurance' (PLI) policy with a 'Prior Acts' or 'Tail' coverage essential for an Integrative Health Coach?",

                "It covers the coach for medical procedures they are not licensed to perform.",
                "It provides health insurance for the coach's family and employees.",
                "It protects against claims arising from services provided before the current policy started or after it ends.",
                "It is a legal requirement for filing a business tax return in most states."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tail coverage or Prior Acts coverage ensures that a coach is protected from claims that may be filed years after a coaching relationship has ended, which is critical given the varying statutes of limitations for professional liability."

            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses High-Ticket Program Design. What is the primary reason that 'Value-Based Pricing' is superior to 'Hourly Billing' for both the coach and the client?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to work fewer hours for the same amount of money.",
                "It shifts the focus from 'time spent' to 'outcomes achieved,' increasing client commitment and success rates.",
                "It makes the coach's taxes easier to calculate at the end of the year.",
                "Clients are more likely to sign up for programs that have a higher price tag regardless of the content."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing aligns the coach's incentives with the client's results. By pricing based on the transformation (outcome), clients perceive higher value and demonstrate greater psychological 'skin in the game,' leading to better adherence."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "During a Sales Consultation (Lesson 4), a prospect expresses a 'Price Objection.' According to the sales mastery framework, what should be the coach's first step?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately offer a 20% discount to secure the sign-up.",
                "Defend the price by listing all the certifications the coach has earned.",
                "Empathize and ask clarifying questions to determine if the objection is about 'cost' or 'perceived value/certainty'.",
                "End the call politely, as price objections indicate the prospect is not the 'ideal client'."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective sales mastery involves 'uncovering the root' of the objection. Often, a price objection is actually a 'certainty objection'—the client doesn't doubt the price, but doubts whether the program will work specifically for them."

            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 5 found that 'Long-Tail Keywords' (e.g., 'Integrative coach for Hashimoto’s fatigue') have a significantly higher conversion rate than 'Head Terms' (e.g., 'Health Coach'). What is the reported average conversion increase for long-tail phrases?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15% higher",
                "Approximately 2.5x to 3x higher",
                "There is no measurable difference in conversion rates",
                "Head terms actually convert better due to higher search volume"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-tail keywords indicate high intent. While they have lower search volume, the users searching for them are much further along in the buying cycle, resulting in 2.5x to 3x higher conversion rates compared to broad terms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A lead magnet is a 'low friction' entry point into a coach's ecosystem. It must solve a specific problem quickly to build trust and allow the coach to follow up via email marketing."

                "It allows the coach to charge more per person than in 1-on-1 coaching.",
                "It reduces the legal liability of the coach since advice is given to a group."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Vicarious Learning' and social proof inherent in group coaching significantly boost client confidence. Seeing peers overcome similar obstacles validates the coach's methodology and motivates the individual."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FTC requires that testimonials be accompanied by clear disclosures if results are not typical, and state boards require a clear distinction that coaching is not the practice of medicine or nutrition dietetics."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ratio is calculated as $4,500 / $500 = 9. A 9:1 ratio is excellent (anything above 3:1 is generally considered healthy), indicating that for every $1 spent on marketing, the coach generates $9 in revenue over the client's lifetime."
