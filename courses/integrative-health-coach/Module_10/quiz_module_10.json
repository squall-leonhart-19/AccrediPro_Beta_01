        {
            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is synthesized in the gut by enterochromaffin cells, highlighting the significance of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "40-50%", "70-75%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 90-95% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract, where it regulates intestinal motility and communicates with the central nervous system via the vagus nerve."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Which protein is the primary physiological modulator of tight junctions, and when overexpressed, leads to increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)?",
            "options": ["Zonulin", "Occludin", "Claudin-1", "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions. High levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability and are often triggered by gluten (gliadin) or dysbiosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "The Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) represents approximately what percentage of the entire human immune system?",
            "options": ["30%", "50%", "70-80%", "95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The GALT houses approximately 70-80% of the body's immune cells, making the gut the primary site of interaction between the immune system and the external environment."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "During the Phase I detoxification process in the liver, the Cytochrome P450 enzymes transform toxins into intermediate metabolites. What is a critical characteristic of these intermediates?",
            "options": ["They are completely non-toxic and ready for excretion", "They are often more reactive and potentially more toxic than the original substance", "They are exclusively water-soluble", "They are stored in adipose tissue for later processing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase I biotransformation often creates highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intermediate metabolites that are more toxic than the parent compound. These require immediate neutralization by Phase II conjugation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client presents with an immediate (within minutes) localized swelling and hives after consuming shellfish. This reaction is mediated by which immunoglobulin?",
            "options": ["IgG", "IgA", "IgM", "IgE"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "IgE-mediated reactions are 'true' allergies involving Type I hypersensitivity, characterized by immediate onset and the release of histamine from mast cells."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "In the '5-R' Framework for gut restoration, what is the primary focus of the 'REPLACE' step?",
            "options": ["Using antimicrobial herbs to kill overgrowth", "Adding digestive enzymes, bile salts, or hydrochloric acid (HCl)", "Introducing high-dose multi-strain probiotics", "Providing L-glutamine to heal the mucosal lining"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Replace' step focuses on restoring digestive secretions (enzymes, HCl, bile) that may be deficient, ensuring proper breakdown of nutrients and prevention of further dysbiosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "How does chronic psychological stress typically affect the levels of Secretory IgA (sIgA) in the gut mucosa over time?",
            "options": ["It permanently increases sIgA, leading to over-active immunity", "It has no measurable effect on sIgA levels", "It eventually depletes sIgA, weakening the first line of immune defense", "It converts sIgA into IgG"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While acute stress may cause a temporary spike, chronic stress and elevated cortisol lead to the depletion of Secretory IgA (sIgA), which reduces the gut's ability to defend against pathogens."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a known mechanism of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like Bisphenol A (BPA) and Phthalates?",
            "options": ["They enhance the production of natural hormones", "They mimic or block natural hormones by binding to hormone receptors", "They convert water-soluble toxins into fat-soluble toxins", "They strengthen the intestinal tight junctions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs interfere with the endocrine system by mimicking natural hormones (like estrogen), blocking hormone receptors, or interfering with the production and metabolism of hormones."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia is defined by the translocation of which substance from the gut into systemic circulation?",
            "options": ["Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)", "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)", "L-Glutamine", "Butyrate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic endotoxemia occurs when Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)—pro-inflammatory components of Gram-negative bacteria—leak through the intestinal barrier into the bloodstream, triggering systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which Phase II liver detoxification pathway is specifically responsible for the neutralization of acetaminophen (paracetamol) and requires adequate levels of sulfur-containing amino acids?",
            "options": ["Acetylation", "Glucuronidation", "Sulfation", "Methylation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sulfation is a major Phase II pathway for neutralizing various drugs (including acetaminophen) and steroid hormones. It is dependent on inorganic sulfate and sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine and methionine."
