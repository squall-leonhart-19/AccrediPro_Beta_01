            "question": "Approximately 90-95% of which neurotransmitter is produced in the gut, primarily by enterochromaffin cells, and is heavily influenced by microbial diversity?",
            "options": [
                "Dopamine",
                "GABA",

            "options": [
                "Allergies are delayed by 72 hours; sensitivities are immediate.",
                "Allergies involve IgE antibodies and histamine release; sensitivities involve IgG/IgA and delayed systemic inflammation.",
                "Sensitivities always result in anaphylaxis; allergies only cause bloating.",
                "There is no clinical difference; the terms are interchangeable."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "True food allergies involve IgE and immediate mast cell degranulation. Sensitivities are typically mediated by IgG or IgA and manifest 12-72 hours post-ingestion."
