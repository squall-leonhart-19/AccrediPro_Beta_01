            "options": [
                "Waist circumference >102cm (men), Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL, and HDL <40 mg/dL (men)",
                "BMI >30, Blood pressure >120/80 mmHg, and Fasting Glucose >90 mg/dL",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The NCEP ATP III criteria include: Waist circumference (>102cm men/>88cm women), Triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL), HDL (<40 mg/dL men/<50 mg/dL women), Blood Pressure (≥130/85 mmHg), and Fasting Glucose (≥100 mg/dL)."

            "question": "Why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) frequently cited in advanced lipidology as a superior predictor of cardiovascular risk compared to LDL-C?",
            "options": [
                "ApoB measures the total weight of cholesterol within the particles",
                "ApoB represents the total number of atherogenic particles, as each contains exactly one ApoB molecule",
                "ApoB only measures the large, buoyant LDL particles which are the most dangerous",
                "ApoB levels fluctuate less than LDL-C in response to dietary saturated fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ApoB is a direct measure of the total number of atherogenic particles (including LDL, VLDL, and IDL). Since each particle contains one molecule of ApoB, it provides a more accurate count of the 'drivers' of atherosclerosis than the cholesterol volume (LDL-C)."

            "question": "The 'DASH' (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet has been shown in clinical trials to reduce systolic BP by approximately 6-11 mmHg. What is its primary nutritional mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Total elimination of sodium to under 500mg per day",
                "High intake of saturated fats to improve arterial compliance",
                "Increased intake of potassium, magnesium, and calcium to balance the sodium-potassium pump",
                "Focus on high-protein, low-carbohydrate intake to reduce insulin-induced sodium retention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The DASH diet works not just by moderate sodium restriction, but significantly through the high intake of minerals like potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which promote vasodilation and help the kidneys excrete excess sodium."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L-arginine is the direct precursor used by the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme to produce nitric oxide, which is essential for vasodilation and vascular homeostasis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "(18 x 105) / 405 = 4.66. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early resistance, while a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance and high metabolic risk."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The standard risk stratification for hs-CRP is: Low Risk (<1.0 mg/L), Average Risk (1.0-3.0 mg/L), and High Risk (>3.0 mg/L)."

            "options": [
                "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) exclusively",

                "Static stretching and flexibility work"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training (where lactate levels remain below 2.0 mmol/L) specifically targets Type I muscle fibers and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, improving the body's ability to switch between fuel sources (metabolic flexibility)."

            "options": [
                "It is easily cleared by the liver via the LDL receptor",
                "It contains an apolipoprotein(a) component that is structurally similar to plasminogen, promoting blood clots",
                "It only carries 'good' cholesterol to the heart",
                "It disappears completely when a client follows a ketogenic diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lp(a) is highly pro-thrombotic because its apolipoprotein(a) component interferes with fibrinolysis (the breakdown of clots) due to its structural similarity to plasminogen, in addition to being highly pro-atherogenic."

            "question": "A client's lipid panel shows Triglycerides of 220 mg/dL and HDL of 35 mg/dL. What does their TG/HDL ratio of 6.2 most likely suggest?",
            "options": [
                "A high likelihood of large, fluffy Pattern A LDL particles",
                "Optimal cardiovascular health",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A TG/HDL ratio greater than 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a strong surrogate marker for the presence of small dense LDL particles (Pattern B) and is highly correlated with insulin resistance."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "In the 'Metabolic Longevity' protocol, why is the timing of protein intake considered crucial when balancing mTOR activation and autophagy?",
            "options": [
                "Protein should be avoided entirely to prevent muscle growth",
                "Protein should be pulsed to allow for periods of mTOR suppression (autophagy) and mTOR activation (muscle protein synthesis)",
                "Protein must be eaten every 2 hours to keep blood sugar stable",
                "Protein is only useful if consumed with high-glycemic carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic longevity requires a balance between growth (mTOR) and repair (autophagy). Constant protein intake keeps mTOR chronically elevated, which may inhibit cellular cleanup (autophagy). Pulsing protein intake supports both muscle maintenance and cellular longevity."
