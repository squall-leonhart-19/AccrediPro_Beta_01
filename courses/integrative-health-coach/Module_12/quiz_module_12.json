        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "In the Neuro-Endo-Immune (NEI) Supersystem, which signaling molecule is primarily responsible for shifting tryptophan metabolism away from serotonin production and toward the neurotoxic Kynurenine pathway during chronic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)",
                "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)",
                "Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase",
                "Cortisol Binding Globulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha induce the enzyme IDO, which diverts tryptophan to the kynurenine pathway, reducing serotonin and potentially increasing neurotoxic quinolinic acid."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) produced by the gut microbiome is most directly linked to mitochondrial biogenesis via the activation of the PGC-1α pathway?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PPARγ is the master regulator of adipogenesis; many EDCs (Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals) trigger this receptor, causing the body to create more and larger fat cells."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation involves the attachment of glucuronic acid to toxins, making them water-soluble for excretion. It is the most common Phase II pathway for drugs and many environmental pollutants."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the HPA axis demands more cortisol, diverting the precursor pregnenolone away from the production of DHEA and Progesterone, leading to hormonal imbalances."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III detoxification refers to the transport and actual exit of toxins from the body; if bile flow or bowel motility is impaired, toxins can be reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation), causing further damage."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammation, often triggered by gut-derived LPS (endotoxins), can cross a compromised BBB and 'prime' microglia, making them hyper-reactive to future stressors."
