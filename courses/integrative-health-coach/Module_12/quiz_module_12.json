            "question": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is critical for neuroplasticity. According to recent meta-analyses, which intervention has been shown to produce the most significant acute increase in serum BDNF levels?",
            "options": [
                "Low-intensity steady-state walking (LISS)",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)",

                "A high-carbohydrate meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIIT has been shown in multiple studies to produce a more significant increase in BDNF compared to moderate-intensity continuous training, as the intensity triggers higher expression of the BDNF gene in the hippocampus."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client complains of 'reward deficiency syndrome,' characterized by low motivation, lack of pleasure (anhedonia), and a tendency toward addictive behaviors. Which neurotransmitter system should an Integrative Health Coach focus on supporting?",

            "explanation": "Flow states are characterized by a 'cocktail' of performance-enhancing neurochemicals (dopamine, norepinephrine, anandamide, serotonin, and endorphins). Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, typically decreases as the individual moves out of 'struggle' and into 'flow.'"

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammation activates the Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, which steals tryptophan (the precursor to serotonin) and converts it into kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which are neurotoxic."
