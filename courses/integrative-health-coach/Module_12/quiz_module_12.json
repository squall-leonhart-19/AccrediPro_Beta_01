            "options": [
                "Cytokines and chemokines",
                "Only steroid hormones",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cytokines and chemokines are the primary messengers that allow the immune system to communicate with the central nervous system, often signaling via the vagus nerve or through circumventricular organs."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Which specific protein, when elevated, is associated with increased permeability of both the intestinal barrier and the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to 'Leaky Brain'?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Methylation (via the COMT enzyme for estrogens) is a critical Phase II pathway for neutralizing catechol estrogens and certain heavy metals."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A client with a 'slow' COMT gene (genotype AA/Met-Met) is likely to experience which clinical manifestation due to impaired neurotransmitter breakdown?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'slow' COMT variant results in slower breakdown of catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine), leading to higher levels that can increase pain sensitivity and the duration of the stress response."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (HPA-G Axis Shunt) describes a state where chronic stress causes the body to prioritize the production of ________ over ________.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes the production of cortisol (survival hormone) using the precursor pregnenolone, which 'steals' from the production of sex hormones like progesterone."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase I converts toxins into intermediate metabolites that are often more reactive and toxic than the original substance. If Phase II cannot keep up, these intermediates cause significant oxidative stress."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Foundational work involves removing triggers (reducing toxic load) and restoring barrier integrity before moving to more aggressive detoxification or intensive physiological stressors."
