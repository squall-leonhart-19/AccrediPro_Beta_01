        {
            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is composed of approximately how many neurons, leading to its designation as the 'Second Brain'?",
            "options": [
                "10 million neurons",
                "50 million neurons",
                "500 million neurons",
                "5 billion neurons"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ENS contains approximately 500 million neurons, which is significantly more than the spinal cord, allowing it to operate autonomously from the Central Nervous System (CNS)."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "The Vagus nerve serves as the primary 'information superhighway' between the gut and brain. What percentage of its fibers are afferent (sensory), carrying signals from the gut to the brain?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "50%",
                "65-70%",
                "80-90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "80-90% of vagal fibers are afferent, meaning the vast majority of communication on the Vagus nerve is the gut 'telling' the brain about the internal environment rather than the brain commanding the gut."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which protein is recognized as the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions, serving as a key biomarker for intestinal permeability?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the primary regulator of tight junction permeability; high levels are associated with 'leaky gut' and the subsequent passage of antigens into the bloodstream."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are the primary endotoxins that trigger systemic inflammation and 'cytokine storms' when they translocate across a compromised intestinal barrier."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which 'keystone' bacterial species is critical for maintaining the gut's mucosal lining, with low levels being strongly correlated with obesity and Type 2 Diabetes?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila lives in the mucus layer and stimulates goblet cells to produce more mucus, maintaining the integrity of the barrier and protecting against endotoxemia."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the context of Nutritional Immunology, which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is the primary energy source for colonocytes and is essential for inducing T-regulatory cell production?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is the most critical SCFA for gut health, providing energy to the gut lining and acting as an epigenetic signaler to dampen inflammation through T-reg induction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Shikimate pathway is used by plants and many bacteria to synthesize essential amino acids; while humans lack this pathway, our microbiome relies on it, making it susceptible to glyphosate disruption."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic brain fog, joint pain, and an hs-CRP of 4.5 mg/L. Based on Module 15, which mechanism most likely explains the 'Neuro-Inflammation' they are experiencing?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammation (metabolic endotoxemia) causes cytokines and LPS to reach the blood-brain barrier, where they activate microglial cells (the brain's immune cells), leading to neuro-inflammation and symptoms like brain fog."
