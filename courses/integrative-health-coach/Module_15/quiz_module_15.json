            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the body's total serotonin is synthesized within the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) by enterochromaffin cells?",
            "options": [
                "10-15%",
                "45-50%",
                "70-75%",
                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The ENS, often called the 'Second Brain,' produces roughly 90-95% of the body's serotonin, which regulates not only GI motility but also mood and systemic signaling."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is considered the primary fuel source for colonocytes and plays a critical role in inducing T-regulatory cells to suppress systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Butyrate",
                "Acetate",
                "Propionate",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is essential for intestinal barrier integrity, providing energy to the gut lining and acting as a signaling molecule that promotes an anti-inflammatory immune response."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the research of Dr. Alessio Fasano discussed in Lesson 3, which protein is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions in the gut?",
            "options": [

                "Vinculin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the protein that regulates the opening of tight junctions; its overexpression, often triggered by gluten or dysbiosis, leads to increased intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which metric is considered the 'gold standard' for non-invasively assessing Vagus Nerve tone and the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates robust vagal tone and the ability of the body to transition effectively into the 'rest and digest' state, whereas low HRV is linked to chronic inflammation."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia is defined by a 2-3 fold increase in circulating levels of which substance, typically following a high-saturated fat meal in a dysbiotic individual?",

                "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Endotoxemia occurs when LPS (endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria) cross the gut barrier and enter systemic circulation, triggering low-grade chronic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which specific receptor does LPS bind to on the surface of immune cells to initiate the NF-κB signaling pathway and the subsequent 'cytokine storm'?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "TLR4 is the primary innate immune sensor for LPS. Its activation triggers a cascade that leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, which amino acid is highlighted as the primary 'structural' intervention for repairing the intestinal lining due to its role as a fuel source for rapidly dividing enterocytes?",

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Why is Glyphosate considered a significant microbiome disruptor even though the 'Shikimate pathway' it inhibits is not found in human cells?",
            "options": [
                "It causes direct mutations in human DNA",
                "It is found in the Shikimate pathway of beneficial gut bacteria, leading to dysbiosis",
                "It binds to human insulin receptors",
                "It only affects the skin microbiome, not the gut"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While humans lack the Shikimate pathway, many beneficial gut bacteria (like Bifidobacteria) use it. Glyphosate can therefore selectively kill beneficial flora, allowing pathogenic species to thrive."

            "question": "A client presents with 'Brain Fog,' joint pain, and bloating. If the mechanism is 'Leaky Gut, Leaky Brain,' which sequence of events is most likely occurring?",
            "options": [
                "LPS translocation -> TLR4 activation -> Systemic cytokines -> Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability -> Microglial activation",
                "Vagus nerve overactivity -> Low stomach acid -> LPS reduction -> BBB strengthening",
                "High HRV -> Increased Zonulin -> Decreased cytokines -> Brain fog",
                "Microglial dormancy -> Low LPS -> Intestinal permeability -> Joint pain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Gut-Brain-Immune' axis sequence involves gut permeability leading to LPS entry, which triggers systemic inflammation that eventually compromises the Blood-Brain Barrier and inflames the brain's immune cells (microglia)."
