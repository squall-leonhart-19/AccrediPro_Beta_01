            "question": "In the 'Root Cause Paradigm' discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary distinction between 'Upstream' and 'Downstream' interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Upstream interventions focus on pharmaceutical suppression, while downstream focuses on lifestyle.",
                "Upstream interventions address the fundamental biochemical drivers (e.g., oxidative stress), while downstream interventions treat resulting symptoms.",
                "Upstream refers to genetic editing, while downstream refers to nutritional supplementation.",
                "There is no distinction; both terms are used interchangeably in integrative health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Upstream interventions target the foundational causes—such as systemic inflammation or gut dysbiosis—that lead to the 'downstream' symptoms or diagnoses a client presents with."

                "It acts as a static barrier that prevents any environmental influence on the cell.",
                "The internal environment's pH, redox potential, and nutrient density dictate whether a cell functions optimally or enters a state of pathology.",
                "It is only relevant in acute infectious diseases, not chronic metabolic conditions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The biological terrain theory posits that the health of the fluid surrounding the cells (the milieu) is more important for long-term health than the presence of individual pathogens or triggers."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes the production of cortisol (the survival hormone) at the expense of 'luxury' hormones like progesterone and testosterone, often leading to hormonal imbalances."

            "options": [
                "Because hormones have no impact on the digestive system.",
                "Because systemic inflammation and nutrient malabsorption originating in the gut can mimic or cause endocrine dysfunction.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Foundational health requires a functional gut; if the gut is inflamed, it will disrupt the HPA axis and hormone metabolism, making hormonal interventions less effective."
