            "question": "According to the W.H.O.L.E. Health Method™ Assessment, which component of the acronym focuses on the physical and social surroundings that influence biological expression?",
            "options": ["Wellness", "Habits", "Objectives", "Environment"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'E' in W.H.O.L.E. stands for Environment, which encompasses both the internal (biological) and external (social/physical) factors that influence a client's health outcomes."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the Biopsychosocial Model, a client's 'Internalized Locus of Control' would be categorized under which domain?",
            "options": ["Biological factors", "Psychological factors", "Social factors", "Environmental factors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychological factors include cognitive processes, beliefs, and personality traits like the locus of control, which significantly impact how a client manages their health."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When mapping a Health Timeline, a client reports that their chronic fatigue began immediately after a severe viral infection three years ago. The infection is best classified as a(n):",
            "options": ["Antecedent", "Trigger", "Mediator", "Outcome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'Trigger' (or precipitating event) is an acute incident that initiates a shift from health to dysfunction, such as an infection, trauma, or major life stressor."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'Mediator' within the Health Timeline framework?",
            "options": ["A genetic predisposition present from birth", "An acute event that initiates symptoms", "Ongoing factors that contribute to the persistence of a condition", "The primary symptom the client wishes to resolve"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mediators (or Perpetuators) are ongoing factors—such as poor sleep, chronic stress, or nutritional deficiencies—that keep the pathological process active."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A functional lab interpretation differs from a conventional pathological interpretation because the functional range is typically:",
            "options": ["Broader, to include more of the population", "Narrower, to identify physiological shifts before disease occurs", "Based on the 95% confidence interval of the lab's local population", "Only used for emergency room triage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges are narrower than conventional 'normal' ranges; they are designed to identify sub-clinical dysfunction and promote optimal health rather than just the absence of disease."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In the context of Objective Data, a 2022 study highlighted that a 'Functional' range for HbA1c is generally considered to be 4.6% to 5.3%. What is the primary reason for using this range over the conventional <5.7%?",
            "options": ["To diagnose Type 1 Diabetes earlier", "To identify increased cardiovascular risk and glycation before reaching pre-diabetic levels", "To ensure the client qualifies for insurance-based interventions", "Because the 5.7% threshold is statistically insignificant"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine practitioners look for HbA1c levels between 4.6% and 5.3% because research indicates that cardiovascular risk begins to rise even within the 'normal' conventional range."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "When using the Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ), a total score of 85 would typically indicate:",
            "options": ["Low metabolic toxicity", "Moderate systemic burden", "High/Severe systemic burden", "An invalid test result"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "On the MSQ, scores over 70-80 generally indicate a high systemic burden or significant 'toxic load,' requiring immediate lifestyle and/or clinical intervention."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the Matrix Mapping Technique, which element sits at the center of the 'Core,' influencing all other functional systems?",
            "options": ["Assimilation and Digestion", "Defense and Repair", "Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual (M.E.S.)", "Communication and Hormones"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual (M.E.S.) node is the center of the Matrix because a client’s internal state and belief systems modulate their physiological responses across all other systems."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Pre-contemplation' stage of change regarding their smoking habit but is in 'Action' regarding their exercise routine. How should the coach synthesize this assessment?",
            "options": ["Focus exclusively on smoking since it is the highest health risk", "Use a 'one-size-fits-all' coaching strategy for both goals", "Employ motivational interviewing for smoking while providing structured programming for exercise", "Wait until the client reaches 'Action' for both before starting the program"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Readiness for change is behavior-specific. A coach must triage interventions by matching their style to the client's current stage for each specific habit."

            "question": "Which 'Root Cause Analysis' tool involves asking 'Why' five times to drill down from a surface symptom to a foundational imbalance?",
            "options": ["The Matrix Map", "The 5-Whys Technique", "The Biopsychosocial Grid", "The Functional Systems Review"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-Whys is a root cause analysis technique used to move past the 'What' (symptom) to the 'Why' (foundational cause or antecedent)."
