            "question": "What is the fundamental distinction between the 'Salutogenic' model used in Integrative Health and the traditional 'Pathogenic' medical model?",
            "options": [
                "The Pathogenic model focuses on prevention, while the Salutogenic model focuses on emergency surgery.",
                "The Salutogenic model focuses on the origins of health and well-being, while the Pathogenic model focuses on the origins of disease.",
                "The Pathogenic model uses only natural remedies, while the Salutogenic model uses pharmaceuticals.",
                "There is no functional difference; they are synonymous terms in modern medicine."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As discussed in Lesson 1, Salutogenesis (coined by Aaron Antonovsky) focuses on factors that support human health and resilience, whereas the Pathogenic model focuses primarily on factors that cause disease (pathogenesis)."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the ALIGN Method™, the 'A' in the acronym stands for 'Assess Systems, Not Symptoms.' What does this systemic approach prioritize?",
            "options": [
                "Treating the single loudest symptom the client presents with first.",
                "Using a standardized meal plan for every client regardless of their history.",
                "Evaluating the interconnectedness of biological systems to find the root cause of dysfunction.",
                "Focusing exclusively on physical fitness metrics like BMI and heart rate."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ALIGN Method™ shifts the focus from 'symptom-chasing' to understanding how various body systems (gut, endocrine, nervous) interact and influence one another."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the science of Epigenetics covered in Lesson 3, what is the significance of 'gene expression' for an Integrative Health Coach?",
            "options": [
                "Genes are fixed at birth and cannot be influenced by lifestyle interventions.",
                "Genetic testing is the only way to determine a client's health outcomes.",
                "Lifestyle factors like nutrition, stress, and sleep act as 'switches' that can turn certain genes on or off.",
                "Epigenetics only applies to hereditary diseases and has no impact on general wellness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Epigenetics teaches us that while our DNA sequence is fixed, the expression of those genes is highly fluid and influenced by environmental and lifestyle inputs."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses the 'Whole-Person Wellness' model. Which system is often referred to as the 'Second Brain' due to its extensive enteric nervous system and influence on mood?",

                "The Musculoskeletal System"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis demonstrates that the gastrointestinal system contains millions of neurons and produces the majority of the body's serotonin, earning it the nickname 'the second brain.'"

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "When evaluating clinical research (Lesson 5), why is a meta-analysis generally considered higher quality evidence than a single case study?",
            "options": [
                "It is written by a single famous author.",
                "It synthesizes data from multiple randomized controlled trials to provide a more robust conclusion.",
                "It focuses on a single person's unique experience over a long period.",
                "It is usually funded by the supplement industry to ensure positive results."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the hierarchy of evidence, meta-analyses and systematic reviews sit at the top because they aggregate findings from multiple high-quality studies, reducing the risk of bias found in single studies."

            "question": "A client comes to you with a diagnosis of Clinical Depression and asks you to adjust their medication dosage. Based on Lesson 7 (Ethics & Scope), what is the correct response?",

                "Suggest they cut the pill in half to see how they feel.",
                "Recommend a specific herbal supplement to replace the medication.",
                "State that adjusting medication is outside your scope of practice and refer them to their prescribing physician.",
                "Tell them that lifestyle changes alone will cure the depression so they don't need the meds."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Health coaches must never diagnose, treat, or prescribe. Adjusting medication is strictly the domain of licensed medical professionals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that for the majority of chronic conditions, lifestyle and environment (epigenetics) play a much larger role (approx. 80%) than fixed genetic inheritance (approx. 20%)."
