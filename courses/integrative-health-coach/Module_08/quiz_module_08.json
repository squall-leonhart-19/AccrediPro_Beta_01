            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ectopic lipids activate protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, which inhibit the Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1), effectively blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway and preventing GLUT4 translocation."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "The concept of 'Mitohormesis' suggests that which of the following is necessary for long-term mitochondrial health and cellular resilience?",

            "question": "A client undergoes a Metabolic Cart test and shows a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.82 during a moderate-intensity walk. What does this value indicate regarding their metabolic flexibility?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 reflects pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 reflects pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.82 indicates a mixed fuel utilization, which is typical for moderate intensity."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin increases fatty acid oxidation and insulin sensitivity. Unlike most adipokines, its levels decrease as visceral fat mass increases."

            "options": [
                "It burns the most total calories per minute compared to HIIT",
                "It specifically targets and improves the mitochondrial capacity for fatty acid oxidation",
                "It maximizes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zone 2 training occurs at the intensity where fat oxidation is maximized (FatMax), stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing the density of MCT-1 transporters."

                "It has no measurable effect on healthy individuals",
                "It can reduce insulin sensitivity by as much as 25-30%",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Donga et al., 2010) show that a single night of partial sleep deprivation can induce acute insulin resistance comparable to that of a person with Type 2 Diabetes."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "When designing a protocol using the WHOLE Health Method™, why is 'Nervous System Regulation' addressed before 'Intensive Exercise'?",
            "options": [
                "Because exercise is not effective for weight loss",
                "To ensure the client is in a 'Safe-to-Heal' state where they can recover from the stress of exercise",
                "Because exercise increases AGEs and should be avoided",
                "To prioritize the 'Environment' pillar over the 'Movement' pillar"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a client is in chronic sympathetic dominance (fight/flight), the added stress of high-intensity exercise can exacerbate cortisol dysfunction and systemic inflammation rather than promoting repair."
