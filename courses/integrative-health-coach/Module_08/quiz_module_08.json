            "question": "Research on Emotional Intelligence (EQ) suggests that individuals with higher 'Emotional Regulation' scores exhibit which physiological advantage during stressful events?",
            "options": [
                "A total absence of cortisol production during acute stress",
                "A faster return to baseline cortisol levels following a stressor",
                "Permanently elevated sympathetic nervous system activity",
                "Increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High EQ is associated with physiological resilience; specifically, the ability to recover quickly from the 'cortisol spike' of a stressor, preventing prolonged systemic exposure to stress hormones."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, the concept of 'Allostatic Load' is defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The maximum amount of weight an individual can lift during resistance training",
                "The physiological 'wear and tear' resulting from chronic overactivity or underactivity of stress-response systems",
                "The psychological capacity to endure trauma without any emotional response",
                "A measurement of caloric intake versus energy expenditure in metabolic health"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load represents the cumulative biological cost to the body when the 'fight or flight' response is chronically activated, leading to secondary health outcomes like hypertension and insulin resistance."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the meta-analysis by Holt-Lunstad (2010) cited in Lesson 3, social isolation carries a mortality risk comparable to smoking how many cigarettes per day?",

                "25 cigarettes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The landmark 2010 meta-analysis of 148 studies found that weak social connections are as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and more harmful than obesity or physical inactivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Strong purpose and meaning (Ikigai) are linked to longevity; the JAMA Psychiatry meta-analysis found a 17% reduction in all-cause mortality among those with a high sense of purpose."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "In the Bridges Transition Model discussed in Lesson 5, what characterizes the 'Neutral Zone'?",
            "options": [
                "The immediate excitement of starting a new health habit",
                "The initial stage of letting go of old identities and behaviors",
                "A period of uncertainty and confusion where the 'old' is gone but the 'new' isn't fully operational",
                "The final stage where the client has fully integrated their new lifestyle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Neutral Zone is the 'in-between' phase where the most critical psychological realignments happen, though it often feels uncomfortable or unproductive for the client."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "When using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) as a biohacking tool, a consistently 'High' HRV reading generally indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Dominance of the sympathetic nervous system and high stress",
                "A state of overtraining and potential cardiovascular fatigue",
                "Strong parasympathetic tone and better autonomic nervous system flexibility",
                "An irregular heartbeat that requires immediate medical intervention"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV (the variation in time between heartbeats) is a marker of a resilient autonomic nervous system and strong parasympathetic (rest and digest) activity."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "During the transition from 'Coach-Led' to 'Self-Management' (Lesson 7), what is the primary indicator that a client is ready for maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "The client has reached their target weight or biomarker goal",
                "The client has shifted from extrinsic motivation to intrinsic motivation and high self-efficacy",
                "The client has purchased all the necessary biohacking equipment",
                "The client no longer experiences any setbacks or lapses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability depends on 'Intrinsic Motivation' (doing it for internal satisfaction) and 'Self-Efficacy' (the belief in one's ability to handle challenges without external prompting)."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "What is the clinical difference between a 'Lapse' and a 'Relapse' in the context of sustainable health maintenance?",
            "options": [
                "There is no difference; both indicate failure",
                "A lapse is a temporary slip; a relapse is a sustained return to old patterns and abandonment of goals",
                "A relapse is a one-time event; a lapse lasts for at least three months",
                "Lapses are physiological, while relapses are purely psychological"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Distinguishing between a lapse (a single 'off' day) and a relapse (returning to the prior baseline) is critical for resilience and preventing the 'abstinence violation effect' where one mistake leads to total surrender."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which 'Biohacking' technology is primarily used to optimize circadian rhythms and cellular energy production by stimulating cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red light therapy (660nm-850nm) works by interacting with the mitochondria, specifically cytochrome c oxidase, to increase ATP production and reduce oxidative stress."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "To measure the 'Long-Term Success' of an intervention beyond weight loss, which metric provides the best insight into the client's health-related quality of life?",
            "options": [
                "Body Mass Index (BMI)",
                "Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)",
                "Total daily caloric intake",
                "Number of social media followers on their health journey"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PROMs are validated surveys that capture the client's own perception of their functional status and well-being, which are often better predictors of long-term adherence than clinical markers alone."
