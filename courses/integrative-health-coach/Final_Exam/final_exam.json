                "It focuses on suppressing acute symptoms through botanical supplementation.",
                "It prioritizes identifying and addressing the biological root causes and systemic imbalances.",
                "It involves the creation of a 12-week exercise and movement protocol.",
                "It is the phase where the coach provides a clinical diagnosis for the client's condition."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in the W.H.O.L.E. Method stands for Optimize Function, which shifts the focus from symptom suppression to addressing underlying root causes (e.g., gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, or hormonal dysregulation) to restore systemic balance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and high cortisol levels interfere with the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 by inhibiting the 5'-deiodinase enzyme, leading to higher levels of the metabolic 'brake,' Reverse T3 (rT3)."

                "The body stores toxins in adipose tissue to prevent systemic damage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification involves conjugation pathways (e.g., glucuronidation, sulfation, glutathione conjugation) where the liver adds a substance to the intermediate metabolite to make it water-soluble and safe for excretion."
