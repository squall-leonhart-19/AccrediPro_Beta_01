            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "In the study of Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), chronic activation of the HPA axis typically leads to which shift in the immune response?",
            "options": [
                "A permanent increase in all white blood cell counts",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol promote a Th2 shift, which suppresses cellular immunity (Th1) and can exacerbate allergic and inflammatory responses."

        {
            "id": "q9_3",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in the Gut-Immune Axis lesson, roughly 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut, making the microbiome a primary regulator of systemic immunity."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "Which mechanism describes how a pathogen (like Epstein-Barr Virus) can trigger autoimmunity because its proteins resemble the host's own tissue proteins?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign antigen with a self-antigen due to structural similarities, leading to an attack on host tissues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like Bisphenol A (BPA) primarily cause health issues by which mechanism?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs are exogenous substances that interfere with any aspect of hormone action, often by binding to estrogen or androgen receptors due to their structural similarity to endogenous hormones."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the liver's detoxification process, why is it critical that Phase II conjugation pathways keep pace with Phase I biotransformation?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I makes toxins more fat-soluble for storage",
                "Phase II is responsible for the initial breakdown of heavy metals",
                "Phase I creates highly reactive, toxic intermediate metabolites that must be neutralized by Phase II",
                "Phase II produces the oxygen required for Phase I to function"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I often creates reactive intermediates (free radicals) that are more toxic than the original substance. Phase II must quickly conjugate these to prevent cellular damage."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to immune activation primarily through the release of what into the cytosol, which triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When mitochondria are damaged, they release mtDNA and ROS into the cytoplasm, which are recognized as 'danger signals,' activating the inflammasome and promoting inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase III involves the excretion of toxins via bile and stool. If a client is constipated, conjugated toxins can be deconjugated by gut bacteria and reabsorbed, increasing toxicity."
