            "id": "q34_1",
            "question": "According to Tuckman’s Stages of Group Development, in which phase do participants typically begin to challenge the coach's authority and engage in subtle power struggles?",
            "options": ["Forming", "Storming", "Norming", "Performing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Storming' phase is characterized by conflict, competition for status, and testing of boundaries as the initial 'honeymoon' period of the Forming stage ends."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "When designing a 12-week wellness curriculum, what is the primary purpose of 'Instructional Scaffolding'?",
            "options": ["Providing temporary support structures that are gradually removed as the client gains autonomy", "Creating a rigid week-by-week schedule that cannot be altered", "Focusing exclusively on the most difficult concepts in the first week", "Ensuring all participants achieve the exact same biometric results"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves providing tools and support that help learners bridge the gap between what they can do alone and what they can do with assistance, eventually leading to self-efficacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A facilitator notices a 'Dominator' in a group session who is preventing others from sharing. Which advanced facilitation technique is most appropriate to rebalance the energy?",
            "options": ["Publicly reprimanding the participant for talking too much", "Ending the session early to prevent further disruption", "The 'Gatekeeper' technique: 'I'd love to pause there and hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet'", "Ignoring the participant until they stop talking on their own"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Gatekeeper technique professionally redirects the flow of conversation to ensure inclusivity without shaming the high-energy participant."

        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Group Bio-Metrics,' what does a high 'Coefficient of Variation' (CV) in group-wide Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data typically indicate?",
            "options": ["The group is perfectly synchronized in their recovery cycles", "There is significant heterogeneity in how group members are responding to the intervention", "The entire group is experiencing overtraining syndrome", "The biometric sensors are likely malfunctioning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high CV indicates a wide spread in the data, suggesting that participants are responding differently to the program, which may require more individualized sub-grouping."

            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "In Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle, which stage involves participants making sense of an experience by looking for patterns and inconsistencies?",
            "options": ["Concrete Experience", "Reflective Observation", "Abstract Conceptualization", "Active Experimentation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective Observation is the stage where learners step back from the 'doing' to reflect on the experience and observe it from different perspectives."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "Research on 'Social Contagion' in wellness groups suggests that if a participant has a close friend in the group who loses weight, their own chance of success increases by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": ["15%", "32%", "57%", "85%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies by Christakis and Fowler (2007) found that social networks significantly influence health behaviors, with a 57% increased likelihood of weight loss success when a peer in the network is successful."

        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "When measuring 'Longitudinal Cohort Success,' which metric is considered a 'Lagging Indicator'?",
            "options": ["Weekly attendance rates", "HbA1c levels at the 6-month post-program follow-up", "Number of logins to the digital portal", "Initial baseline motivation scores"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lagging indicators are outcomes that occur after the intervention is complete (like long-term blood markers), whereas leading indicators (like attendance) predict future success."

        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "In a 'Hybrid Delivery System,' what is the primary benefit of the 'Flipped Classroom' model?",
            "options": ["It reduces the total amount of content the coach has to create", "It allows live sessions to focus on high-value application and coaching rather than passive lecturing", "It eliminates the need for any live interaction", "It ensures that only the most tech-savvy clients can participate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "By delivering didactic content asynchronously (videos/reading), the coach can use expensive 'live' time for deep-dive coaching, troubleshooting, and experiential exercises."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key requirement for a 'Premium' group program launch according to the 'Product Launch Formula' principles?",
            "options": ["Keeping the program open for enrollment indefinitely", "Focusing only on the price rather than the transformation", "Creating a 'Pre-Launch Content' (PLC) sequence that builds authority and solves a small problem", "Avoiding the use of testimonials to keep the program mysterious"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PLC (Pre-Launch Content) is essential for demonstrating value, building trust, and moving the 'mental trigger' of authority before the cart opens."

            "options": ["Significantly worse clinical outcomes", "Equivalent clinical outcomes with higher cost-efficiency and social support", "Higher dropout rates due to lack of privacy", "No measurable change in patient self-efficacy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Large-scale data shows that group coaching provides equivalent (and sometimes superior) clinical outcomes while being more scalable and providing the added benefit of peer support."
