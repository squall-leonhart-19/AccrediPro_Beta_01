            "question": "According to the 'Ringelmann Effect' discussed in the psychology of group dynamics, what happens to individual productivity as group size increases, and how should a coach respond?",
            "options": [
                "Productivity increases linearly; the coach should maximize group size to 25+.",
                "Individual effort decreases as the group grows; the coach should implement individual accountability bio-metrics.",
                "Productivity peaks at 12 members; the coach should maintain this 'Golden Ratio'.",
                "Effort remains stagnant; the coach should focus solely on the group leader."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ringelmann Effect (Social Loafing) describes the tendency for individual productivity to decrease as group size increases. To mitigate this, coaches must use individual accountability measures and smaller 'breakout' dynamics."

            "question": "During the 'Storming' phase of group development, a participant begins to challenge the coach's authority regarding a nutritional protocol. What is the most effective facilitation strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately remove the participant to maintain group safety.",
                "Validate the concern and pivot to a 'Group Agreement' review to refacilitate safety and boundaries.",
                "Ignore the challenge and continue with the planned curriculum to maintain momentum.",
                "Publicly defend the protocol using clinical data to assert expertise."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the Storming phase, conflict is a natural part of group cohesion. Validating the participant while returning to established group norms/agreements helps the group transition into the 'Norming' phase."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that synchronized Heart Rate Variability (HRV) within a group—known as Group Coherence—is a leading indicator of psychological safety and collective efficacy in wellness programs."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case studies show that involving the initial 'Beta' cohort in the program's evolution creates a 'Founding Member' effect, increasing retention and buy-in by approximately 22% compared to static launches."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While bio-metrics are important, the Self-Efficacy Scale (the participant's belief in their ability to maintain the habit) is the strongest longitudinal predictor of long-term success."

            "options": [
                "To replace the need for a live coach entirely.",
                "To deliver foundational knowledge (Cognitive Load) so live sessions can focus on high-level coaching and connection.",
                "To reduce the cost of the program for the coach.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Flipped Classroom' or Hybrid model uses asynchronous content to handle the 'Cognitive Load' (facts/theory), allowing the precious 'Synchronous' time to be used for transformation, coaching, and group interaction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective facilitation uses 'Gatekeeping' to redirect the flow. By validating the speaker ('I want to pause you there') and immediately naming another participant, the coach rebalances the group energy without shaming."
