            "explanation": "Digital products decouple time from revenue. Once the asset is created, the marginal cost of selling to an additional student is near zero, leading to significantly higher profit margins than labor-intensive 1:1 services."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "CAC is calculated as Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Clients ($2,000 / 20 = $100). Since the LTV ($1,500) is 15x the CAC, the campaign is highly sustainable."
