            "question": "In the context of 'Legal Foundations,' what is the primary distinction between 'Medical Nutrition Therapy' (MNT) and 'Health Coaching' recommendations?",
            "options": [
                "Health coaches can prescribe specific dosages of supplements, while MNT cannot.",
                "MNT involves treating a specific disease or pathology, while coaching focuses on education and lifestyle support.",
                "Health coaches are legally allowed to interpret blood labs for diagnostic purposes in all 50 states.",
                "There is no legal distinction as long as the coach has a certification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MNT is a clinical intervention used to treat specific medical conditions and is typically restricted to Licensed Dietitians or Medical Doctors. Health coaches must focus on education, habit formation, and wellness support to stay within their legal scope of practice."

            "question": "When applying 'Strategic Brand Positioning,' why is a 'Generalist' approach often detrimental to a high-ticket practice?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the Total Addressable Market (TAM) too much for a single coach to handle.",
                "It leads to 'Expertise Dilution' and higher Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) due to lack of specific resonance.",
                "Generalists are legally required to charge lower fees by the FTC.",
                "Generalist brands require less marketing spend but more administrative work."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Generalist positioning makes it difficult to stand out in a saturated market. Niche mastery allows for 'Expertise Resonance,' which lowers CAC because the marketing message speaks directly to a specific problem, justifying higher premium pricing."

            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Value-Based Pricing' model in Lesson 3, how should a coach determine the price of a 6-month high-ticket program?",
            "options": [
                "By calculating the total number of hours spent and multiplying by a competitive hourly rate.",
                "By matching the lowest price offered by competitors in the local area.",
                "By assessing the 'Cost of Inaction' for the client and the lifetime value of the transformation provided.",
                "By adding a 20% markup to the coach's monthly personal living expenses."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing focuses on the outcome and the 'Cost of Inaction' (e.g., the health, financial, and emotional costs of the client remaining in their current state) rather than the hours of labor performed by the coach."

            "question": "A 2023 analysis of high-performing health practices found that 'Lead-to-Discovery Call' conversion rates typically fall within which range for organic social media funnels?",

                "40% to 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In organic marketing systems (Lesson 4), a healthy conversion rate from a lead (someone engaging with content/opting in) to a booked discovery call is typically 5-12%. Rates above 15% usually indicate a highly warm audience or a very narrow niche."

                "A physical filing cabinet in a locked office"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The EHR/Practice Management system serves as the centralized 'Single Point of Truth' for client data, session notes, and compliance documentation, ensuring HIPAA/GDPR standards are met and operations are streamlined."

            "options": [
                "It may cannibalize the high-ticket 1-on-1 sales by offering a 'cheaper way out'.",
                "It requires a high-level medical license to sell digital products.",
                "Passive income is taxed at a much higher rate than service income.",
                "It decreases the coach's authority in the eyes of the IRS."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If a low-ticket product is launched before the high-ticket offer is stabilized, it can distract the coach and lead potential high-value clients to choose the cheaper option, which often yields lower transformation results and lower practice revenue."

                "90-95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "B2B referrals from trusted sources (like functional medicine clinics or gyms) carry 'transferred trust,' which significantly shortens the sales cycle and can reduce CAC by 50-70% compared to cold traffic like Facebook ads."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Solopreneur's Trap occurs when the coach is the sole provider for every task (admin, marketing, delivery). Scaling requires moving from 'In-the-Business' tasks to 'On-the-Business' leadership to prevent burnout and plateaus."

                "Give her the dosage but make her sign a verbal waiver first."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches should provide 'Educational Information' rather than 'Medical Advice.' By citing research and deferring the final decision/dosage to her physician, the coach stays within their scope of practice while remaining helpful."
