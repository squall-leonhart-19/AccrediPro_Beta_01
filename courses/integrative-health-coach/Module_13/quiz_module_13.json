        {
            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "In the bidirectional communication of the Gut-Brain Axis, what percentage of the Vagus nerve fibers are afferent (sending signals from the gut to the brain)?",
            "options": ["Approximately 20%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 80-90%", "Less than 10%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve is predominantly afferent, with 80-90% of its fibers dedicated to transmitting sensory information from the visceral organs (the gut) back to the brain, highlighting the gut's influence on mental state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Which 'keystone' microbial species is specifically known for its ability to degrade mucin and strengthen the intestinal barrier, with low levels often associated with obesity and Type 2 Diabetes?",
            "options": ["Lactobacillus acidophilus", "Akkermansia muciniphila", "Escherichia coli", "Bifidobacterium longum"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a critical mucin-degrading bacterium that promotes the thickness of the mucus layer and maintains the integrity of the gut barrier."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are categorized as 'obesogens' because they interfere with endocrine signaling. What is their primary mechanism of action regarding adipose tissue?",
            "options": ["They decrease the number of fat cells through apoptosis", "They activate PPAR-gamma, promoting the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature fat cells", "They inhibit insulin receptors, preventing glucose uptake", "They increase metabolic rate by stimulating the thyroid"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many endocrine disruptors act as obesogens by activating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which triggers the creation of new fat cells and increases fat storage."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client presents with 'pathological detoxifier' symptoms: they react poorly to caffeine and supplements but feel worse during a fast. Which detoxification scenario does this likely describe?",
            "options": ["Overactive Phase I with sluggish Phase II conjugation", "Sluggish Phase I with overactive Phase II", "Impaired Phase III (Bile flow) only", "Excessive mitochondrial biogenesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When Phase I (CYP450 enzymes) is highly active but Phase II (conjugation) is slow, intermediate metabolites (which are often more toxic than the original substance) build up, causing significant adverse reactions."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "What protein is the primary modulator of tight junctions in the gut, and is often elevated in cases of 'Leaky Gut' and autoimmune triggers?",
            "options": ["Albumin", "Zonulin", "Hemoglobin", "Glutathione"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; high levels increase intestinal permeability, allowing Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the bloodstream."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which immunoglobulin is typically associated with delayed food sensitivities (Type III hypersensitivity) that may manifest 24-72 hours after ingestion?",
            "options": ["IgE", "IgA", "IgG", "IgM"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IgG antibodies are responsible for delayed food sensitivities, whereas IgE antibodies mediate immediate, classic allergic reactions like anaphylaxis or hives."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In Mitochondrial Bioenergetics, what is the role of the master regulator protein PGC-1alpha?",
            "options": ["It breaks down glucose into pyruvate", "It triggers mitochondrial biogenesis (the creation of new mitochondria)", "It acts as a primary antioxidant in the cytoplasm", "It transports fatty acids across the cell membrane"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha) is the master regulator that signals the cell to produce more mitochondria in response to exercise or caloric restriction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "According to the W.H.O.L.E. Method taught in Lesson 8, what does the 'O' represent in the integrated case management framework?",
            "options": ["Organize Supplements", "Optimize Detoxification & Drainage", "Observe Behavioral Patterns", "Oxygenate the Tissues"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the W.H.O.L.E. Method, 'O' stands for Optimize Detoxification & Drainage, ensuring that the body can effectively remove toxins once the gut and diet are addressed."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Data from the American Gut Project suggests that individuals who consume more than how many different types of plants per week have significantly higher microbial diversity?",
            "options": ["5 types", "10 types", "30 types", "50 types"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The American Gut Project found that 30+ different plant types per week is the 'magic number' for maximizing microbiome diversity and reducing antibiotic resistance genes."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Which nutrient is a critical cofactor for the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and is often depleted by statin medications, leading to mitochondrial fatigue?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone)", "Vitamin D3", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is essential for transporting electrons within the mitochondria; since statins inhibit the same pathway that produces CoQ10 (the mevalonate pathway), depletion often causes muscle pain and fatigue."
