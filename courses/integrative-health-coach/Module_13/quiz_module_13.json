            "question": "When managing a client with multiple co-morbidities (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, and Insomnia), which area does the ALIGN Method™ prioritize for initial intervention to create a systemic 'domino effect'?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive carbohydrate restriction to lower HbA1c immediately",
                "Circadian rhythm and sleep hygiene optimization",
                "High-intensity interval training to improve cardiovascular output",
                "Introduction of multiple targeted supplements for each condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, stabilizing the circadian rhythm and sleep (Lesson 1) often yields the highest ROI, as sleep deprivation directly exacerbates insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, making other interventions more effective."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "During the 'Listen' phase of the ALIGN initial consultation, what is the primary objective of the 'Timeline Mapping' technique?",
            "options": [
                "To document every supplement the client has ever taken",
                "To identify the 'Mediators' that keep the current symptoms active",
                "To connect Antecedents, Triggers, and Mediators to the client's health history",
                "To provide the client with a 12-month projection of their recovery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Timeline Mapping (Lesson 2) is used to visualize the relationship between life events (Antecedents), the onset of illness (Triggers), and the factors sustaining the illness (Mediators)."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Two-Variable Rule' discussed in Lesson 3, how many major protocol changes should be made during a progress review if a client has stalled?",
            "options": [
                "No more than two major variables should be changed at once to maintain data integrity",
                "At least three variables must be changed to 'shock' the metabolism",
                "Only one variable can ever be changed in a 30-day period",
                "All variables should be changed simultaneously if progress has stopped for 14 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Two-Variable Rule (Lesson 3) prevents 'shotgunning' interventions. By limiting changes to two variables, the coach can accurately identify which adjustment caused the specific physiological response."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In the context of the elderly population, what is the 'Protein Leverage' threshold typically required to stimulate Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) and combat sarcopenia?",
            "options": [
                "0.4g per kg of body weight per day",
                "0.8g per kg of body weight per day",
                "1.2g to 1.5g per kg of body weight per day",
                "3.0g per kg of body weight per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that elderly populations require higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5g/kg) than the standard RDA due to 'anabolic resistance,' where the body becomes less efficient at utilizing amino acids for muscle maintenance."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "When using the SBAR protocol to collaborate with a client's physician, what information belongs in the 'B' (Background) section?",
            "options": [
                "The specific clinical recommendation you are making",
                "The client's current vital signs and immediate symptoms",
                "Relevant clinical history, previous lab trends, and current protocol",
                "A subjective assessment of the client's emotional state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The Background (Lesson 5) provides the context necessary for the physician to understand the client's journey and previous data points."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "A client experiencing 'Metabolic Adaptation' after 12 weeks of weight loss shows a decrease in TDEE. What is the most appropriate 'Troubleshooting' intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Further reducing caloric intake by 25%",
                "Implementing a 'Diet Break' or 'Maintenance Phase' for 1-2 weeks",

                "Eliminating all dietary fats to increase the thermic effect of food"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 6 teaches that metabolic adaptation is a survival mechanism. A strategic diet break or maintenance phase helps restore leptin levels and thyroid hormone conversion, effectively 'resetting' the metabolic rate."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In Advanced Lab Interpretation, what is the primary difference between a 'Functional Range' and a 'Pathological Range'?",
            "options": [
                "Functional ranges are wider and less specific",
                "Pathological ranges identify the absence of disease; Functional ranges identify optimal physiological performance",
                "Pathological ranges are only used by medical doctors, while Functional ranges are used by insurance companies",
                "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As detailed in Lesson 7, Functional Ranges are narrower and based on optimal health markers, whereas Pathological Ranges are broader and used primarily to diagnose late-stage disease states."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis cited in the course indicates that Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) can occur in athletes when energy availability drops below which threshold?",

                "50% of total daily energy expenditure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 discusses RED-S, noting that physiological impairments (hormonal, bone health, metabolic) often begin when energy availability falls below 30 kcal/kg of FFM/day."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "During the 'G' (Goal Setting) phase of the ALIGN Method™, what is the 'Rule of Three' for client compliance?",
            "options": [
                "The client must achieve 3 goals per week or the protocol is failing",
                "Never assign more than 3 new habits or protocol changes at one time",
                "The coach must follow up with the client every 3 days",
                "Every goal must have 3 different sub-tasks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of Three (Lesson 8) is a clinical mastery tool used to prevent client overwhelm. Focusing on a maximum of three changes ensures higher adherence and better psychological buy-in."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "When interpreting a Lipid Panel, which ratio is considered a more significant predictor of cardiovascular risk than Total Cholesterol alone?",
            "options": [
                "The Vitamin D to Calcium ratio",
                "The Triglyceride to HDL ratio",

                "The Sodium to Potassium ratio"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 7 emphasizes that the Triglyceride:HDL ratio is a potent marker for insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles, providing more clinical insight than total cholesterol."
