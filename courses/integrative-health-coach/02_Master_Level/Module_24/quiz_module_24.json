            "question": "When analyzing functional labs, a practitioner observes a GGT level of 35 U/L and a Ferritin level of 250 ng/mL in a female client. According to functional medicine ranges, what is the most likely clinical concern?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges are broad, functional ranges suggest that GGT >30 and elevated Ferritin are early markers of oxidative stress and liver inflammation."
