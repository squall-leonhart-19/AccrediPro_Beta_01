            "question": "In Advanced Clinical Reasoning, what is the primary difference between 'System 1' and 'System 2' thinking when evaluating complex client patterns?",
            "options": [
                "System 1 is analytical and slow; System 2 is intuitive and fast.",
                "System 1 is fast and heuristic-based; System 2 is slow, effortful, and logical.",
                "System 1 focuses on lab data; System 2 focuses on subjective symptoms.",
                "System 1 is used for acute care; System 2 is used for chronic wellness."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on dual-process theory, System 1 is rapid, automatic, and prone to bias, while System 2 is the analytical, deliberate reasoning required for complex root-cause analysis in master-level coaching."

            "question": "When analyzing Functional Labs, a 'Functional Range' for High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) is typically considered optimal when it is below which level?",
            "options": [
                "3.0 mg/L",
                "1.0 mg/L",
                "5.0 mg/L",
                "10.0 mg/L"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While pathological ranges often accept up to 3.0 mg/L, functional medicine practitioners look for hs-CRP below 1.0 mg/L as a marker of optimal systemic inflammation management."

        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client presents with high anxiety and a 'metabolic' COMT polymorphism (Slow COMT). Which epigenetic coaching strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increase high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to burn off catecholamines.",
                "Supplement with high-dose methyl-donors immediately.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow COMT individuals break down stress hormones more slowly. Reducing stressors and providing magnesium (a cofactor for COMT) helps manage the physiological load without overstimulating the system."

                "Approximately 40%",
                "Over 80%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NIH and CDC data suggest that over 80% of microbial infections in the body involve biofilms, which require specific 'quorum sensing' disruptors and enzymatic support to penetrate."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian Theory posits that repeated activation of synaptic pathways increases their strength, providing the biological basis for habit formation and behavioral change in coaching."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, when a client experiences 'Neuroception' of extreme danger and enters a 'Dorsal Vagal' state, they are most likely to exhibit:",
            "options": [
                "Fight or flight behavior and increased heart rate.",
                "Social engagement, eye contact, and calm breathing.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal pathway is the primitive 'freeze' response characterized by immobilization and metabolic conservation when the nervous system perceives a life threat."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrative Business Ethics dictate that any 'Red Flag' symptom must be referred out immediately to ensure client safety and stay within the coaching scope of practice."

                "Only 5% of chronic disease is attributable to lifestyle.",
                "70-90% of chronic disease risk is driven by the 'Exposome' and lifestyle choices.",
                "Genetics and environment contribute exactly 50/50 to all health outcomes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current research indicates that the vast majority (70-90%) of chronic disease risk is determined by environmental exposures and lifestyle (the exposome), rather than fixed genetic sequences."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bottom-up interventions focus on the body first. Breathwork, specifically extended exhalations, directly signals the parasympathetic nervous system via the Vagus nerve to lower sympathetic arousal."
