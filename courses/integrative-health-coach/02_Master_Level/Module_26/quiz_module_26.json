            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'O' in the W.H.O.L.E. framework stands for Optimization of Environment, focusing on how external factors like light, toxins, and social circles influence biological health."

            "question": "According to the Advanced Wellness Assessment protocols, a client presenting with a waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) of 0.62 should be stratified into which risk category?",
            "options": [

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A WHtR over 0.5 is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk; 0.62 places the client in the moderate risk category, requiring specific lifestyle interventions and monitoring."

                "To allow the client time to buy new gym equipment"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sequencing interventions by starting with regulation ensures the client is not in a chronic sympathetic state, which improves adherence and metabolic response to later, more demanding interventions."

                "It guarantees a 100% cure rate for chronic diseases",
                "It is a legal requirement for all health coaches in the United States"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SOPs reduce clinical drift—the tendency for practitioners to deviate from evidence-based protocols over time—thereby maintaining the integrity and efficacy of the program."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule in hybrid modeling allows the curriculum to handle the heavy lifting of education (asynchronous) while the coach focuses high-value time on personalized support (synchronous)."
