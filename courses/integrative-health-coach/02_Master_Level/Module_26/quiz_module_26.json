            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A WHtR over 0.5 is associated with increased health risks; a ratio of 0.6 or higher is generally categorized as high risk for conditions like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, necessitating medical clearance before high-intensity interventions."
