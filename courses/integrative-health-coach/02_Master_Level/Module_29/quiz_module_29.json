            "question": "In the Advanced Synthesis of the W.H.O.L.E. Health Method™, what is defined as the 'Master Lever'?",
            "options": [
                "The primary pharmaceutical intervention prescribed by the physician",
                "The single physiological or psychological node that, when shifted, creates a positive cascade across all other systems",
                "The client's highest-ranking goal in their initial intake form",
                "The dietary protocol that yields the fastest weight loss results"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Master Lever' is the central concept in L1, referring to the strategic identification of the one intervention point (e.g., circadian rhythm or gut permeability) that addresses the root cause of multiple symptoms simultaneously."

        {
            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "According to the Neuro-Endocrine-Immune (NEI) Axis framework, how does chronic HPA-axis activation typically influence immune function?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a permanent increase in Natural Killer (NK) cell activity",
                "It promotes a 'Th1 shift,' leading to acute inflammatory responses",
                "It induces a 'Th2 shift,' potentially suppressing cell-mediated immunity while increasing allergic/autoimmune reactivity",
                "It has no measurable effect on the immune system's cytokine production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L2, chronic cortisol elevation leads to a Th2 shift, which suppresses the Th1 (cell-mediated) response, making the client more susceptible to viral infections while potentially exacerbating allergic or auto-antibody responses."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "When applying Strategic Multi-Modality Layering (L3), why is 'Biological Foundation' addressed before 'Advanced Biohacking'?",
            "options": [
                "To ensure the client spends less money on supplements initially",
                "Because advanced biohacks are ineffective without cellular receptivity and stable glycemic control",
                "Because insurance providers require foundational work first",
                "To build the coach's credibility through slow progress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Layering logic dictates that high-level interventions (like exogenous ketones or peptides) are less effective if the underlying cellular environment is inflamed or if the circadian rhythm is dysregulated."

        {
            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "In the context of Managing Multi-Morbidity (L4), a 2021 study found that patients with 3+ chronic conditions have a significantly higher 'Allostatic Load.' What is the primary risk of addressing all conditions simultaneously?",
            "options": [
                "Increased healthcare costs for the practitioner",
                "Exceeding the client's 'Adaptive Capacity,' leading to a healing crisis or total non-adherence",
                "Violating the terms of the W.H.O.L.E. Health Method™",
                "Rapid detoxification that the liver cannot process"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L4 emphasizes that clients with complex multi-morbidity have low resilience. Overwhelming them with too many changes at once exceeds their 'Adaptive Capacity,' often resulting in a flare-up of symptoms or psychological burnout."

        {
            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "Which epigenetic mechanism, discussed in Lesson 5, involves the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base to typically 'silence' a gene?",
            "options": [
                "Histone Acetylation",
                "DNA Methylation",
                "RNA Interference",
                "Chromatin Remodeling"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DNA Methylation is the most studied epigenetic mechanism where methyl groups are added to DNA, often acting to turn 'off' specific genes, such as tumor suppressor genes or inflammatory cytokines."

        {
            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 explores the 'Psychology of Sustained Self-Healing.' According to the data presented, what percentage of healing outcomes can be attributed to the 'Meaning Response' (the client's belief in the intervention)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5-10%",
                "Between 30% and 50% in many clinical scenarios",
                "Exactly 75% regardless of the condition",
                "Belief has no statistical impact on physiological markers like CRP"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into the placebo and meaning response (L6) suggests that the psychological context and client belief account for 30-50% of the therapeutic outcome, highlighting the importance of the coach-client relationship."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "In Interdisciplinary Leadership (L7), what is the most effective way for a coach to communicate with a client's Medical Doctor?",
            "options": [
                "By providing a list of new diagnoses the coach has identified",
                "By sending a concise 'SBAR' (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) report focused on lifestyle adherence",
                "By telling the client to ignore the doctor's advice on medication",
                "By requesting the doctor hand over full management of the case to the coach"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L7 teaches that using professional communication frameworks like SBAR ensures that the coach stays within their scope of practice while providing valuable, data-driven insights to the medical team."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "During Master Case Conceptualization (L8), the 'Triangulation of Data' involves which three elements?",
            "options": [
                "Blood work, Genetic testing, and Gut microbiome results",
                "Client Subjective Experience, Objective Biomarkers, and Clinical Observations/History",
                "Weight, BMI, and Body Fat Percentage",
                "Dietary logs, Exercise logs, and Sleep logs"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Expert conceptualization (L8) requires looking at the intersection of how the client feels (subjective), what the labs show (objective), and the patterns observed in their history to find the root cause."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "Case Study: 'James' presents with Type 2 Diabetes, Chronic Fatigue, and Mold Toxicity. Using the 'Sequence of Vitality,' which intervention should be prioritized first?",
            "options": [
                "Aggressive mold detoxification using binders and antifungals",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve insulin sensitivity",
                "Stabilizing the NEI axis through sleep hygiene and foundational mineral balance",
                "Prescribing a zero-carb ketogenic diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Per L3 and L4, attempting to detoxify a client (James) who is fatigued and metabolically unstable often backfires. Stabilizing the 'Biological Foundation' (NEI axis/minerals) ensures the body has the energy to handle later detoxification."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "A meta-analysis cited in Module 29 regarding 'Integrative Collaborative Care' showed that this model reduces hospital readmission rates for complex patients by what percentage?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 12%",
                "Approximately 25-31%",
                "Over 85%",
                "It actually increased readmissions due to too many interventions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that interdisciplinary, integrative care models (L7) result in a 25-31% reduction in readmissions by addressing the lifestyle and environmental factors that standard acute care often misses."
