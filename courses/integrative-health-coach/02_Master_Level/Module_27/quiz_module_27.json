            "question": "According to the principles of Integrative Autoimmunity (L1), what percentage of the human immune system is estimated to reside within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": ["20-30%", "50-60%", "70-80%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70-80% of the immune system is located in the gut, making gastrointestinal health the primary focus for managing systemic inflammation and autoimmune triggers."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score of 3.5. Based on Module 27, L2, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": ["Optimal insulin sensitivity", "Early stage insulin resistance", "Significant insulin resistance", "Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance and a higher risk for metabolic syndrome."
        },

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Metabolic Mastery' (L2), which dietary sequencing strategy is most effective for reducing postprandial glucose spikes by up to 73%?",
            "options": ["Carbohydrates first, then protein and fiber", "Fiber first, followed by protein/fats, then carbohydrates", "Fats first, followed by carbohydrates and fiber", "Mixing all macronutrients simultaneously"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consuming fiber (veggies) first, followed by proteins and fats, and leaving starches/sugars for the end of the meal significantly slows gastric emptying and reduces the glucose response."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Which longevity-focused mechanism involves the 'self-eating' process where cells degrade damaged components to optimize cellular health and healthspan?",
            "options": ["Apoptosis", "Autophagy", "Glycation", "Methylation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autophagy is the cellular 'recycling' program stimulated by fasting and exercise that removes dysfunctional proteins and organelles, a key focus of integrative longevity."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In Hormonal Harmony (L4), what is the primary underlying driver of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) symptoms in approximately 70-80% of diagnosed women?",
            "options": ["Progesterone deficiency", "Hyperthyroidism", "Insulin resistance", "Low cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin resistance is the primary driver for most PCOS cases, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia which triggers the ovaries to produce excess androgens."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "The 'Vagus Nerve' serves as the primary bidirectional superhighway for which integrative health concept discussed in L5?",
            "options": ["The HPA Axis", "The Gut-Brain Axis", "The Renin-Angiotensin System", "The Circadian Rhythm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve is the main component of the Gut-Brain Axis, facilitating 80-90% of afferent (gut-to-brain) signaling regarding inflammation and microbiome status."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "According to Integrative Oncology research (L6), consistent moderate physical activity (150+ minutes per week) can reduce the risk of cancer recurrence by approximately what percentage?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "30-50%", "75-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses indicate that regular exercise can reduce the risk of recurrence and cancer-specific mortality by 30-50% for several common cancers, including breast and colon cancer."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Pediatric Integrative Health (L7), the 'First 1000 Days' refers to the critical window for microbiome and immune priming. When does this window begin?",
            "options": ["At birth", "At conception", "At six months of age", "At the start of toddlerhood"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'First 1000 Days' encompasses the period from conception through the child's second birthday, representing a vital window for metabolic and immune programming."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "For High-Performance Coaching (L8), which biomarker is considered the gold standard for measuring Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) balance and recovery status in athletes and executives?",
            "options": ["Resting Glucose", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "Serum Ferritin", "Total Cholesterol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats and is the most sensitive non-invasive metric for assessing the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "An executive client is experiencing 'brain fog' and high stress. Using the biohacking principles from L8, which 'Quick Win' intervention targets the CO2 tolerance to immediately downregulate the sympathetic nervous system?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training", "Exogenous ketones", "Box Breathing (4-4-4-4 technique)", "Blue light exposure"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Box Breathing is a tactical breathing technique used to increase CO2 tolerance and stimulate the vagus nerve, providing an immediate shift from a 'fight or flight' state to a 'rest and digest' state."
