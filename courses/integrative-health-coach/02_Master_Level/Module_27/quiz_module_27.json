            "question": "In the context of autoimmune conditions, what is the primary mechanism of 'Molecular Mimicry'?",
            "options": [
                "The immune system attacks host tissues because their amino acid sequences resemble those of a foreign pathogen.",
                "The gut lining becomes permeable, allowing undigested proteins to enter the bloodstream.",
                "Chronic stress causes the overproduction of cortisol, which suppresses T-cell function.",
                "The body produces too many antibodies in response to environmental toxins like heavy metals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system confuses a foreign antigen with a self-antigen due to structural similarities, a key driver in conditions like Hashimoto's and Rheumatic fever."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) promotes growth and protein synthesis; however, its inhibition (via fasting or caloric restriction) is necessary to trigger autophagy and cellular repair."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High levels of insulin stimulate the ovaries to produce androgens and decrease Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), worsening the hormonal imbalance in PCOS."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Which Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) is most critical for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in the gut-brain axis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a primary energy source for colonocytes and plays a vital role in signaling pathways that strengthen the blood-brain barrier and reduce neuroinflammation."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "When supporting a client undergoing active chemotherapy, why do integrative practitioners often recommend avoiding high-dose supplemental antioxidants (like Vitamin E or C) on treatment days?",
            "options": [
                "They increase the toxicity of the chemotherapy drugs to the liver.",
                "They may neutralize the oxidative stress that chemotherapy uses to kill cancer cells.",
                "They cause rapid excretion of the chemotherapy through the kidneys.",
                "They interfere with the client's appetite and caloric intake."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Many chemotherapy agents work by creating oxidative damage to cancer cells; supplemental antioxidants can potentially protect the tumor cells from the intended therapeutic effect."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates a flexible autonomic nervous system with strong vagal tone, meaning the individual has recovered well and is ready for high-intensity performance."
