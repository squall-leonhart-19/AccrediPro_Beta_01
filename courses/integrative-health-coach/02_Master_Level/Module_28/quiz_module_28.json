            "question": "In Lesson 1, how is a 'Crisis' clinically distinguished from a 'Complex Case' in an integrative health setting?",
            "options": [
                "A crisis is defined by the number of comorbidities, while complexity is defined by the severity of a single symptom.",
                "A crisis is an acute disruption of homeostasis where current coping mechanisms fail, whereas complexity involves multiple interacting chronic conditions.",
                "Complexity requires immediate emergency intervention, while a crisis can be managed over several months of coaching.",
                "There is no clinical distinction; the terms are used interchangeably in integrative health."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A crisis is an acute, time-limited state where an individual's usual problem-solving methods are inadequate, whereas complexity refers to the 'multimorbidity' of interacting biological, psychological, and social factors."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "According to the RAPID model of Psychological First Aid (PFA) discussed in Lesson 2, what is the primary goal of the 'Stabilization' phase?",
            "options": [
                "To provide long-term psychotherapy for underlying personality disorders.",
                "To diagnose the client with a specific DSM-5 category.",
                "To transition the client from a state of acute sympathetic arousal to a more regulated parasympathetic state.",
                "To confront the client about the irrationality of their fears."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stabilization in PFA focuses on immediate physiological and emotional regulation, moving the client out of a 'fight-flight-freeze' state so they can begin to process information and access resources."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis cited in Lesson 3 suggests that approximately what percentage of adults globally live with multimorbidity (two or more chronic conditions)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10-15%",
                "Approximately 33% (1 in 3)",
                "Approximately 60% (3 in 5)",
                "Approximately 85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that roughly one-third of adults globally suffer from multimorbidity, which significantly increases the risk of treatment resistance and requires a more sophisticated coaching approach."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 discusses 'Central Sensitization' in chronic pain. Which mechanism best describes this neuro-inflammatory complexity?",
            "options": [
                "The repair of peripheral nerve endings after an acute injury.",
                "A decrease in the number of pain receptors in the skin.",
                "The 'wind-up' phenomenon where the Central Nervous System remains in a state of high reactivity, amplifying non-painful stimuli.",
                "The immediate cessation of pain signals once a tissue has healed."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Central Sensitization is a condition where the nervous system goes through a process called 'wind-up,' becoming regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity, which lowers the threshold for what the brain perceives as pain."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In trauma-informed coaching (Lesson 5), what is the primary reason coaches are advised to 'Resist Re-traumatization'?",
            "options": [
                "Because coaches are not legally allowed to talk about the past.",
                "Because forcing a client to recount traumatic details can trigger a flood of stress hormones and reinforce maladaptive neural pathways.",
                "Because trauma is usually irrelevant to physical health outcomes.",
                "Because clients often lie about their traumatic histories to gain attention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety; asking a client to 'tell their story' without clinical stabilization can trigger a traumatic stress response, which is counterproductive to the coaching process."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the ICD-11 criteria mentioned in Lesson 6, at what point does 'Normal Grief' potentially transition into the clinical diagnosis of 'Prolonged Grief Disorder'?",
            "options": [
                "When grief lasts longer than two weeks.",
                "When grief persists for at least 6 months and causes significant impairment in functioning.",
                "Only if the client experiences suicidal ideation.",
                "Grief is never considered a disorder regardless of duration."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ICD-11 defines Prolonged Grief Disorder as a persistent and pervasive grief response that continues for at least 6 months following the loss, exceeding social or cultural norms."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Elena' (Lesson 7), which 'Red Flag' necessitated an immediate referral to a mental health professional?",
            "options": [
                "She expressed frustration with her weight loss progress.",
                "She reported sleeping 6 hours a night instead of 8.",
                "She disclosed active suicidal ideation with a specific plan and means.",
                "She decided to switch to a vegan diet without consulting the coach."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active suicidal ideation with a plan and means is a critical 'Red Flag' that falls outside the scope of health coaching and requires an immediate emergency referral."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of a 'Warm Handoff' in interdisciplinary case management (Lesson 8)?",
            "options": [
                "It allows the coach to stop working with the client immediately.",
                "It reduces 'referral leakage' and increases the likelihood the client will follow through with the new provider by establishing trust.",
                "It is a billing technique used to charge the client twice.",
                "It ensures the coach remains the only person the client talks to."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A warm handoff involves the coach directly introducing the client to the new provider, which significantly increases the 'connection rate' and reduces the anxiety associated with seeking new levels of care."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "When dealing with 'Treatment Resistance' in Lesson 3, which strategy is recommended for managing a client with 'Polypharmacy' concerns?",
            "options": [
                "Advise the client to stop all medications and try herbal supplements instead.",
                "Ignore the medications and focus only on exercise.",
                "Collaborate with the client’s pharmacist or physician to understand potential nutrient depletions caused by the medications.",
                "Tell the client that their medications are the sole reason they aren't getting better."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must work within their scope by collaborating with the medical team. Understanding drug-nutrient depletions (e.g., CoQ10 depletion from statins) is a key integrative approach to complex cases."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Lesson 5 mentions the 'Window of Tolerance.' What happens when a client becomes 'Hypo-aroused'?",
            "options": [
                "They become angry, aggressive, and hyper-vigilant.",
                "They experience a 'shutdown' response characterized by numbness, dissociation, or low energy.",
                "They become highly motivated and complete all their goals early.",
                "They experience a state of perfect emotional balance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypo-arousal is the lower boundary of the Window of Tolerance, where the nervous system 'shuts down' as a defense mechanism, leading to emotional numbness or dissociation."
