            "question": "In the context of Integrative Health, how is a 'Crisis' fundamentally distinguished from 'Complexity'?",
            "options": [
                "Crisis refers to the number of co-occurring diagnoses, while complexity refers to the severity of one condition.",
                "Crisis is characterized by an acute, time-limited disruption of homeostasis requiring immediate stabilization, whereas complexity involves multifaceted, interacting chronic variables.",
                "Complexity is a legal term involving malpractice, while crisis is a clinical term for mental health breaks.",
                "There is no functional difference; both require immediate referral to an emergency department."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A crisis is an acute disruption of steady-state (homeostasis) that exceeds a client's current coping mechanisms, while complexity refers to the structural nature of a case (e.g., multimorbidity, socioeconomic factors, and treatment resistance)."

            "options": [
                "To diagnose the client with a specific DSM-V disorder.",
                "To determine which client needs immediate intervention based on functional impairment rather than just emotional distress.",
                "To provide long-term psychotherapy for childhood trauma.",
                "To categorize the client's nutritional deficiencies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In PFA, prioritization (the 'P' in RAPID) involves triaging survivors based on the severity of their functional impairment to ensure those with the greatest need receive help first."

            "question": "A 2021 meta-analysis on multimorbidity (the presence of 2+ chronic conditions) suggests that what percentage of primary care consultations involve complex, multi-morbid patients?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 15%",
                "Approximately 30%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that over 60% of primary care time is spent managing patients with multimorbidity, highlighting the necessity for coaches to understand complex case management."

            "options": [
                "A localized inflammatory response in a single joint.",
                "The peripheral nerves becoming less sensitive to pain over time.",
                "An amplification of neural signaling within the central nervous system that results in hypersensitivity to both noxious and non-noxious stimuli.",
                "The complete cessation of neurotransmitter production in the prefrontal cortex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Central Sensitization involves neuroplastic changes where the CNS enters a state of high reactivity, lowering the pain threshold and maintaining chronic pain even after tissues have healed."

                "Remaining in the 'loss-orientation' phase until all emotional pain is resolved."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model emphasizes that healthy grieving is a dynamic process of oscillation between processing the loss and attending to the practicalities of a changed life."

                "Maintain absolute confidentiality to protect the coaching relationship.",
                "Wait until the next scheduled session to see if the feeling persists.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical and legal standards (like the Tarasoff ruling) mandate that the 'protective privilege ends where the public peril begins,' requiring a breach of confidentiality in cases of specific, credible threats to others."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A warm handoff is a near-seamless transfer of care where the current provider introduces the client to the new provider, reducing the 'referral gap' and increasing client engagement."

            "options": [
                "Her conditions share the same pathogenetic pathway and treatment goals.",
                "Her conditions (e.g., PTSD and Diabetes) represent different therapeutic challenges that may require conflicting management strategies.",
                "She only has one 'real' illness, and the others are psychosomatic.",
                "She is resistant to all forms of integrative intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Discordant conditions are those that are not clinically related and may have competing demands, making management significantly more complex than concordant conditions (like Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sudden, severe headaches (potential hemorrhage) and significant unexplained weight loss (potential malignancy) are clinical red flags that fall outside the coaching scope and require immediate medical evaluation."
