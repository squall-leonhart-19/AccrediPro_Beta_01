        {
            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which component of the immune system provides the 'first line of defense' through non-specific mechanisms like physical barriers and phagocytosis, typically responding within minutes to hours?",
            "options": [
                "The Adaptive Immune System",
                "The Innate Immune System",
                "Humoral Immunity",
                "Cell-Mediated Memory"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The innate immune system is the body's immediate, non-specific response to pathogens, utilizing physical barriers (skin), chemical barriers, and cells like macrophages and neutrophils."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Three-Legged Stool' model of autoimmunity proposed by Dr. Alessio Fasano, which three factors must be present for an autoimmune condition to manifest?",
            "options": [
                "High sugar intake, sedentary lifestyle, and chronic stress",
                "Genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger, and intestinal permeability",
                "Vitamin D deficiency, viral load, and heavy metal toxicity",
                "Antibiotic overuse, lack of sleep, and poor methylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Fasano's research suggests that autoimmunity requires a genetic susceptibility, exposure to an environmental trigger (like gluten or a virus), and a 'leaky' gut (intestinal permeability) that allows triggers to interact with the immune system."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Which protein is responsible for modulating the permeability of tight junctions in the digestive tract, and is often found at elevated levels in patients with Celiac disease and Type 1 Diabetes?",
            "options": [
                "Occludin",
                "Zonulin",
                "Calprotectin",
                "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; when overproduced, it leads to the 'opening' of the gut barrier, a hallmark of autoimmune pathogenesis."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In the context of 'Molecular Mimicry,' how does a chronic infection like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) potentially trigger an autoimmune response?",
            "options": [
                "The virus directly eats the host's healthy tissue cells",
                "The virus shuts down the production of all T-cells",
                "Immune cells confuse viral proteins with the body's own similar-looking proteins",
                "The virus creates a physical shield that prevents antibodies from working"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry occurs when the immune system targets a pathogen's amino acid sequences that happen to resemble the host's own tissues, leading to 'friendly fire' against organs like the thyroid or myelin sheath."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue and joint pain. Their labs show a Vitamin D level of 22 ng/mL. Based on integrative health standards for immune optimization, what is the target range for Vitamin D (25-OH)?",
            "options": [
                "20–30 ng/mL",

                "Over 150 ng/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 30 ng/mL is often considered the 'floor' for conventional medicine, integrative practitioners typically aim for 50–80 ng/mL to support optimal immune modulation and T-regulatory cell function."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the human immune system is located within the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Between 70% and 80% of the immune system resides in the gut, making the microbiome and intestinal barrier the primary interface for immune education and defense."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), chronic stress leads to 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Resistance.' What is the clinical result of this phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "The immune system becomes hyper-responsive to cortisol, stopping all inflammation",
                "Immune cells lose sensitivity to cortisol's 'off switch,' leading to runaway inflammation",
                "The body stops producing adrenaline entirely",
                "The thymus gland grows in size to compensate for stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress causes immune cells to downregulate their receptors for cortisol. Because cortisol's role is to suppress inflammation, this resistance means the immune system continues to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines unchecked."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which specific type of T-cell acts as the 'peacekeeper' of the immune system, preventing the overactivation that leads to autoimmunity?",

                "Th17 cells",
                "Cytotoxic T-cells",

                "Natural Killer (NK) cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T-Regulatory (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining self-tolerance; they suppress the activity of other effector T-cells once a threat has passed or when they target self-tissues."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "ASIIA (Autoimmune/inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants) refers to immune dysfunction caused by which of the following environmental factors?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive intake of refined sugar",
                "Substances like silicone, aluminum, or certain chemicals that hyper-stimulate the immune response",
                "Lack of exposure to sunlight during winter months",
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed daily"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adjuvants are substances that enhance the immune response to an antigen. ASIIA syndrome describes how chronic exposure to environmental adjuvants (like heavy metals or implants) can trigger systemic autoimmunity in susceptible individuals."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis reports that their symptoms flare significantly after eating gluten, even though they do not have Celiac disease. This is most likely due to:",
            "options": [
                "A psychological placebo effect",
                "The high calorie content of gluten-containing grains",
                "Cross-reactivity, where gluten antibodies attack thyroid tissue due to structural similarities",
                "The fact that gluten contains high levels of thyroid hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Hashimoto's, the protein structure of gluten (gliadin) closely resembles the molecular structure of the thyroid gland. This cross-reactivity means gluten consumption can trigger an immune attack on the thyroid."
