            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "The 'Total Toxic Burden' refers to the cumulative effect of the human exposome. According to the module, which factor contributes most significantly to the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs)?",
            "options": [
                "Acute high-dose exposure over a 24-hour period",
                "Lipophilic storage in adipose tissue and low-level chronic exposure",
                "Immediate excretion via the renal system",
                "The upregulation of Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic, meaning they are stored in fat cells (adipose tissue). Their long half-lives and chronic, low-level exposure lead to a significant increase in the total toxic burden over time."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In Advanced Phase II Liver Detoxification, which pathway is specifically responsible for the conjugation of 40-70% of all clinical drugs, including acetaminophen and many steroid hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Methylation",
                "Acetylation",
                "Glucuronidation",
                "Amino Acid Conjugation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is the most common Phase II pathway, utilizing glucuronic acid to make toxins water-soluble for excretion. It handles a vast majority of pharmaceuticals and endogenous hormones."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "The Glymphatic System is a macroscopic waste clearance system for the CNS. During which physiological state does the interstitial space increase by up to 60%, allowing for the clearance of Beta-amyloid?",
            "options": [
                "During high-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "During the post-prandial (after eating) state",

                "During periods of acute psychological stress"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research shows the glymphatic system is primarily active during sleep, specifically slow-wave sleep, where the expansion of the interstitial space facilitates the 'flushing' of metabolic waste by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like phthalates and BPA are classified as 'obesogens.' What is the primary biochemical mechanism by which they promote weight gain?",
            "options": [
                "By destroying the thyroid gland's ability to produce T4",
                "By activating PPAR-gamma receptors and stimulating adipogenesis (fat cell creation)",
                "By inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine",
                "By increasing the metabolic rate beyond the body's capacity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs act as obesogens by activating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which triggers the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes and increases fat storage."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Mitochondrial optimization is central to cellular longevity. Which co-substrate is essential for Sirtuin (SIRT1) activity, acting as a 'fuel' for DNA repair and metabolic regulation?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium Malate",
                "NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)",
                "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)",
                "Glutathione"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. Without sufficient NAD+ levels, which naturally decline with age, SIRT1 cannot perform its functions in DNA repair and mitochondrial biogenesis."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Lead (Pb) bioaccumulation is particularly dangerous because it mimics which essential mineral, allowing it to be sequestered in the skeletal system for decades?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lead mimics calcium and is stored in the bone matrix. During periods of high bone turnover (like pregnancy or menopause), this sequestered lead can be released back into the bloodstream."

                "The Glymphatic system is over-clearing toxins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'pathological detoxifier' has an overactive Phase I (producing reactive intermediate metabolites) that exceeds the capacity of a sluggish Phase II, leading to the buildup of highly toxic intermediates."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary epigenetic mechanism by which the environment influences longevity, as measured by the 'Horvath Clock'?",
            "options": [

                "Blood glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Horvath Clock (epigenetic clock) measures biological age by looking at DNA methylation patterns—chemical tags that turn genes on or off without changing the underlying DNA sequence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While HEPA filters trap particles, activated carbon is required to adsorb gases and VOCs. This is the most effective way to reduce chemical pollutants in indoor air."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mercury has a high affinity for thiol (sulfhydryl) groups. By binding to these, it inactivates critical enzymes and depletes glutathione, the body's master antioxidant."
