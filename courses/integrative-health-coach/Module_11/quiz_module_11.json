            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "The concept of the 'Human Exposome' is best defined as:",
            "options": [
                "The set of genes an individual is born with that determines detox capacity.",
                "The measure of all exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health.",
                "The specific list of heavy metals found in a client's blood panel.",
                "The rate at which the liver processes Phase I metabolites."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The exposome represents the totality of environmental exposures (diet, lifestyle, pollutants) from conception onwards, complementing the genome by providing a holistic view of environmental impact on health."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In Advanced Liver Biochemistry, what is the primary risk of 'Pathological Detoxification,' where Phase I activity far exceeds Phase II capacity?",
            "options": [
                "The client will excrete toxins too quickly, leading to nutrient depletion.",
                "The liver will stop producing bile entirely.",
                "The accumulation of highly reactive, toxic intermediate metabolites that cause DNA and cellular damage.",
                "A significant increase in the production of NAD+."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I creates reactive intermediates that are often more toxic than the original substance. If Phase II (conjugation) is sluggish, these intermediates can cause significant oxidative stress and tissue damage."

        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to research on the Glymphatic System, by what percentage does the brain's interstitial space increase during deep sleep to facilitate waste clearance?",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "25%",
                "60%",
                "95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (notably Xie et al., 2013) demonstrate that the interstitial space increases by 60% during sleep, allowing Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) to flush out metabolic waste like amyloid-beta."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) like phthalates and BPA are particularly dangerous because they can exert effects at:",
            "options": [
                "Only extremely high, industrial-level doses.",
                "Extremely low doses (parts per billion) by mimicking or blocking natural hormones.",
                "Only when ingested orally, but not through skin contact.",
                "The moment of excretion rather than the moment of exposure."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs follow a non-monotonic dose-response curve, meaning they can interfere with delicate hormonal signaling at incredibly low concentrations, often mimicking estrogen or blocking androgen receptors."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which molecule is considered the 'master regulator' of mitochondrial biogenesis, stimulated by stressors like exercise and cold thermogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "PGC-1α",
                "mTOR",
                "Insulin",
                "Homocysteine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) is the central inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis, helping the body create new, more efficient mitochondria."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Lead (Pb) is known to have a biological half-life in the bones of up to 20-30 years because it chemically mimics which essential mineral?",
            "options": [
                "Zinc",
                "Iron",
                "Calcium",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lead mimics calcium. Because of this, the body mistakenly sequesters lead into the bone matrix, where it can remain for decades and be released during periods of bone resorption (like menopause or pregnancy)."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of proteins that support longevity. Which cofactor is absolutely required for Sirtuin activity?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "NAD+",
                "Magnesium",
                "Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent deacetylases. As NAD+ levels decline with age, Sirtuin activity decreases, which is why NAD+ precursors are a major focus in longevity science."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "When designing a Clean Living Roadmap for a client, why is high-quality water filtration usually the first priority?",
            "options": [
                "It is the most expensive intervention and should be handled first.",
                "Water is the largest volume substance humans consume, and it often contains chlorine, fluoride, and 'forever chemicals' (PFAS).",
                "Water filtration automatically balances the body's pH.",
                "Filtered water eliminates the need for Phase II liver detoxification."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to the sheer volume of water consumed daily for drinking, cooking, and bathing, it represents the most consistent source of potential toxin exposure, making its filtration a high-leverage 'win' for the client."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which Phase II conjugation pathway is specifically dependent on the availability of sulfur-containing amino acids like cysteine and methionine?",

                "Glucuronidation",
                "Sulfation",
                "Methylation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sulfation pathway requires sulfate groups derived from sulfur-containing amino acids. It is critical for detoxifying steroid hormones, neurotransmitters, and certain drugs."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "Which cellular process is inhibited by high insulin and mTOR signaling but is essential for 'cellular housekeeping' and the removal of damaged proteins?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autophagy (self-eating) is the body's mechanism for recycling damaged organelles. It is activated by AMPK (during fasting/exercise) and inhibited by mTOR (during constant feeding/high protein/high carb intake)."
