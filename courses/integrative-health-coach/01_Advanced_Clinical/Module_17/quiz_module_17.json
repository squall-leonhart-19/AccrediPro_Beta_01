            "question": "In the 'Lead Domino' framework for multi-system dysfunction (L1), which system is most frequently addressed first to resolve systemic downstream effects?",
            "options": [
                "Cardiovascular output",
                "Gastrointestinal integrity and microbiome balance",
                "Musculoskeletal strength",
                "Cognitive behavioral patterns"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, the gut is often the 'Lead Domino' because intestinal permeability and dysbiosis drive the systemic inflammation that fuels other dysfunctions."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "During an acute autoimmune flare (L2), what is the most appropriate coaching adjustment according to the 'Pacing Strategy'?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of exercise to 'sweat out' inflammation",
                "Introduce three new dietary supplements to arrest the flare",

                "Maintain the current protocol to ensure consistency despite symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During a flare, the client's 'Window of Tolerance' narrows. Coaching should shift toward down-regulating the sympathetic nervous system and prioritizing recovery."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client on long-term Metformin for Metabolic Syndrome (L3) presents with fatigue and tingling in the extremities. Which nutrient deficiency should the coach flag for clinical review?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates up to 30% of long-term Metformin users experience Vitamin B12 malabsorption, which can lead to fatigue and peripheral neuropathy."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to the NEI Axis model (L4), how does chronic HPA-axis activation (high cortisol) specifically impact the immune system?",
            "options": [
                "It permanently increases Secretory IgA (sIgA) levels",
                "It has no measurable effect on immune markers",
                "It suppresses Secretory IgA (sIgA) and shifts the Th1/Th2 balance",
                "It exclusively strengthens the mucosal barrier"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation suppresses sIgA (the first line of immune defense) and can cause a Th2 shift, increasing susceptibility to infections and allergies."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Studies on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) discussed in L5 show that an ACE score of 4 or higher is associated with which approximate increase in the risk of autoimmune disease?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A landmark study (Dube et al.) found that individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher had a 70% to 100% increased risk of being hospitalized with an autoimmune disease."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When troubleshooting a 'Non-Responder' who has reached a weight loss plateau despite caloric restriction (L6), what 'hidden stressor' should be evaluated first?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)",
                "Insufficient protein intake (below 0.5g/kg)",
                "Circadian disruption and poor sleep hygiene",
                "Inadequate consumption of green tea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Circadian disruption affects leptin/ghrelin balance and insulin sensitivity. In non-responders, fixing sleep often 'unlocks' metabolic progress when diet alone fails."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "The concept of 'Total Toxic Burden' (L7) suggests that bio-individual sensitivity to environmental toxins is primarily determined by:",
            "options": [
                "The client's age and height",
                "The rate of exposure versus the body's biotransformation (detoxification) capacity",
                "The number of indoor plants in the home",
                "The client's blood type"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Total Toxic Burden is the accumulation of toxins relative to the body's ability to process and eliminate them, influenced by genetics (e.g., MTHFR) and organ function."

            "options": [
                "Advise the client to taper off slowly over two weeks",
                "Suggest a natural supplement like hibiscus tea to replace the drug",
                "Facilitate a conversation between the client and their prescribing physician to discuss a supervised reduction",
                "Tell the client that medication is unnecessary if they follow the diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never advise on medication changes. The role is to empower the client to work with their MD to determine if lifestyle improvements warrant a dosage adjustment."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with 'Poly-Pharmacy' (L3) is taking a statin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor. Which 'synergy' risk is most relevant for the coach to monitor regarding lifestyle?",
            "options": [
                "Increased risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance during exercise",
                "Excessive muscle growth from protein intake",
                "Improved caffeine tolerance",
                "Decreased need for Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diuretics and ACE inhibitors both affect fluid/electrolyte balance; statins can cause muscle soreness. The synergy increases the risk of dehydration and rhabdomyolysis during intense heat/exercise."
