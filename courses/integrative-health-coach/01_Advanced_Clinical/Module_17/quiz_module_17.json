            "question": "When working with a 'Multi-System Dysfunction' client, what is the primary purpose of identifying the 'Lead Domino'?",
            "options": [
                "To treat every symptom simultaneously using a broad-spectrum approach",
                "To identify the physiological system that, when addressed, creates the greatest positive downstream effect on other systems",
                "To determine which medical specialist the client should see first",
                "To rank symptoms by their severity according to the client's subjective pain scale"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Lead Domino concept focuses on identifying the root cause or primary system (often GI or HPA axis) that triggers dysregulation in other systems, allowing for more efficient and effective coaching interventions."

            "question": "In the context of Autoimmune Complexity (L2), what is the most effective coaching strategy for a client experiencing the 'Boom-and-Bust' cycle during flares?",

                "Encouraging the client to push through the fatigue to maintain consistency",
                "Implementing 'Pacing' strategies to keep activity levels below the threshold of symptom exacerbation",
                "Increasing the intensity of anti-inflammatory supplementation during the 'Bust' phase",
                "Focusing exclusively on dietary triggers while ignoring physical activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pacing is a critical tool for autoimmune clients to avoid the cycle of overexertion during 'good days' which inevitably leads to 'crashes' or flares."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client with Metabolic Syndrome has been taking Metformin for five years and reports new-onset numbness in their feet and brain fog. Based on Lesson 3, which nutrient depletion should be considered?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term Metformin use is clinically associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency, which can manifest as peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment, often mistaken for worsening diabetes or aging."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "The Neuro-Endocrine-Immune (NEI) Axis (L4) explains how 'sickness behavior' is triggered. Which molecules are primarily responsible for crossing the blood-brain barrier to signal the brain to initiate this behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cytokines are the primary signaling molecules of the immune system that communicate with the nervous system to induce 'sickness behavior,' which includes fatigue, anhedonia, and social withdrawal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research (Felitti et al.) shows that an ACE score of 4+ correlates with a 390% increase in the risk of COPD, highlighting the profound link between early trauma and chronic physical illness."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A 'Non-Responder' client (L6) is strictly adhering to a caloric deficit and exercise plan but has seen no change in body composition for 12 weeks. What is the first 'Hidden Variable' a coach should investigate?",
            "options": [
                "The client's lack of willpower",
                "The accuracy of their food scale",

                "The need for a higher intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In non-responders, chronic stress and high cortisol can cause metabolic adaptation and water retention, masking fat loss and stalling progress despite caloric adherence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Bucket' analogy explains that individuals have different capacities for toxins; symptoms appear only when the 'bucket' overflows due to the accumulation of environmental, dietary, and metabolic wastes."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification involves multiple pathways (Sulfation, Glucuronidation, Acetylation, etc.). In complex toxicant cases, these pathways often become sluggish or depleted, leading to systemic sensitivity."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "In the 'NEI Axis' model, chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) typically has what effect on the gut-immune barrier?",

                "It strengthens the tight junctions of the gut lining",
                "It increases the production of Secretory IgA (sIgA)",
                "It increases intestinal permeability ('Leaky Gut') by altering blood flow and mucus production",
                "It has no measurable effect on the gastrointestinal system"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic SNS dominance (stress) diverts blood flow away from the gut and reduces protective mucus and sIgA, leading to increased permeability and immune activation."
