                "A ratio less than 0.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A TG:HDL ratio > 3.0 is a highly specific marker for insulin resistance and is strongly correlated with the presence of small, dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is highlighted as a marker of HPA axis resilience. What does a 'blunted' or flat CAR typically indicate in a clinical setting?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The classic PCOS phenotype is typically characterized by an elevated LH to FSH ratio (often 3:1) and hyperinsulinemia, which drives ovarian androgen production."
