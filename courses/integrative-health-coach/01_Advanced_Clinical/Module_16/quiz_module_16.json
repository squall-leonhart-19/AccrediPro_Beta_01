            "question": "A client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 4.2. Based on the W.H.O.L.E. approach to Metabolic Syndrome, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "The client is metabolically healthy as the score is below 5.0.",
                "The client has optimal insulin sensitivity.",
                "The client demonstrates significant insulin resistance, as a score > 2.9 indicates a high risk of metabolic dysfunction.",
                "The score is irrelevant without a measured HbA1c of at least 6.5%."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In functional medicine and the W.H.O.L.E. approach, a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score greater than 1.9 indicates early resistance, while a score above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance."

            "question": "In the context of Autoimmunity and Gut-Immune Synergy, what is the significance of 'Molecular Mimicry'?",
            "options": [
                "It is the process where the body creates identical copies of beneficial bacteria.",
                "It occurs when the immune system confuses foreign antigens (like gliadin) with self-tissue (like thyroid peroxidase) due to structural similarities.",
                "It is a technique used in labs to grow synthetic probiotics.",
                "It refers to the gut's ability to mimic the brain's neurotransmitter production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry is a primary mechanism in autoimmunity where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues because they structurally resemble environmental triggers, such as food proteins or pathogens."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Cell Danger Response' (CDR) model discussed in mitochondrial health, what happens when a cell perceives a threat?",
            "options": [
                "Mitochondria increase ATP production to fuel the immune response.",
                "Mitochondria shift from energy production to cellular defense, stiffening the cell membrane and altering metabolism.",
                "The cell immediately undergoes apoptosis to protect the organism.",
                "The HPA axis is bypassed to allow for faster local cellular healing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proposed by Dr. Robert Naviaux, the CDR describes how mitochondria shift away from energy metabolism toward cellular defense in response to chemical, physical, or biological threats, which can lead to chronic fatigue if the cycle is not completed."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A 32-year-old female client presents with PCOS, acne, and a LH:FSH ratio of 3:1. Which underlying driver is most likely present?",
            "options": [
                "Progesterone dominance",
                "Adrenal insufficiency",
                "Hyperinsulinemia driving ovarian androgen production",
                "Hypothyroidism caused by iodine excess"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elevated LH:FSH ratio (typically > 2:1) is a classic marker of PCOS. High levels of insulin stimulate the theca cells in the ovaries to produce excess androgens, disrupting the hormonal synergy required for ovulation."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "Regarding the Gut-Brain Axis, what percentage of the Vagus Nerve fibers are 'afferent,' sending signals from the gut to the brain?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 20%",
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 90%",
                "Less than 10%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve is a bidirectional superhighway, but roughly 80-90% of its fibers are afferent, meaning the majority of communication is traveling from the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "Which inflammatory marker is considered a 'gold standard' for assessing cardiovascular resilience and the 'fire' within the arterial walls?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "High-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)",
                "Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)",
                "Alkaline Phosphatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is a critical marker for systemic inflammation. Levels above 3.0 mg/L are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events, regardless of cholesterol levels."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In the 'Detoxification Pathways' lesson, why is it critical to support Phase II conjugation before aggressively stimulating Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I is not necessary for fat-soluble toxins.",
                "Phase II is responsible for making toxins more reactive and dangerous.",
                "If Phase I is faster than Phase II, intermediate metabolites (which are often more toxic) can accumulate and cause tissue damage.",
                "Phase II only handles heavy metals, while Phase I handles pesticides."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I converts toxins into intermediate metabolites that are often more reactive (oxidative). Phase II must be ready to conjugate these intermediates to make them water-soluble for excretion; otherwise, 'pathological detoxification' occurs."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "A client with chronic stress shows a 'flat-line' diurnal cortisol pattern with very low morning levels. This is characteristic of which HPA axis state?",
            "options": [
                "Acute Stress Response (Stage 1)",
                "Resistance Phase (Stage 2)",
                "HPA Axis Dysfunction / Hypocortisolism (Stage 3)",
                "Optimal Adaptive Resilience"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flat-line or low diurnal curve, where the body is no longer able to produce an appropriate cortisol awakening response, is often termed 'Stage 3' or hypocortisolism, indicating long-term HPA axis exhaustion."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "When managing a complex multi-system case involving gut dysbiosis, HPA dysfunction, and estrogen dominance, which is generally the most effective 'Lead Domino' to address first?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training to lower estrogen",
                "Synthetic hormone replacement therapy",
                "Gut health and digestive function to ensure proper nutrient absorption and toxin elimination",
                "Aggressive liver detoxification using herbal chelators"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In integrative health, the gut is often the 'Lead Domino.' Addressing dysbiosis and intestinal permeability first can reduce systemic inflammation, improve nutrient status for the HPA axis, and ensure the estrobolome is properly excreting estrogen."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "According to NHANES data cited in the course, what percentage of the US adult population is considered 'metabolically healthy' based on five key markers (glucose, triglycerides, HDL, blood pressure, and waist circumference)?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 50%",
                "Approximately 33%",

                "Approximately 88%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A significant 2019 study using NHANES data found that only 12.2% of American adults are metabolically healthy, highlighting the critical need for integrative health coaching intervention."
