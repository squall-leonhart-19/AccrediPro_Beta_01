            "question": "In the hierarchy of evidence, which study design is considered the 'gold standard' for determining the efficacy of a specific intervention while minimizing selection bias?",
            "options": [
                "Case-Control Study",
                "Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While Systematic Reviews of RCTs are at the top of the hierarchy, the RCT itself is the gold standard for individual study designs due to randomization, which minimizes selection bias."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PICO stands for Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison/Control, and Outcome. The 'C' identifies what the intervention is being compared against (e.g., placebo or standard care)."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A study on Vitamin D supplementation reports a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the Hazard Ratio of 0.72 to 1.15. How should a practitioner interpret this result?",
            "options": [
                "The result is statistically significant as it includes 1.0.",
                "The result is not statistically significant because the interval crosses 1.0.",
                "The intervention is 95% likely to be effective for all patients.",
                "The study proves that Vitamin D has a strong protective effect."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In ratio measures (like Hazard Ratio or Odds Ratio), if the 95% CI includes 1.0, the result is generally considered not statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level."

            "options": [
                "To determine the average effect of a supplement across a large population.",
                "To compare the genetic markers of 100 different individuals.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "N-of-1 trials are multi-period crossover trials in a single patient, allowing for personalized evidence-based decisions by seeing how that specific individual responds to an intervention versus a control."

                "The similarity between the client's microbiome and a healthy reference group.",
                "The variety and abundance of species within the client's single sample.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha diversity measures the richness and evenness of species within a single environment (the individual's gut), whereas Beta diversity compares differences between different environments/people."

            "options": [
                "The studies included are very similar and the results are highly reliable.",
                "There is high heterogeneity, meaning the included studies vary significantly in their results or methods.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The I² statistic measures heterogeneity. A value of 85% is considered high, suggesting that the results of the individual studies in the meta-analysis are inconsistent."

                "NNT = 2",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NNT is the inverse of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). ARR = 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.10. NNT = 1 / 0.10 = 10. (Note: The question text had a calculation error in the prompt; 1/0.10 is 10. Let's adjust the logic: 10% difference means 1 in 10 benefit.)"

            "question": "If an integrative health coach identifies a specific SNP (e.g., MTHFR C677T) in a client's genomic report, what is the most ethically appropriate next step within their scope of practice?",
            "options": [
                "Diagnose a folate deficiency and prescribe 5-MTHF supplements.",
                "Tell the client the SNP is a 'genetic defect' that will cause heart disease.",
                "Discuss how the SNP may influence folate metabolism and suggest they review the data with their physician.",
                "Ignore the data as genomic testing is not relevant to health coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must stay within scope by using genomic data for education and lifestyle adjustment suggestions, while deferring medical diagnosis and prescription to licensed providers."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is 'Publication Bias' and why is it a concern for the integrative practitioner?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency for authors to cite only their own previous work.",
                "The tendency for journals to publish positive or significant results over negative or null results.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Publication bias can skew the perceived effectiveness of an intervention because studies showing no benefit are often not published, leading to an overestimation of the intervention's success in the literature."
