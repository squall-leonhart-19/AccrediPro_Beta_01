            "options": [
                "Peer-reviewed research, cost-effectiveness, and clinician preference",
                "Best research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values/circumstances",

            "question": "In the Hierarchy of Evidence, why are Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses considered the 'Gold Standard' over individual Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)?",
            "options": [
                "They use larger font sizes and more complex mathematical formulas",
                "They prioritize anecdotal evidence from expert clinicians",
                "They synthesize data from multiple high-quality studies to reduce the impact of individual study bias and increase statistical power",
                "They are cheaper and faster to produce than primary research"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses provide a higher level of evidence because they aggregate data from multiple studies, providing a more precise estimate of the effect size and reducing the risk of error inherent in single studies."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Publication bias occurs when the outcome of an experiment influences the decision whether to publish it, often resulting in only positive results reaching the public."

            "options": [
                "Only 5% of people will benefit from the probiotic",
                "The probiotic must be taken for 5 months to see results",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NNT is the number of patients who need to receive an intervention to prevent one additional bad outcome or achieve one additional good outcome. A lower NNT indicates a more effective intervention."

            "options": [
                "The result is statistically significant because the interval does not cross 1.0",
                "The result is not significant because the interval is too wide",
                "The intervention increased the risk by 25%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In ratio measures (like Relative Risk), if the 95% CI does not include 1.0, the result is considered statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level."

                "It is only used for end-of-life care"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N-of-1 trials are the pinnacle of personalized medicine, using repeated 'on' and 'off' periods of an intervention in a single patient to confirm individual efficacy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha diversity measures the variety of species within a single environment (like one individual's gut). Higher alpha diversity is generally associated with better health outcomes."
