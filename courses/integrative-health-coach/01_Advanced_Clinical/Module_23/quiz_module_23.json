            "question": "When interpreting functional labs, how does the 'Functional Range' for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) typically differ from the standard 'Clinical Range' used by most diagnostic laboratories?",
            "options": [
                "The functional range is wider (0.1–10.0 mIU/L) to account for bio-individuality.",
                "The functional range is narrower (typically 0.5–2.5 mIU/L) to identify subclinical dysfunction before disease onset.",
                "There is no difference; functional ranges are only used for stool and saliva testing.",
                "The functional range only looks at TSH in relation to Reverse T3, ignoring the clinical floor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional medicine practitioners use narrower 'optimal' ranges (e.g., 0.5–2.5 mIU/L for TSH) to identify patterns of dysfunction before a client reaches a state of pathology defined by the broader clinical range (often up to 4.5 or 5.0 mIU/L)."

            "options": [
                "Directly challenge the client's logic to highlight the risks of their behavior.",
                "Provide immediate education on why their current behavior is harmful.",
                "Use a double-sided reflection that acknowledges the sustain talk while highlighting the client's own change talk.",
                "Redirect the conversation to a different topic to avoid conflict."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Double-sided reflections (e.g., 'On one hand, you enjoy the comfort of evening snacks, but on the other hand, you mentioned feeling frustrated that it interferes with your sleep') validate the client's struggle while keeping the focus on their stated goals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T homozygous mutation can reduce the enzyme's efficiency by up to 70%, significantly impacting the production of 5-MTHF, which is critical for homocysteine recycling and DNA methylation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is a major Phase II pathway that utilizes glucuronic acid to make fat-soluble toxins (including many drugs and hormones) water-soluble for excretion via bile or urine."

                "Using high-intensity interval training to 'burn off' stored traumatic energy.",
                "Guiding the client to ignore physical sensations and focus solely on cognitive reframing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of experiencing small amounts of distress at a time, ensuring the client stays within their 'Window of Tolerance' to prevent re-traumatization."

            "options": [
                "Statins increase the absorption of Vitamin A, leading to toxicity.",
                "Statins inhibit the synthesis of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), potentially leading to myalgia and mitochondrial fatigue.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Statins block the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for the production of both cholesterol and CoQ10; depletion of CoQ10 is a common side effect of statin therapy."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, whereas an RER of 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. Metabolic flexibility is the ability to shift between these values based on fuel availability."
