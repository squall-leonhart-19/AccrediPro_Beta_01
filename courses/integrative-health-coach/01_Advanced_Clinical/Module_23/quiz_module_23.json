            "question": "When interpreting functional lab markers, how does a 'functional range' differ from a standard 'clinical laboratory range'?",
            "options": [
                "Functional ranges are wider to account for more diverse populations.",
                "Functional ranges are based on the mean of the 'healthy' 95% of the population, whereas clinical ranges identify pathology.",
                "Functional ranges represent optimal physiological function, while clinical ranges represent the statistical average of the laboratory's specific population, often including sick individuals.",
                "Clinical ranges are determined by the WHO, while functional ranges are determined by insurance companies."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard clinical ranges are typically calculated using a bell curve of the population that visits that specific lab, which often includes individuals with undiagnosed or chronic illness. Functional ranges are narrower and represent the 'sweet spot' for optimal physiological performance and disease prevention."

            "question": "In Advanced Motivational Interviewing, what is the most appropriate coach response when a client demonstrates 'Sustain Talk' regarding their current sedentary lifestyle?",
            "options": [
                "Provide educational materials on the risks of a sedentary lifestyle to increase 'Change Talk'.",
                "Use 'Coming Alongside' by agreeing with the client's reasons for not exercising to decrease resistance.",
                "Directly challenge the client's logic using a pros-and-cons list.",
                "Refer the client to a therapist, as Sustain Talk indicates deep-seated psychological trauma."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coming Alongside is an advanced MI technique where the coach sides with the client's sustain talk. This paradoxically often triggers the client to argue for the change themselves, reducing discord in the coaching relationship."

            "question": "A client with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is struggling with fatigue and brain fog. Based on Nutrigenomics, which intervention is most biologically appropriate?",

                "Total avoidance of all cruciferous vegetables to prevent thyroid suppression."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR C677T mutation reduces the body's ability to convert synthetic folic acid into the active form (5-MTHF). Supplementing with methylfolate and consuming natural food folates bypasses this enzymatic bottleneck."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is a major Phase II pathway that uses glucuronic acid to make fat-soluble toxins, such as BPA, estrogen metabolites, and various medications, water-soluble for excretion."

                "The physiological measurement of cortisol levels throughout a coaching session."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration is the process of experiencing small amounts of distress at a time. This ensures the client stays within their 'Window of Tolerance' rather than becoming overwhelmed or shut down (dissociated)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway, which is required for the synthesis of both cholesterol and CoQ10. This depletion is a common cause of statin-induced myopathy (muscle pain)."

            "question": "A client presents with a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.95 during a fasted morning assessment. What does this most likely indicate regarding their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "They are primarily burning fat and are metabolically flexible.",
                "They are in a state of deep ketosis.",
                "They are primarily burning carbohydrates even in a fasted state, indicating metabolic inflexibility.",
                "Their mitochondria are over-producing ATP, leading to oxidative stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A fasted RER of 0.95 is high, suggesting the client cannot efficiently switch to fat-burning (metabolic inflexibility)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hyper-arousal is characterized by the sympathetic nervous system being stuck in 'on' (fight/flight), whereas hypo-arousal (the bottom of the window) is characterized by the dorsal vagal 'shut down' or freeze response."
