            "question": "In the W.H.O.L.E. Timeline methodology, which category specifically addresses the 'Antecedents'—the underlying genetic predispositions and pre-birth factors that set the stage for a client's health status?",
            "options": [
                "The 'W' (Wellness Baseline)",
                "The 'H' (History & Origins)",
                "The 'O' (Objectives)",
                "The 'E' (Environmental Inputs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'H' (History & Origins) in the W.H.O.L.E. timeline is designed to capture antecedents, including family history, birth method (C-section vs. vaginal), and early childhood illnesses that precede the onset of chronic symptoms."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When analyzing Functional Blood Chemistry, a 'Functional Range' for Ferritin is typically considered 40–100 ng/mL. If a client presents with a Ferritin level of 22 ng/mL, how should an Integrative Health Coach interpret this according to the course methodology?",
            "options": [
                "The client is within the 'Normal' lab range and requires no intervention.",
                "The client is in a state of clinical anemia and requires immediate medical referral.",
                "The client is in a 'Functional Deficiency' state, potentially impacting mitochondrial function and energy despite being within standard lab ranges.",
                "The client has iron overload and should avoid red meat."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges are narrower than pathological lab ranges. A ferritin of 22 ng/mL is often 'normal' on standard labs (which may go as low as 12-15), but functionally represents suboptimal iron stores for cellular energy production."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3 on Stool Analysis, a Calprotectin marker exceeding 50-100 μg/g is a significant clinical indicator of which physiological process?",
            "options": [
                "Insufficient pancreatic enzyme production",
                "Neutrophil-driven inflammation within the gastrointestinal mucosa",
                "The presence of Steatorrhea (fat malabsorption)",
                "Low secretory IgA (sIgA) indicating suppressed mucosal immunity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils during an inflammatory response in the gut. Levels above 50-100 μg/g suggest active mucosal inflammation, necessitating a distinction between IBD and IBS."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "On a DUTCH (Dried Urine Test for Comprehensive Hormones) panel, what does a finding of 'High Metabolized Cortisol' paired with 'Low Free Cortisol' typically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands are failing to produce cortisol (Addison's Disease).",
                "The body is clearing cortisol rapidly, often seen in hyperthyroidism or obesity.",
                "The client is in the 'Alarm' phase of the HPA-axis stress response.",
                "The 11β-HSD enzyme is deactivated, preventing the conversion of cortisone to cortisol."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High metabolized cortisol shows the adrenals are producing plenty of hormone, but low free cortisol shows it is being processed and cleared from circulation very quickly, often due to high insulin or thyroid overactivity."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In Lesson 5, the 'Toxic Burden' assessment identifies Glyphosate as a significant environmental disruptor. What is the primary mechanism by which Glyphosate interferes with human health according to recent data?",
            "options": [
                "It mimics estrogen and binds to ER-alpha receptors.",
                "It acts as a chelator of minerals and disrupts the Shikimate pathway in the gut microbiome.",
                "It directly inhibits the production of melatonin in the pineal gland.",
                "It causes immediate acute respiratory distress in 40% of the population."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While humans don't have a Shikimate pathway, our gut bacteria do. Glyphosate disrupts this pathway in the microbiome, leading to dysbiosis and the depletion of aromatic amino acids like tryptophan and tyrosine."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "During an Organic Acids Test (OAT), an elevation in 'Arabinose' is a specific metabolic byproduct associated with the overgrowth of which organism?",
            "options": [
                "Clostridia difficile",
                "Helicobacter pylori",
                "Candida albicans (Yeast)",
                "Oxalobacter formigenes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Arabinose is a five-carbon sugar produced by the breakdown of yeast cell walls. High levels on an OAT panel are a classic marker for intestinal Candida overgrowth."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client with a 'Slow COMT' (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) genetic variant should be cautious with high doses of which substances, due to potential increases in anxiety and estrogen dominance?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D and Magnesium",
                "Methyl donors and Catecholamines (like caffeine or stress)",
                "Omega-3 fatty acids and Zinc",
                "Probiotics and Fermented foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT enzyme breaks down dopamine, epinephrine, and estrogen. Those with a 'slow' variant clear these substances more slowly; adding excessive methyl donors or caffeine can lead to 'over-methylation' symptoms, anxiety, and poor estrogen clearance."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In the 'Data Synthesis' phase (Lesson 8), which of the following represents the correct 'Hierarchy of Intervention' when creating a Master Health Protocol?",
            "options": [
                "1. Hormones, 2. Gut Health, 3. Detoxification, 4. Genetics",
                "1. Genetics, 2. Hormones, 3. Lifestyle, 4. Gut Health",
                "1. Lifestyle/Circadian Rhythms, 2. Gut/Digestion, 3. Toxic Load, 4. Hormonal Balance",
                "1. Supplements, 2. Exercise, 3. Blood Work, 4. Diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The methodology prioritizes the foundations first: Lifestyle and Circadian biology, followed by the 'center' of health (the Gut), then clearing the 'bucket' (Toxic Load), before fine-tuning the 'messengers' (Hormones)."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 2022 study cited in the module showed that what percentage of 'asymptomatic' individuals actually displayed significant dysbiosis on a Comprehensive Stool Analysis?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 12%",
                "Exactly 25%",
                "Over 35%",
                "Nearly 60%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that a high percentage (over 35%) of people without overt GI symptoms still harbor significant pathogens or imbalances that may contribute to systemic issues like brain fog or skin conditions."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (42) presents with fatigue and weight gain. Her Blood Chem shows TSH 3.2 μIU/mL (Functional Range < 2.5) and her OAT shows high HPHPA. What is the most integrative priority?",
            "options": [
                "Prescribe a high-dose caffeine protocol to boost metabolism.",
                "Address the Clostridia overgrowth (indicated by HPHPA) which may be producing toxins that inhibit thyroid function and mitochondrial energy.",
                "Ignore the OAT and focus solely on Thyroid hormone replacement.",
                "Start a 3-day water fast to reset the microbiome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HPHPA is a marker for Clostridia, which produces metabolites that can inhibit the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine and create systemic metabolic stress. Addressing the gut pathogen is a root-cause approach to the fatigue and thyroid 'drift' Sarah is experiencing."
