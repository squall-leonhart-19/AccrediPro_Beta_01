            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesis is the process of identifying the 'Red Thread'—the underlying physiological or psychological connections that explain how various symptoms (e.g., fatigue, bloating, and skin rashes) are interrelated."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I' stands for Integrative, which expands the traditional SMART criteria to ensure the goal accounts for the client's emotional, spiritual, and physical interconnectedness."

                "It causes Vitamin C depletion",
                "It creates a risk of Serotonin Syndrome due to pharmacodynamic synergy",
                "St. John's Wort neutralizes the SSRI, making it completely inert",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Combining St. John's Wort with SSRIs creates a dangerous pharmacodynamic interaction that can lead to Serotonin Syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bio-individuality is heavily influenced by genetic polymorphisms (SNPs). For example, individuals with certain APOE variants may respond poorly to high saturated fat intake compared to the general population."
