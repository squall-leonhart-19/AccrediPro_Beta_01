            "question": "In the 'Synthesis' phase (L1), what is the primary objective when moving from assessment to actionable strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Identifying the 'Leverage Point' where one intervention impacts multiple systems",
                "Creating a list of every possible supplement the client could take",
                "Providing a definitive medical diagnosis based on holistic symptoms",
                "Immediately eliminating all processed foods regardless of client readiness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Synthesis phase focuses on identifying leverage points—interventions (like improving sleep) that create a 'domino effect' of positive changes across multiple physiological and psychological systems."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "The SMART-I framework (L2) adds an 'I' to traditional goal setting. What does this 'I' represent and why is it critical?",
            "options": [
                "Intermittent; ensuring the goal only happens occasionally to prevent burnout",
                "Inspirational/Integrative; aligning the goal with the client's deeper 'Why' and core values",
                "Institutional; ensuring the goal meets the standards of a medical facility",
                "Inexpensive; focusing only on interventions that have no financial cost"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'I' in SMART-I stands for Inspirational or Integrative. Research shows that goals tied to intrinsic values and a sense of purpose have a 60-70% higher long-term adherence rate than purely extrinsic goals."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When using the Prioritization Framework for complex cases (L3), which area should typically be addressed first according to the 'Integrative Hierarchy of Needs'?",

                "Advanced genomic testing and epigenetic interventions",
                "High-dose botanical protocols for specific symptom suppression",

                "Aggressive heavy metal detoxification protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Foundational biological rhythms must be stabilized first. Attempting complex interventions like detoxification on a body that is sleep-deprived or dehydrated often leads to 'healing crises' and poor outcomes."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Safety-Evidence Matrix' in L4, how should a coach handle a modality that has 'High Evidence of Efficacy' but 'Low Safety' (Potential Risks)?",
            "options": [
                "Recommend it immediately as the evidence justifies the risk",
                "Ignore the safety concerns if the client is desperate for results",
                "Classify it as 'Medical Referral Required' and collaborate with a licensed physician",
                "Replace it with a modality that has 'Low Evidence' but 'High Safety'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modalities with high efficacy but significant safety risks (such as specific pharmaceutical-grade herbs or restrictive diets) must be managed by or in collaboration with a licensed medical professional."

                "Everyone should avoid caffeine to maintain adrenal health",
                "One person may detoxify caffeine rapidly while another experiences anxiety from the same dose",

                "Genetics are 100% responsible for a client's health outcomes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CYP1A2 enzyme determines the rate of caffeine metabolism. This highlights bio-individuality: a 'healthy' substance for one person can be a physiological stressor for another based on their unique genetic blueprint."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Behavioral Architecture (L6) suggests that 'Choice Architecture' is more effective than willpower. What statistic supports the importance of environmental design?",
            "options": [
                "Willpower is a muscle that gets stronger the more a client uses it",
                "Approximately 45% of daily behaviors are repeated habits triggered by environmental cues",
                "90% of clients can maintain a diet through sheer discipline alone",
                "Environmental changes only account for 5% of weight loss success"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A study from Duke University found that nearly 45% of daily behaviors are habits. By changing the 'architecture' of the environment, we bypass the need for limited willpower."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort can lead to Serotonin Syndrome when combined with SSRIs. Identifying such herb-drug interactions is a critical component of risk management in holistic planning."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When using the SBAR protocol for Collaborative Care (L8), what does the 'R' stand for?",
            "options": [
                "Results; providing the lab values to the doctor",
                "Recommendation; stating clearly what you are asking the other provider to do",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The Recommendation phase is where the coach clearly communicates the proposed next step for the collaborative team."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In complex autoimmune cases, 'calming the terrain' via the nervous system and sleep is foundational. Aggressive dieting or exercise can increase cortisol, further triggering the autoimmune response."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "According to research on the Collaborative Care Model (L8), patient outcomes for chronic conditions improve by what percentage when a multi-disciplinary team is involved?",
            "options": [
                "Outcomes do not change, but costs increase",
