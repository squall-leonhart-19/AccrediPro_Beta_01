            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "According to the Metabolic Typing theory discussed in Lesson 1, a 'Protein Type' is characterized by a fast oxidative rate. What is the recommended macronutrient distribution for this metabolic profile?",
            "options": [
                "70% Carbohydrates, 20% Protein, 10% Fat",
                "40% Protein, 30% Fat, 30% Carbohydrates",
                "60% Fat, 35% Protein, 5% Carbohydrates",
                "50% Carbohydrates, 25% Protein, 25% Fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Protein types (fast oxidizers) require a higher percentage of proteins and fats (approximately 40/30/30) to slow down their oxidative rate and stabilize blood glucose levels."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, we analyzed functional blood chemistry. If a client presents with a Ferritin level of 18 ng/mL, how should an Integrative Health Coach interpret this, even if it falls within the 'standard' lab range (10-150 ng/mL)?",
            "options": [
                "The client has optimal iron stores for cellular energy.",
                "The client is at risk for iron overload and should avoid red meat.",
                "The client is in Stage 1 or 2 iron deficiency (subclinical), which can significantly impact mitochondrial function.",
                "The client has a bacterial infection, as Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional ranges for Ferritin are typically 50-100 ng/mL for women. A level of 18 ng/mL indicates subclinical depletion that standard medicine often misses but affects bio-individual vitality."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "IgG antibodies are responsible for delayed food sensitivities, making them difficult to identify without specific testing or a structured elimination diet."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The homozygous (two copies) C677T mutation results in a 60-70% reduction in enzyme efficiency, necessitating bio-individualized nutrient support like methylfolate."

                "To ensure the coach can charge more for the initial intake phase.",
                "Because standard lifestyle advice (like 'eat less, move more') fails if it contradicts an individual's unique genetic, metabolic, or toxicological profile.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bio-individuality is the filter through which all lifestyle interventions must pass. Without assessment, 'healthy' habits may actually be detrimental to a specific individual's needs."
