            "question": "A client's Metabolic Cart assessment reveals a Respiratory Quotient (RQ) of 0.72. Based on the W.H.O.L.E. framework, how should the coach interpret this data?",
            "options": [
                "The client is in a state of pure carbohydrate oxidation.",
                "The client is demonstrating high metabolic flexibility by primarily oxidizing fatty acids.",
                "The client is experiencing severe metabolic acidosis.",
                "The client is overtraining and utilizing muscle protein for fuel."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An RQ of 0.7 indicates pure fat oxidation, while 1.0 indicates pure carbohydrate oxidation. A value of 0.72 suggests the client is efficiently utilizing lipids as their primary fuel source, a hallmark of metabolic flexibility."

            "question": "When assessing biomarkers of longevity, a HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) score of 2.4 is calculated. What does this specifically indicate?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal insulin sensitivity with no risk of metabolic dysfunction.",
                "Early-stage insulin resistance, as scores above 1.9 indicate decreased sensitivity.",

                "The client is in a state of 'physiological insulin resistance' due to long-term ketosis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges vary, a HOMA-IR > 1.9 is generally considered the threshold for early insulin resistance, whereas a score < 1.0 is considered optimal for longevity."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A healthy CAR involves a 35-50% increase in cortisol within 30 minutes of waking. A flat CAR is a biomarker of HPA axis dysfunction, often seen in chronic stress, burnout, and systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While food and exercise are peripheral zeitgebers, light is the primary zeitgeber that resets the master clock in the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract."

            "options": [
                "It necessitates a high-saturated fat 'Keto' diet to bypass glucose metabolism.",
