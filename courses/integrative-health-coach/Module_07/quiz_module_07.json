            "question": "According to the W.H.O.L.E. Framework discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary physiological marker of metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "The ability of the body to maintain a constant blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL regardless of food intake.",
                "The capacity to efficiently switch between oxidizing carbohydrates and fats based on substrate availability.",
                "The total number of mitochondria present in skeletal muscle tissue as measured by biopsy.",
                "A fasting insulin level below 2.0 uIU/mL consistently for six months."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is defined as the organism's ability to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability. This involves switching between glucose oxidation during the postprandial (fed) state and lipid oxidation during the post-absorptive (fasted) state."

            "question": "In Lesson 2's discussion on biomarkers, the HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) is calculated using which two values?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c and Triglycerides",
                "Fasting Glucose and Fasting Insulin",

                "HDL Cholesterol and LDL Cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HOMA-IR is a validated clinical formula calculated as (Fasting Insulin [uIU/mL] × Fasting Glucose [mg/dL]) / 405. It provides a more accurate assessment of insulin sensitivity than fasting glucose alone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PGC-1alpha is the primary regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. It coordinates the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to increase mitochondrial mass and efficiency."

                "Approximately 50-85%",
                "Melatonin is not affected by blue light, only by total lux intensity."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that evening exposure to short-wavelength (blue) light can suppress melatonin levels by 50% to over 85%, significantly disrupting the circadian rhythm and metabolic signaling."

            "question": "A client presents with a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) report showing high 'Glycemic Variability' despite an HbA1c of 5.4%. Why is this variability a concern in Integrative Health?",
            "options": [
                "It isn't a concern; HbA1c is the only marker that correlates with long-term complications.",
                "High variability triggers greater oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction than stable high glucose.",
                "High variability indicates the client is consuming too much dietary fiber.",
                "It suggests the client's CGM is calibrated incorrectly."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycemic variability (the 'ups and downs' of blood sugar) is often more damaging than sustained high glucose because the rapid fluctuations trigger higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "According to the ATP III criteria for Metabolic Syndrome discussed in Lesson 7, which of the following combinations would result in a diagnosis?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays a role in processing folate. The C677T variant reduces the enzyme's efficiency, impacting methylation and homocysteine levels."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "What is the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Steal) concept described in Lesson 3 regarding endocrine balance?",
            "options": [
                "The body's tendency to prioritize the production of thyroid hormones over cortisol.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the HPA axis demands more cortisol. Because cortisol and sex hormones share the precursor pregnenolone, the body 'steals' the precursor to prioritize survival (cortisol) over reproduction (progesterone/testosterone)."

                "The leakage of protons from the inner mitochondrial membrane."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mitophagy is the quality-control mechanism where the cell identifies and recycles damaged mitochondria, preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular aging."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A fasting window of 12-14 hours (Time-Restricted Eating) is generally considered the threshold where the body shifts from exogenous glucose to endogenous fat stores and begins to improve insulin sensitivity and circadian alignment."
