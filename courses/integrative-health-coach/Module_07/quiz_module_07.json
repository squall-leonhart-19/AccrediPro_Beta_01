            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Basal Ganglia, specifically the striatum, is the primary brain region responsible for habit formation and 'chunking' behaviors into automatic patterns, allowing the Prefrontal Cortex to focus on other tasks."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the natural desire of practitioners to fix problems and offer advice, which often inadvertently increases client resistance and sustain talk."
