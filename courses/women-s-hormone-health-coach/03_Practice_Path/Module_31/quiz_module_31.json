            "question": "According to the 'Blue Ocean' niche strategy discussed in Lesson 1, why is 'General Women's Wellness' often an ineffective marketing position for a high-ticket coach?",
            "options": [
                "It lacks the specificity required to trigger the 'Problem-Aware' state in prospects with chronic hormonal issues.",
                "The price point for general wellness is legally capped in most jurisdictions.",
                "It requires a medical degree to market general wellness services.",
                "General wellness has a higher tax bracket for digital service providers."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "General niches compete on price in a 'Red Ocean.' High-value niches focus on specific problems (e.g., PMDD or Post-Pill PCOS), which resonates more deeply with prospects who feel their specific symptoms haven't been addressed by generalists."

            "question": "When optimizing a digital presence for 'E-E-A-T' (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), which element is most critical for a Hormone Health Coach's website?",
            "options": [
                "Having a high-resolution professional headshot on the homepage.",
                "Including a 'Medical Disclaimer' and citing peer-reviewed research in all educational blog posts.",
                "Using bright, neon colors to attract younger demographics.",
                "Ensuring the website loads in under 5 seconds on desktop devices."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because hormone health falls under 'Your Money or Your Life' (YMYL) content, Google and users prioritize trustworthiness. Citing research and providing clear disclaimers establishes professional authority and safety."

        {
            "id": "q31_3",
            "question": "In the 'Educational Authority' content model, what is the recommended 'Value-to-Pitch' ratio for social media platforms to maintain high engagement?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule ensures you build significant 'deposits' in your audience's trust bank through education and value before making a 'withdrawal' with a sales offer."

            "id": "q31_4",
            "question": "A coach notices their Instagram 'Reach' is high, but their 'Conversion' to discovery calls is low. According to Lesson 4, what is the most likely strategic gap?",
            "options": [
                "The coach is not using enough hashtags in their captions.",
                "The content is too 'Viral-Focused' and lacks a clear, specific Call to Action (CTA) that solves a pain point.",
                "The coach is posting at the wrong time of day for their time zone.",
                "The coach needs to switch to a personal profile instead of a business profile."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High reach without conversion usually indicates 'vanity metrics.' Effective hormone health marketing requires content that moves a follower from being 'Problem Aware' to 'Solution Aware' through specific CTAs."

            "options": [
                "To convince the client that their current doctor is incompetent.",
                "To show the client exactly how much money they have wasted on supplements.",
                "To help the prospect visualize the distance between their current hormonal symptoms and their desired health state.",
                "To explain the complex biochemistry of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Gap' is the space between where the client is (e.g., exhausted, irregular cycles) and where they want to be. Highlighting this gap ethically builds the necessity for change and investment."

            "id": "q31_6",
            "question": "When approaching a Functional Medicine practitioner for a referral partnership, what is the most effective 'Value Proposition' a coach can offer?",
            "options": [
                "Offering the practitioner a 50% commission on every referred client.",

                "Promising to mention the practitioner in an Instagram Story once a month."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Practitioners are often time-poor. A coach who can handle the 'heavy lifting' of lifestyle changes (which the doctor doesn't have time for) makes the doctor look better because the patient actually gets results."

            "question": "In Lesson 7, the 'Lead Magnet' is described as the entry point to a funnel. For a coach specializing in Perimenopause, which Lead Magnet would likely yield the highest quality leads?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-quality leads are attracted to specific solutions for their specific problems. A symptom tracker and lab guide are highly relevant to someone suspecting perimenopause, making them a 'warm' lead."

            "id": "q31_8",
            "question": "If your coaching business has a Client Acquisition Cost (CAC) of $200 and the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a client is $2,000, what is your LTV:CAC ratio, and is it considered healthy?",

                "1:10; Unhealthy because the cost is too high.",
                "10:1; Healthy, as it shows high ROI on marketing spend.",
                "2:1; Average for the coaching industry.",
                "5:1; Healthy, but needs immediate optimization."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 10:1 ratio (LTV is 10x the CAC) is exceptionally healthy in the coaching industry. Standard targets are usually 3:1 or higher for sustainable growth."

            "id": "q31_9",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what is the most effective way to scale a hormone coaching practice once you have reached capacity for 1-on-1 clients?",

                "Increase your working hours to 60+ per week.",
                "Stop taking new clients and start a waitlist indefinitely.",

                "Lower your prices to attract a higher volume of clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scaling requires decoupling time from income. Group programs or hybrid models allow you to serve more women effectively without increasing your 1-on-1 hourly requirements."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It is 5-7x cheaper to retain an existing client than to acquire a new one. A retention-first approach ensures a stable revenue base through alumni programs and high referral rates."
