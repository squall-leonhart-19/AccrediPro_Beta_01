            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Universality is the recognition of shared experiences and feelings among group members, which validates the client's experience and reduces the isolation and shame often felt with hormonal conditions."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 90-20-8 rule is a gold standard in adult learning: the brain can focus for 90 minutes, needs a change of pace every 20 minutes, and requires active participation every 8 minutes to maintain retention."

                "It allows for 'just-in-time' learning, building foundational habits like blood sugar regulation before introducing complex detox protocols",

                "It focuses on high-intensity exercise before addressing adrenal fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scaffolding involves building on prior knowledge. In hormone health, regulating blood sugar and circadian rhythms provides the physiological foundation necessary for more complex interventions like phase-specific detoxification."
