            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stabilizing the 'foundation'—blood sugar and the stress response (HPA axis)—is critical because sex hormone imbalances are often downstream symptoms of metabolic or adrenal dysfunction."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the Advanced Bio-Individual Assessment Framework, what does a 'narrowing' Heart Rate Variability (HRV) trend over 14 days most likely indicate?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A declining or narrowing HRV trend suggests the client's nervous system is under stress and is failing to recover, signaling a need to reduce protocol intensity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If the 'drainage' pathway (bowels) is blocked, toxins processed by the liver are reabsorbed in the colon, often worsening symptoms like acne and PMS."

                "Non-responders usually require 400% higher doses of Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 5 highlights that in 'stuck' cases, environmental factors like mold (mycotoxins) are often the hidden drivers of persistent inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D increases calcium absorption; K2 directs that calcium to bones rather than arteries, while Magnesium is a required cofactor for Vitamin D conversion."
