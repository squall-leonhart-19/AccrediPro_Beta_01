            "question": "According to the three pillars of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) discussed in Lesson 1, which component is equally as important as the 'best available research evidence'?",
            "options": [
                "Clinical expertise and client values/preferences",
                "Pharmaceutical industry guidelines",
                "Social media trends and influencer testimonials",
                "Governmental dietary guidelines only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "EBP is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and the unique values and preferences of the client."

            "question": "The 2017 and 2020 re-analyses of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data supported the 'Timing Hypothesis.' What does this hypothesis suggest?",
            "options": [
                "HRT should only be used for exactly 2 years regardless of age",
                "HRT is most effective when started 20 years after menopause",
                "HRT initiated within 10 years of menopause onset has a better benefit-risk profile for cardiovascular health",
                "The time of day HRT is administered is the most critical factor for safety"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Timing Hypothesis suggests that the cardiovascular risks observed in the WHI were largely due to the older age of participants (average 63) and that starting HRT closer to the onset of menopause (under age 60 or within 10 years of onset) is safer and potentially cardioprotective."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Based on the E3N cohort study data discussed in Lesson 3, how does the breast cancer risk of micronized progesterone compare to synthetic progestins like MPA?",
            "options": [
                "Micronized progesterone carries a significantly higher risk",
                "Micronized progesterone was associated with little to no increased risk for the first 5 years of use",
                "There is no difference between synthetic and bioidentical options",
                "Synthetic progestins were found to be safer for breast tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The E3N study and subsequent research indicate that micronized (bioidentical) progesterone does not carry the same increased risk of breast cancer seen with synthetic progestins like medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the treatment of PCOS and insulin resistance, which specific ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is supported by the majority of clinical evidence for restoring ovulation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol is the physiological ratio found in plasma and has been shown in multiple trials to be the most effective for improving metabolic and reproductive outcomes in PCOS."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a collection of enteric bacteria capable of metabolizing estrogens. Which enzyme do these bacteria produce that can lead to estrogen reabsorption?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "5-alpha reductase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Amylase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that deconjugates estrogens, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Why is the 'non-monotonic dose-response' of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) significant for hormone health coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It means that only very high doses of chemicals are dangerous",
                "It means that low-level exposures can sometimes have more significant hormonal effects than high-level exposures",
                "It proves that EDCs are processed linearly by the liver",
                "It suggests that EDCs are only harmful if consumed orally"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-monotonic responses mean the curve 'turns,' and low doses can interfere with the endocrine system in ways high doses do not, challenging the old toxicological adage that 'the dose makes the poison.'"

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which neurosteroid metabolite of progesterone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, explaining the sedative and anxiolytic effects of oral micronized progesterone?",

            "question": "When a practitioner encounters a 'Grade C' recommendation in clinical guidelines, how should this be translated to client work?",
            "options": [
                "The intervention should be forced upon all clients",
                "The intervention should never be used",
                "The evidence is weak or conflicting; the intervention should be discussed as an option based on individual context and preference",
                "Grade C means the evidence is definitive and requires no further discussion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grade C recommendations signify that the balance of benefits and harms is close or the evidence is lower quality, requiring personalized clinical judgment and client input."

            "question": "In the original WHI CEE+MPA arm, what was the reported 'absolute risk' increase for breast cancer, which is often contrasted with the 'relative risk' of 26%?",
            "options": [
                "500 additional cases per 10,000 women",
                "8 additional cases per 10,000 person-years",
                "1 in 2 women",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the relative risk increase was 26%, the absolute risk was small—only 8 additional cases of breast cancer per 10,000 women per year."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have shown that Berberine has comparable efficacy to Metformin in improving insulin resistance and reducing hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS."
