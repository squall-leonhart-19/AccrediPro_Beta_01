            "question": "In the 'Triad of Resistance' (PCOS, Subclinical Hypothyroidism, and Insulin Resistance), how does subclinical hypothyroidism specifically exacerbate insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the production of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG).",
                "By reducing the expression of GLUT4 glucose transporters in peripheral tissues.",
                "By overstimulating the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol.",
                "By causing a direct mutation in the insulin receptor gene."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones regulate glucose metabolism; subclinical hypothyroidism leads to reduced GLUT4 translocation, which impairs glucose uptake and directly contributes to insulin resistance."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A perimenopausal client with Hashimoto’s experiences a flare in thyroid symptoms despite stable T4 medication. Why might 'Estrogen Dominance' be the culprit?",
            "options": [
                "High estrogen levels increase Thyroid Binding Globulin (TBG), lowering the amount of free, bioavailable thyroid hormone.",
                "Estrogen directly inhibits the pituitary gland from secreting TSH.",
                "Estrogen causes the rapid destruction of the thyroid gland via TPO antibodies.",
                "Progesterone deficiency causes the body to stop converting T4 to T3 entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excess estrogen stimulates the liver to produce more TBG. This 'binds' more thyroid hormone, leaving less free T4 and free T3 available for the cells to use, effectively inducing hypothyroid symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "The 'Gut-Immune-Mast Cell Axis' in Endometriosis suggests that mast cells in the peritoneal fluid release histamine, which then:",
            "options": [
                "Decreases the production of prostaglandins.",
                "Stimulates the enzyme aromatase, increasing local estrogen production in lesions.",

                "Neutralizes Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the gut lining."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Histamine has a bidirectional relationship with estrogen; it stimulates mast cells to release more histamine and triggers aromatase, which increases local estrogen production, fueling endometriosis growth."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "In Post-Viral Endocrine Collapse (Lesson 4), what is the primary reason for the 'unrelenting fatigue' observed in clients?",

                "Excessive production of DHEA-S by the adrenal cortex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-viral syndromes often involve mitochondrial dysfunction where cells lose the ability to efficiently produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a state of cellular 'energy failure'."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "When assessing Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL), a Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD) is suspected if the luteal phase consistently lasts fewer than how many days?",

                "8 days"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase of less than 10 days is a clinical marker for Luteal Phase Deficiency, indicating insufficient progesterone production or a poor endometrial response, both of which increase RPL risk."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which laboratory finding is the most critical differentiator in diagnosing Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) versus Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA)?",
            "options": [
                "High FSH (>25-40 mIU/mL) in POI; Low or 'normal' FSH in FHA.",

                "High Prolactin in POI; Low Prolactin in FHA."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "POI is hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (high FSH because the brain is screaming at the ovaries to work), while FHA is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low/normal FSH because the brain has 'turned off' the signal)."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Complex PMDD.' What is the current scientific consensus regarding the cause of PMDD symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "A systemic deficiency in total progesterone levels.",
                "An overproduction of estrogen during the follicular phase.",

                "A lack of Vitamin B6 in the diet."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PMDD is not typically a hormone deficiency but a GABA-A receptor sensitivity issue where the brain reacts paradoxically to Allopregnanolone, a metabolite of progesterone."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "For the 'Unresponsive' client who has reached a plateau, which 'hidden' factor is most likely to cause bio-individual resistance to standard hormone protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Eating too many cruciferous vegetables.",
                "High toxic burden (e.g., mycotoxins or heavy metals) disrupting hormone receptor sensitivity.",
                "Taking a high-quality multivitamin.",
                "Exercising three times per week for 30 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental toxins like mycotoxins act as endocrine disruptors that can block hormone receptors or impair mitochondrial function, making a client 'resistant' to standard nutritional and lifestyle interventions."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "According to the module, a client with the 'Triad of Resistance' often shows a Fasting Insulin level above what threshold, even if their Fasting Glucose is normal?",

                "2 µIU/mL",
                "7 µIU/mL",

                "25 µIU/mL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' lab ranges go higher, functional medicine often identifies insulin resistance in complex hormone cases when fasting insulin exceeds 7 µIU/mL, indicating the pancreas is overworking to maintain glucose."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "In the context of Endometriosis and the Gut-Immune axis, what is the 'Leaky Gut' connection?",
            "options": [
                "LPS (Lipopolysaccharides) translocate into the pelvic cavity, triggering TLR4 receptors and worsening inflammation.",
                "The gut absorbs too much estrogen, leading to depletion.",
                "Fiber is lost through the intestinal wall, causing constipation.",
                "The stomach stops producing acid, preventing the breakdown of hormones."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Intestinal permeability (leaky gut) allows LPS from gram-negative bacteria to enter circulation and the pelvic environment, where they bind to TLR4 receptors, significantly increasing the inflammatory load and pain associated with Endometriosis."
