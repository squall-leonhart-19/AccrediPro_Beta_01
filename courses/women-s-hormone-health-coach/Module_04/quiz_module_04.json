            "question": "In the HPA Axis feedback loop, which signaling molecule is released by the hypothalamus to stimulate the anterior pituitary gland?",
            "options": [
                "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH)",
                "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)",
                "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)",
                "Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The hypothalamus initiates the stress response by releasing CRH, which then signals the pituitary to release ACTH."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is characterized by a cortisol increase of what percentage within 30-45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "30-40%",
                "50-75%",
                "Over 150%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A robust and healthy CAR typically shows a 50-75% increase over the waking value, indicating good HPA axis plasticity and anticipatory energy."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Shunt) occurs because pregnenolone is a shared precursor for cortisol and which other hormone?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin",
                "Progesterone",
                "Oxytocin",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Under chronic stress, the body prioritizes cortisol production, diverting the precursor pregnenolone away from the production of progesterone and DHEA."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Why is the term 'Adrenal Fatigue' clinically discouraged in favor of 'HPA Axis Dysfunction'?",
            "options": [
                "The adrenal glands are actually overproducing hormones in all stages.",
                "The pathology usually involves brain-level signaling and receptor sensitivity rather than gland failure.",
                "Adrenal glands do not have the capacity to become fatigued.",
                "It implies that cortisol is the only hormone affected by stress."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research shows that in most cases of stress-related exhaustion, the adrenal glands are capable of producing cortisol, but the central nervous system has downregulated the signaling (HPA axis) to protect the body."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Chronic cortisol elevation impacts metabolic health primarily by which mechanism?",

                "Increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue",
                "Inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver",

                "Decreasing the release of free fatty acids"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a glucocorticoid; it raises blood sugar by inducing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues so that glucose is reserved for the 'fight or flight' needs of the brain and heart."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which marker of gut immunity is typically suppressed during the 'Exhaustion' phase of HPA axis dysfunction, increasing the risk of dysbiosis?",
            "options": [
                "Calprotectin",
                "Secretory IgA (sIgA)",
                "Zonulin",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secretory IgA is the first line of immune defense in the gut; chronic stress initially raises but eventually depletes sIgA levels, compromising the mucosal barrier."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "A client presents with 'tired but wired' symptoms, specifically high cortisol at night and low cortisol in the morning. Which adaptogen is most appropriate for lowering evening cortisol?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is a calming (anxiolytic) adaptogen shown to reduce serum cortisol levels, making it ideal for evening use or for those with elevated cortisol."

            "id": "q4_8",

                "Respiratory Rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats; a higher HRV indicates better vagal tone and a more resilient nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "According to the 'Metabolic Cross-talk' lesson, what is the 'Cortisol-Insulin Trap'?",
            "options": [
                "High insulin causes cortisol to drop dangerously low.",
                "High cortisol triggers high insulin, which then prevents fat oxidation (lipolysis).",
                "Low cortisol causes the body to over-produce insulin to compensate for low energy.",
                "Insulin and cortisol compete for the same receptor sites in the brain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When cortisol is chronically high, it keeps blood sugar elevated. This forces the pancreas to secrete more insulin. High insulin, in turn, locks fat cells and prevents weight loss, even in a calorie deficit."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Nutritionally, which mineral is known as the 'anti-stress mineral' because it modulates the NMDA receptor and limits the release of ACTH?",

                "Calcium",
                "Magnesium",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium regulates the HPA axis by reducing the release of ACTH and protecting the brain from the excitatory effects of glutamate at the NMDA receptor."
