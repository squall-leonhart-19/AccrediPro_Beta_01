            "question": "According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which of the following cycle characteristics serves as a 'red flag' for endocrine dysfunction in an adult female?",
            "options": [
                "A cycle length of 28 days with 4 days of bleeding",
                "A follicular phase lasting exactly 14 days",
                "A cycle length consistently shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days",
                "Mild cramping on the first day of menses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ACOG and the Endocrine Society define the 'Vital Sign' parameters for adult menstrual cycles as 21–35 days; cycles outside this range indicate potential HPO axis dysfunction."

            "question": "Which PCOS phenotype, often referred to as 'Ovulatory PCOS,' presents with hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, but maintains regular ovulatory cycles?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A",
                "Phenotype B",
                "Phenotype C",
                "Phenotype D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenotype C (Ovulatory PCOS) includes hyperandrogenism and PCO morphology but lacks the chronic anovulation seen in Phenotypes A and B."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the context of PMDD, research indicates that the primary driver of symptoms is not 'hormone imbalance' (excess or deficiency), but rather:",
            "options": [
                "A total lack of progesterone production in the luteal phase",
                "An abnormal neuronal sensitivity to the metabolite Allopregnanolone (ALLO) and its effect on GABA-A receptors",
                "Excessive testosterone production during the ovulatory window",
                "A deficiency in Vitamin D3 preventing estrogen clearance"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PMDD is characterized by a genetic/molecular sensitivity to normal fluctuations of neurosteroids like Allopregnanolone, which causes a paradoxical reaction in the GABA-A receptors of the brain."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "What is the 'critical threshold' of Energy Availability (EA) identified in clinical research, below which the hypothalamus typically suppresses GnRH secretion leading to HA?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "20 kcal/kg of Total Body Weight per day",
                "1,200 total calories per day regardless of activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (Loucks et al.) shows that Energy Availability below 30 kcal/kg of FFM/day is the threshold where the HPG axis begins to downregulate to conserve energy."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "When analyzing a DUTCH test (Urinary Metabolites), a client shows a high 16α-OH-E1 pathway preference compared to the 2-OH-E1 pathway. This suggests:",
            "options": [
                "Optimal estrogen metabolism and low risk of proliferative issues",
                "A high risk of androgenic alopecia",
                "A preference for the 'proliferative' pathway, potentially increasing the risk of heavy bleeding and breast tenderness",
                "That the client is in a state of Hypothalamic Amenorrhea"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 16α-OH pathway is highly estrogenic and proliferative; a dominance here is often linked to symptoms of estrogen dominance like fibroids and heavy bleeding."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client with Endometriosis likely has an immune environment characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "Low levels of peritoneal macrophages",
                "Decreased production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha",
                "Increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and localized estrogen production within lesions via aromatase expression",
                "Complete absence of retrograde menstruation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Endometriotic lesions are unique in that they express aromatase (producing their own estrogen) and trigger a significant local and systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, TNF-alpha)."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' theory is largely considered outdated in functional endocrinology. What is the actual mechanism by which stress inhibits reproductive hormones?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol physically blocks the estrogen receptor",
                "CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone) and beta-endorphins directly inhibit the pulsatile release of GnRH in the hypothalamus",
                "The adrenal glands 'eat' the progesterone produced by the corpus luteum",
                "Stress increases SHBG so much that no estrogen is available"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HPA-HPG crosstalk occurs primarily in the brain, where stress signals (CRH) suppress the GnRH pulse generator, leading to lower LH/FSH and downstream sex hormones."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client presents with heavy menstrual bleeding (Menorrhagia). Her bloodwork shows a Ferritin level of 10 ng/mL. How does this low ferritin create a 'vicious cycle'?",
            "options": [
                "Low iron increases progesterone, which thins the lining",
                "Iron deficiency impairs the ability of the uterine myometrium to contract effectively, which can lead to even heavier bleeding",
                "Iron deficiency prevents the liver from detoxifying estrogen",
                "Low ferritin causes the follicle to rupture too early"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron is required for proper muscle function; iron deficiency can lead to uterine atony (poor muscle tone), preventing the spiral arteries from being clamped off effectively, thus worsening the bleeding."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key diagnostic distinction between Endometriosis and Adenomyosis?",
            "options": [
                "Endometriosis is inside the uterus; Adenomyosis is outside",
                "Adenomyosis involves the invasion of endometrial tissue into the myometrium (uterine muscle), while Endometriosis involves tissue growth outside the uterus",
                "Adenomyosis is caused by low estrogen; Endometriosis is caused by high estrogen",
                "Only Endometriosis causes painful periods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adenomyosis is often called 'endometriosis of the muscle' because the endometrial lining grows into the uterine wall (myometrium), whereas endometriosis occurs on the ovaries, bowels, or peritoneum."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "In Lean PCOS (BMI < 25), what is a common underlying driver that differs from the classic 'Obese PCOS' presentation?",
            "options": [
                "Lean PCOS never involves insulin resistance",
                "Lean PCOS is almost always caused by eating too much sugar",
                "Lean PCOS often involves a higher LH:FSH ratio and a more significant 'adrenal' androgen contribution (DHEA-S)",
                "Lean PCOS is treated only with weight loss"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While insulin resistance can still be present in lean PCOS (approx. 50-75%), these clients often show more pronounced neuroendocrine disruptions (high LH) and adrenal androgen excess compared to the metabolic-heavy presentation of obese PCOS."
