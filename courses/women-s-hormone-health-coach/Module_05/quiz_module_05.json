            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "In the Insulin-Ovarian axis, hyperinsulinemia drives hyperandrogenism through which primary mechanism in the ovaries?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulation of theca cells to increase CYP17 enzyme activity",
                "Inhibition of theca cells to prevent progesterone conversion",
                "Stimulation of granulosa cells to increase aromatase activity",
                "Downregulation of LH receptors on the ovarian surface"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High insulin levels directly stimulate the theca cells to increase the activity of the CYP17 enzyme, which accelerates the production of androgens (androstenedione and testosterone)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which Phase I estrogen metabolite is considered the most 'genotoxic' due to its ability to form unstable DNA adducts and quinones?",
            "options": [
                "2-hydroxyestrone (2-OH)",
                "16-alpha-hydroxyestrone (16-OH)",
                "4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH)",
                "Estriol (E3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH) is the most reactive metabolite; if not properly methylated in Phase II, it can oxidize into quinones that damage DNA, increasing the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to a collection of enteric bacteria capable of producing which enzyme that deconjugates estrogen for reabsorption?",
            "options": [
                "Aromatase",
                "Beta-glucuronidase",
                "Catechol-O-methyltransferase",
                "Sulphotransferase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the enzyme produced by specific gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid, allowing the 'active' estrogen to be reabsorbed into circulation rather than excreted."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to the HPA-HPO cross-talk, how does chronic high cortisol specifically interfere with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of the corpus luteum to LH",
                "It stimulates the rapid conversion of progesterone into cortisol (Pregnenolone Steal)",
                "It suppresses the GnRH pulse generator, leading to reduced LH frequency and lower progesterone production",
                "It increases the expression of progesterone receptors in the uterus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic HPA axis activation inhibits the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, which reduces the frequency of LH pulses required to stimulate the corpus luteum, resulting in lower progesterone levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In cases of Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (HA), leptin levels fall below a critical threshold. This deficiency primarily inhibits which signaling molecule required for GnRH release?",
            "options": [
                "Kisspeptin",
                "Ghrelin",
                "Adiponectin",
                "Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Leptin acts as a metabolic gatekeeper; when levels are too low, it fails to stimulate Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamus, which are the essential 'on switch' for GnRH and the entire reproductive axis."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (EDCs) like Bisphenol A (BPA) exhibit 'molecular mimicry.' What is a key characteristic of their interaction with hormone receptors?",
            "options": [
                "They only bind to receptors when natural hormones are absent",
                "They can bind to estrogen receptors and trigger a response even at extremely low, non-linear doses",
                "They are easily broken down by Phase II liver enzymes",
                "They have a higher affinity for receptors than endogenous estradiol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EDCs often follow a non-monotonic dose-response curve, meaning they can exert significant biological effects at very low concentrations by mimicking natural hormones and interfering with cellular signaling."

            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Regarding Circadian Biology, why is melatonin secretion crucial for ovarian health beyond its role in sleep?",
            "options": [
                "It converts testosterone into estrogen in the follicle",
                "It acts as a potent antioxidant in the follicular fluid, protecting the oocyte from oxidative stress",
                "It triggers the release of the egg during the LH surge",
                "It inhibits the production of prolactin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High concentrations of melatonin are found in the follicular fluid, where it serves as a critical antioxidant to protect the developing oocyte from ROS (reactive oxygen species) during the maturation process."

            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis suggested that what percentage of women with PCOS exhibit insulin resistance, regardless of whether they are 'lean' or 'obese'?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 25-30%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 75-80%",
                "Only those with a BMI over 30"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 75-80% of all women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance, highlighting that it is a core pathophysiological feature rather than just a result of weight."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "If a client has a COMT gene polymorphism (slow clearance) and low magnesium levels, which phase of estrogen detoxification is most likely impaired?",
            "options": [
                "Phase I (Hydroxylation)",
                "Phase II (Methylation)",
                "Phase III (Excretion/Bile flow)",
                "Phase IV (Cellular uptake)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COMT (Catechol-O-methyltransferase) enzyme is the primary driver of Phase II methylation, and it is magnesium-dependent. Impairment here leads to an accumulation of hydroxy-estrogens."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "During an Integrative Assessment, a client presents with a 'stair-step' basal body temperature (BBT) chart and a short luteal phase (9 days). This pattern most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen dominance due to poor Phase I clearance",
                "Luteal Phase Deficiency (LPD) likely driven by HPA axis stress",
                "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with high insulin",
                "Successful ovulation with optimal progesterone levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'stair-step' rise in BBT or a luteal phase shorter than 10 days are classic indicators of Luteal Phase Deficiency, often caused by insufficient progesterone production from the corpus luteum, frequently linked to HPA axis interference."
