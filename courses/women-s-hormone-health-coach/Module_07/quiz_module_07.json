        {
            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which enzyme, produced by specific bacteria in the estrobolome, is responsible for deconjugating estrogen, allowing it to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream?",
            "options": ["Alpha-amylase", "Beta-glucuronidase", "Lipoprotein lipase", "Aromatase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is the primary enzyme in the estrobolome that breaks the bond between glucuronic acid and estrogen, leading to the reabsorption of 'free' estrogen and potentially contributing to estrogen dominance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In Phase II liver detoxification, which pathway is specifically responsible for the clearance of most steroid hormones and approximately 40-70% of clinical drugs?",
            "options": ["Glucuronidation", "Sulfation", "Acetylation", "Methylation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Glucuronidation is the most prevalent Phase II pathway, utilizing glucuronic acid to make toxins and hormones water-soluble for excretion via the bile or urine."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "What is the primary risk if a client's Phase I detoxification is highly active (upregulated) while their Phase II pathways are sluggish (downregulated)?",
            "options": ["Rapid weight loss", "Excessive production of reactive intermediary metabolites", "Immediate depletion of Vitamin C", "Complete cessation of bile production"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase I converts toxins into intermediary metabolites that are often more reactive and toxic than the original substance. If Phase II cannot process these quickly, they cause significant oxidative stress and tissue damage."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Approximately what percentage of the conversion of T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) to T3 (active thyroid hormone) occurs in a healthy gut via the action of intestinal sulfatase?",
            "options": ["5%", "10%", "20%", "50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 20% of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the GI tract, highlighting the critical link between gut health and metabolic thyroid function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A client presents with 'greasy' stools, bloating after high-fat meals, and signs of estrogen dominance. Which 'Phase' of detoxification is likely the primary bottleneck?",
            "options": ["Phase I (Activation)", "Phase II (Conjugation)", "Phase III (Elimination/Biliary flow)", "Phase IV (Cellular transport)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Greasy stools (steatorrhea) and poor fat digestion indicate issues with bile flow and gallbladder function, which are central to Phase III elimination of conjugated hormones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which protein is the primary biomarker used to assess 'leaky gut' (intestinal permeability) as it regulates the opening of tight junctions between enterocytes?",
            "options": ["Albumin", "Zonulin", "Ferritin", "Calprotectin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is the only known physiological modulator of intercellular tight junctions; elevated levels are strongly associated with increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are endotoxins derived from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria. How do they primarily contribute to hormonal dysfunction?",
            "options": ["By increasing progesterone production", "By triggering systemic inflammation and impairing insulin receptor sensitivity", "By directly neutralizing thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)", "By increasing the absorption of Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS can cross a permeable gut barrier, entering systemic circulation and triggering an immune response that causes chronic low-grade inflammation, leading to insulin resistance and HPA-axis dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Environmental Endocrine Disruptors (EDCs) like Bisphenol A (BPA) are particularly problematic because they:",
            "options": ["Are destroyed by stomach acid", "Only affect the reproductive organs", "Can bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and mimic or block natural hormones", "Are water-soluble and excreted within minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EDCs are often lipophilic (fat-soluble) and have molecular structures similar to endogenous hormones, allowing them to bind to hormone receptors and disrupt the endocrine system's delicate signaling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Based on the module's coaching strategies, what is the recommended daily fiber intake to support the elimination of conjugated estrogens and maintain a healthy estrobolome?",
            "options": ["10-15 grams", "15-20 grams", "25-35 grams", "Over 60 grams"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A target of 25-35 grams of fiber per day (including both soluble and insoluble) is recommended to ensure adequate stool bulk and frequency for the clearance of metabolized hormones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which amino acid is the direct precursor to Glutathione, the body's 'master antioxidant' required for the Phase II conjugation of many environmental toxins?",
            "options": ["L-Lysine", "N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)", "L-Tyrosine", "L-Arginine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cysteine (often provided as NAC) is the rate-limiting amino acid for the synthesis of Glutathione, which is essential for the neutralization of reactive metabolites in the liver."
