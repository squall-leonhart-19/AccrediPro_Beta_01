            "question": "A healthy Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is characterized by a cortisol increase of what percentage within the first 30–45 minutes of waking?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",
                "35-60%",
                "75-100%",
                "Over 150%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A robust and healthy CAR is defined as a 35-60% increase over waking levels, reflecting high HPA axis plasticity and resilience. A blunted response (<35%) is often associated with burnout or chronic fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Which enzyme is primarily responsible for the peripheral conversion of T4 to the active T3 in the liver and kidneys, and is often inhibited by high systemic inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Type 1 Deiodinase (D1)",
                "Type 3 Deiodinase (D3)",
                "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO)",
                "Aromatase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Type 1 Deiodinase (D1) is the main enzyme for peripheral T3 production. It is highly sensitive to physiological stress and inflammation, which can shift conversion toward the inactive Reverse T3 (rT3)."

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) scale, a score above which threshold typically indicates early-stage insulin resistance in women?",
            "options": [
                "0.5",
                "1.2",
                "1.9",
                "3.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While 'normal' ranges vary, a HOMA-IR (Fasting Insulin x Fasting Glucose / 405) greater than 1.9 suggests the onset of insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 indicate significant resistance."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "During Phase I estrogen metabolism, which metabolite is considered most 'genotoxic' due to its ability to form depurinating DNA adducts if not properly neutralized by Phase II methylation?",
            "options": [
                "2-Hydroxyestrone (2-OH)",
                "16-alpha-Hydroxyestrone (16-OH)",
                "4-Hydroxyestrone (4-OH)",
                "Estriol (E3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "4-OH-E1 is the most reactive metabolite; it can oxidize into quinones that damage DNA. Efficient COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) activity is required to convert it into the stable 4-Methoxyestrone."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Progesterone's neuroprotective and sedative effects are largely mediated by its metabolite, Allopregnanolone, which acts as a positive allosteric modulator of which receptor?",
            "options": [
                "NMDA receptor",
                "GABA-A receptor",
                "Dopamine D2 receptor",
                "Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone binds to GABA-A receptors in the brain, enhancing the inhibitory effect of GABA. This explains why low progesterone levels in the luteal phase can lead to anxiety and insomnia."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "In the context of androgen balance, high activity of the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme in a female client is most likely to manifest as which clinical symptom?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive hair loss on the limbs",
                "Hirsutism and cystic acne",
                "Increased vaginal lubrication",
                "Lowered LDL cholesterol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-alpha-reductase enzyme converts Testosterone into the more potent Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). High activity of this pathway is a primary driver of androgenic symptoms like hirsutism and acne."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "The 'Estrobolome' refers to the collection of gut bacteria capable of producing which enzyme that deconjugates estrogens, allowing them to be reabsorbed into circulation?",
            "options": [
                "Amylase",
                "Lipase",

                "Protease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid. When elevated, it prevents the excretion of estrogen in the stool, leading to 'estrogen dominance' through enterohepatic recirculation."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Research on circadian biology indicates that exposure to blue light (approx. 460-480nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin for how long compared to green light exposure?",
            "options": [
                "The same duration",
                "Half as long",
                "Twice as long",
                "Four times as long"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that blue light exposure suppresses melatonin for about twice as long as green light of equal brightness and shifts the circadian phase by twice as much."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client presents with high Reverse T3 (rT3), normal TSH, and low-normal Free T3. She reports chronic high-stress levels. What is the most likely physiological mechanism occurring?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Iodine toxicity",
                "HPA-induced inhibition of 5'-deiodinase",
                "Pituitary adenoma"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation inhibits the 5'-deiodinase enzyme (which produces T3) and promotes the 5-deiodinase enzyme (which produces rT3), creating a 'metabolic brake' during times of stress."

            "question": "In PCOS phenotypes driven by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia directly stimulates which cells in the ovaries to increase the production of Androstenedione and Testosterone?",

                "Granulosa cells",
                "Theca cells",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH on the ovarian Theca cells to upregulate androgen production. This is a hallmark of the insulin-driven PCOS phenotype."
