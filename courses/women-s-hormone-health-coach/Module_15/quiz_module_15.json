            "question": "Which neurobiological change is primarily responsible for the narrowing of the thermoregulatory zone, leading to 'hot flashes' during the menopause transition?",
            "options": [
                "Hypertrophy of KNDy neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus",
                "Increased production of melatonin in the pineal gland",
                "Decreased sensitivity of the adrenal medulla to cortisol",
                "Downregulation of serotonin receptors in the prefrontal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The loss of estrogen leads to the hypertrophy of KNDy (Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B, and Dynorphin) neurons in the hypothalamus, which over-stimulate the thermoregulatory center, causing vasomotor symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Timing Hypothesis' discussed in Lesson 3, what is the critical window for initiating HRT to achieve maximum cardiovascular protection?",
            "options": [
                "Within 20 years of menopause onset or before age 75",
                "Only after age 65 to prevent late-stage atherosclerosis",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "At least 5 years after the final menstrual period to allow for stabilization"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Timing Hypothesis suggests that HRT is cardioprotective when initiated close to the onset of menopause (within 10 years or before age 60) while the endothelium is still relatively healthy."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the first five years following the final menstrual period, what is the average percentage of bone mass loss per year due to the withdrawal of estrogen's inhibition of RANKL?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% - 1.0%",
                "2.0% - 3.0%",
                "5.0% - 7.0%",
                "10% - 12%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen deficiency leads to increased RANKL activity and osteoclast survival, resulting in a rapid bone loss phase of approximately 2-3% per year in the early post-menopausal years."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which physiological change contributes to the increased risk of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM)?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in vaginal glycogen leading to overgrowth of yeast",
                "A decrease in vaginal pH from 4.5 to 3.0",
                "The loss of Lactobacillus species and a subsequent rise in vaginal pH",
                "Increased thickness of the bladder wall lining"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen loss reduces vaginal glycogen, which starves Lactobacillus. This causes the pH to rise (become more alkaline), allowing uropathogens like E. coli to colonize the area."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "To combat the anabolic resistance associated with sarcopenia in post-menopausal women, what protein intake range is recommended for muscle protein synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "0.6 - 0.8 g/kg of body weight",
                "0.8 - 1.0 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.5 g/kg of body weight",
                "2.5 - 3.0 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal women require higher protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/kg) combined with resistance training to overcome 'anabolic resistance' and maintain muscle mass."

            "question": "How does the brain's metabolism shift during the menopause transition, according to neuro-imaging studies discussed in Lesson 6?",
            "options": [
                "There is a 15-20% reduction in brain glucose metabolism, potentially leading to a 'bioenergetic crisis'",
                "The brain becomes hyper-metabolic, consuming 30% more glucose to compensate for heat loss",
                "There is a shift from using ketones to using only glucose for fuel",
                "Metabolism remains stable, but oxygen consumption increases significantly"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a key regulator of glucose metabolism in the brain. Its decline leads to a significant drop in glucose utilization, which may trigger the brain fog and cognitive risks associated with menopause."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "A client is at a slightly elevated risk for blood clots (VTE). Which form of estrogen therapy is generally preferred by clinicians due to its lack of 'first-pass' hepatic metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "Oral Conjugated Equine Estrogens (CEE)",
                "Oral micronized estradiol",
                "Transdermal 17β-estradiol (patch or gel)",
                "Synthetic progestins in pill form"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transdermal estrogen bypasses the liver, meaning it does not increase the production of clotting factors, making it a safer profile for those with VTE concerns compared to oral options."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between 'Bioidentical' Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) and traditional synthetic hormones like Premarin?",
            "options": [
                "BHRT is only available in health food stores",
                "BHRT has a molecular structure identical to the hormones produced by the human body",
                "Synthetic hormones are always safer for the heart",
                "BHRT does not require a prescription"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bioidentical hormones (like 17β-estradiol and micronized progesterone) are chemically identical to endogenous human hormones, whereas synthetic options (like CEE or MPA) are molecularly different."

            "question": "In the 'Second Spring' philosophy, the post-menopausal years are viewed as a time of:",
            "options": [
                "Inevitable decline and loss of vitality",
                "A transition from 'giving' energy (reproductive) to 'conserving and refining' energy (wisdom)",
                "Focusing exclusively on medical interventions to halt aging",
                "Returning to the hormonal profile of a pre-pubescent child"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Second Spring' (from Traditional Chinese Medicine) views menopause as a positive transition where energy previously used for reproduction is redirected toward personal growth, creativity, and wisdom."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 52-year-old client presents with 'visceral adiposity' despite no change in her caloric intake. Which hormonal shift is the most likely driver of this metabolic change?",
            "options": [
                "The shift from an estrogen-dominant to an androgen-dominant environment favoring central fat storage",
                "A sudden increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)",
                "The stabilization of progesterone levels",
                "A decrease in cortisol production"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The decline in estrogen, relative to continuing (though declining) androgen production, shifts fat distribution from the hips/thighs (gynoid) to the abdomen (android/visceral)."
