            "question": "In the context of PCOS phenotypes, which classification is characterized by hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) but maintains regular ovulatory cycles?",
            "options": [
                "Phenotype A (Classic)",
                "Phenotype B (Hyperandrogenic Anovulatory)",
                "Phenotype C (Ovulatory)",
                "Phenotype D (Non-androgenic)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenotype C, known as Ovulatory PCOS, presents with clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCOM on ultrasound, but the patient continues to have regular menstrual cycles, making it a frequently underdiagnosed phenotype in clinical practice."

            "question": "Endometriosis is increasingly recognized as an 'immune-endocrine' interface disorder. Which specific molecular mechanism contributes most significantly to the progesterone resistance observed in endometriotic lesions?",
            "options": [
                "Overexpression of Progesterone Receptor B (PR-B)",
                "Downregulation of Progesterone Receptor B (PR-B) and high E2-to-ERβ signaling",
                "Decreased aromatase activity within the lesion",
                "Excessive production of Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Endometriotic lesions exhibit a significant reduction or total absence of Progesterone Receptor B (PR-B). This, coupled with high Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) activity, creates a state of progesterone resistance and estrogen dominance within the local tissue environment."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "During the neuro-endocrine transition of perimenopause, which neurosteroid's decline is most closely associated with the increased prevalence of anxiety and sleep disturbances?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol",
                "Allopregnanolone (a metabolite of Progesterone)",
                "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)",
                "Androstenedione"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor. As progesterone levels fluctuate and eventually decline during perimenopause, the drop in allopregnanolone reduces GABAergic 'calming' signaling in the brain, leading to mood and sleep disruptions."

            "question": "A 55-year-old post-menopausal client presents with a sudden 15% increase in LDL cholesterol despite no changes in diet. According to the SWAN study data, what is the primary endocrine driver for this shift?",
            "options": [
                "Increased Testosterone production",
                "The loss of cardioprotective Estradiol and its effect on hepatic LDL receptor expression",
                "Decreased Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)",
                "Excessive intake of saturated fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The decline in estradiol during the menopause transition is directly linked to changes in lipid metabolism. Estradiol normally upregulates the expression of LDL receptors in the liver; its loss results in reduced LDL clearance and an atherogenic shift in the lipid profile."

            "question": "In Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA) and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), what is the critical 'threshold' of energy availability (EA) required to maintain normal luteal function in most women?",
            "options": [
                "15 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "20 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that energy availability below 30 kcal/kg of FFM/day disrupts the GnRH pulse generator, leading to reduced LH pulse frequency and subsequent menstrual disturbances, though some clinical markers of RED-S can appear even at higher EA levels."

            "question": "Regarding musculoskeletal integrity, how does estrogen deficiency specifically influence the bone remodeling cycle?",
            "options": [
                "It increases osteoblast activity and decreases osteoclast lifespan",
                "It decreases the production of RANK-L",
                "It promotes osteoclast apoptosis",
                "It increases the lifespan of osteoclasts and decreases the lifespan of osteoblasts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Estrogen normally exerts a pro-apoptotic effect on osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells) and an anti-apoptotic effect on osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). Deficiency leads to prolonged osteoclast activity and shortened osteoblast lifespan, resulting in net bone loss."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In cases of 'Advanced Thyroid-Gonadal Crosstalk,' why does primary hypothyroidism often lead to hyperprolactinemia and subsequent ovulatory dysfunction?",
            "options": [
                "Low T4 causes a compensatory rise in TRH, which directly stimulates pituitary lactotrophs to release Prolactin",
                "TSH directly binds to Prolactin receptors",
                "Hypothyroidism increases SHBG, which binds Prolactin",
                "Low T4 increases Progesterone, which triggers Prolactin release"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates both TSH and Prolactin. In primary hypothyroidism, the lack of negative feedback from T4 leads to elevated TRH, which can cause pathological elevations in Prolactin (Hyperprolactinemia), inhibiting GnRH secretion."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis highlighted the efficacy of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) for Endometriosis. What was the specific clinical outcome observed regarding endometrioma size?",
            "options": [
                "NAC had no effect on lesion size compared to placebo",
                "NAC was found to increase lesion size by stimulating blood flow",
                "NAC (600mg 3x/day) resulted in significant reduction or disappearance of endometriomas in 24% of participants",
                "NAC was only effective when combined with oral contraceptives"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies (notably Porpora et al.) have demonstrated that NAC supplementation can lead to a significant reduction in the mean diameter of endometriomas and, in some cases, complete disappearance of the cysts, likely due to its antioxidant and anti-proliferative effects."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which nutraceutical intervention is considered 'Gold Standard' for improving insulin sensitivity and restoring the LH/FSH ratio in PCOS patients, specifically using the 40:1 physiological ratio?",
            "options": [
                "Berberine and Chromium",
                "Myo-Inositol and D-Chiro-Inositol",
                "Vitex Agnus-Castus and Magnesium",
                "Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol mimics the physiological plasma ratio. Myo-inositol improves egg quality and FSH signaling, while D-chiro-inositol improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hyperandrogenism."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis in post-menopausal cardiovascular health suggests that Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has the most significant cardioprotective effect when started:",
            "options": [
                "At least 20 years after the onset of menopause",
                "Only after a client has developed hypertension",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "In women over the age of 75 to prevent stroke"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Window of Opportunity' suggests that HRT is cardioprotective when initiated close to the time of menopause (within 10 years or before age 60), as estrogen can maintain healthy endothelium. Starting HRT much later, when atherosclerosis is already established, may increase the risk of plaque rupture."
