            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "During the early neuroendocrine transition of perimenopause, what is the primary hormonal driver of heavy menstrual bleeding and shortened cycles?",
            "options": [
                "A consistent and rapid decline in Serum Estradiol levels",
                "Compensatory FSH elevations leading to erratic 'surges' of estrogen and luteal phase progesterone deficiency",

                "A 50% increase in Testosterone production by the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In early perimenopause, the brain increases FSH to stimulate aging ovaries, which often results in high, erratic estrogen levels ('Estrogen Storms') paired with insufficient progesterone due to anovulatory cycles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most rapid phase of bone loss occurs in the first five years post-menopause, where women can lose up to 10-20% of their total bone mass due to the sharp decline in estrogen's osteoprotective effects."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loss of estrogen leads to a decline in glycogen and Lactobacillus, causing the vaginal pH to rise above 4.5, which increases the risk for UTIs and irritation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While early perimenopause is often characterized by estrogen dominance, late perimenopause and menopause are defined by estrogen depletion, leading to vasomotor symptoms and tissue atrophy."
