            "question": "In the context of High-Performance Female Athletes, what is the 'threshold' of Energy Availability (EA) below which physiological functions like menstruation and bone turnover are typically impaired?",
            "options": [
                "45 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day",
                "20 kcal/kg of total body weight per day",
                "15 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that Energy Availability (EA) below 30 kcal/kg of Fat-Free Mass (FFM) per day is the critical threshold for the onset of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S), leading to luteal phase defects and suppressed bone formation."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Which endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) is specifically noted for its 'obesogen' effect by activating the PPAR-gamma receptor, thereby promoting adipogenesis?",
            "options": [
                "Phthalates",
                "Triclosan",
                "Parabens",
                "Organochlorine pesticides"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phthalates act as obesogens by activating Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs), specifically PPAR-gamma, which triggers the differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes (fat cells) and alters metabolic rate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "For neurodivergent clients (ADHD/Autism), why do symptoms often significantly worsen during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": [
                "Rising progesterone increases dopamine receptor sensitivity.",
                "Falling estrogen levels reduce dopamine synthesis and availability.",
                "High testosterone levels interfere with GABAergic signaling.",
                "Neurodivergent brains do not produce enough pregnenolone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen has a synergistic relationship with dopamine; it promotes dopamine synthesis and receptor density. When estrogen drops during the luteal phase, dopamine levels fall, which exacerbates ADHD symptoms and executive dysfunction."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In Reproductive Immunology, what is the significance of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance for a successful pregnancy?",
            "options": [
                "A Th1-dominant (pro-inflammatory) state is required throughout the entire pregnancy.",
                "A Th2-dominant (anti-inflammatory) state is required for initial implantation.",
                "A shift from Th1 to Th2 dominance is generally required to prevent fetal rejection.",
                "The balance is irrelevant as long as Natural Killer (NK) cells are low."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Successful pregnancy typically requires a shift toward a Th2-dominant (anti-inflammatory) environment. A persistent Th1-dominant state is often associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) due to an overactive maternal immune response against the fetus."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A client recovering from ER+ Breast Cancer is prescribed an Aromatase Inhibitor (AI). Which side effect profile is more common with AIs compared to Tamoxifen?",

                "Significant decrease in bone mineral density and joint pain",
                "Improved vaginal lubrication and libido"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike Tamoxifen, which has some estrogenic effects on bone, Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) block almost all estrogen production in postmenopausal women, leading to accelerated bone loss (osteoporosis) and arthralgia (joint pain)."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "What is the primary immunological link between Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis and Endometriosis as discussed in Module 27?",
            "options": [
                "Both are driven by a deficiency in Vitamin D alone.",
                "Both involve Th17 cell dominance and a breakdown in T-regulatory cell function.",
                "Endometriosis causes the production of TPO antibodies.",
                "Hashimoto's causes retrograde menstruation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Both conditions are characterized by an imbalance in the T-helper cell pathways, specifically an overactivity of Th17 (pro-inflammatory) cells and a failure of T-regulatory (Treg) cells to suppress the autoimmune/inflammatory response."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Exogenous testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Monitoring Hematocrit is essential to prevent polycythemia, which can increase the risk of vascular events like stroke or blood clots."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In Nutrigenomics, the CYP1B1 enzyme is responsible for converting estrogens into which metabolite, which is considered more 'genotoxic' if not properly methylated?",
            "options": [
                "2-Hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CYP1B1 converts estrogen into 4-Hydroxyestrone (4-OHE1). This metabolite can form DNA adducts and is considered potentially carcinogenic if it is not neutralized via methylation (COMT enzyme)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The clinical presentation of an athlete with amenorrhea, low gonadotropins (LH/FSH), and low estrogen, combined with a stress fracture, is a classic indication of Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea caused by Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S)."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to the advanced nutrigenomics lesson, which nutrient is a critical methyl donor required for the COMT enzyme to effectively clear catechol estrogens?",
            "options": [
                "Magnesium",
                "S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase) requires SAMe as the universal methyl donor and Magnesium as a cofactor to convert 2-OH and 4-OH estrogens into their inactive, water-soluble methoxy forms."
