            "question": "Which of the following clinical presentations represents an 'Emergency Red Flag' that requires immediate referral to an Emergency Room rather than a routine medical consultation?",
            "options": [
                "A client with PCOS reporting sudden hair thinning and acne flares.",
                "A client on HRT reporting sudden, unilateral calf pain, swelling, and redness.",
                "A client with Hashimoto’s reporting increased cold intolerance and dry skin.",
                "A client with PMDD reporting increased irritability and bloating."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sudden, unilateral calf swelling and pain are classic signs of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a medical emergency, especially in clients using exogenous hormones which can increase clotting risk."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the context of severe PMDD and suicidality (Lesson 2), what is the primary neuro-endocrine mechanism suspected to cause the acute crisis?",
            "options": [
                "A systemic deficiency in progesterone during the luteal phase.",
                "Excessive serum levels of estrogen causing 'estrogen dominance'.",
                "An abnormal GABAergic receptor sensitivity to the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone.",
                "Low levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) preventing ovulation."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that PMDD is not typically a hormone deficiency but a cellular sensitivity issue where the brain reacts abnormally to the fluctuating metabolite allopregnanolone, impacting GABA receptors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to the 2022 study by Pilver et al. discussed in the course, what percentage of women with PMDD have reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Approximately 12%",
                "Approximately 30%",
                "Approximately 55%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Statistics show that approximately 30% of women diagnosed with PMDD have attempted suicide, highlighting the 'Crisis' nature of this endocrine-driven mental health condition."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "When managing 'Metabolic Gridlock' in a client with PCOS and CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), which biomarker is often suppressed, leading to issues with ADH and chronic thirst?",
            "options": [
                "C-Reactive Protein (CRP)",
                "Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (MSH)",
                "Hemoglobin A1c",
                "DHEA-S"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In CIRS, MSH is frequently low. MSH regulates many things, including pituitary hormones; low MSH leads to low Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), causing the chronic thirst and frequent urination often seen in complex cases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A client using GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss presents with extreme fatigue and muscle wasting. What is the 'Metabolic Gridlock' priority for the coach?",

                "Switching the client to a juice cleanse to detoxify the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 medications can cause significant loss of lean muscle mass (sarcopenia). To prevent metabolic rate collapse, coaches must ensure adequate protein and resistance training."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "For a client in post-oncology endocrine restoration (Lesson 5), why are Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) particularly challenging for musculoskeletal health?",
            "options": [
                "They increase estrogen to toxic levels.",
                "They cause systemic inflammation in the gut lining.",
                "They suppress estrogen to near-zero levels, accelerating bone mineral density loss and joint pain.",
                "They cause excessive weight gain by slowing the thyroid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AIs block the conversion of androgens to estrogen in peripheral tissues. The resulting profound estrogen deprivation often leads to AI-Induced Musculoskeletal Syndrome (AIMSS) and rapid bone loss."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A client recently stopped a long-term combined oral contraceptive and is experiencing 'Post-Pill PCOS' symptoms. What is the physiological driver of this rebound effect?",
            "options": [
                "A temporary surge in adrenal and ovarian androgens as the pituitary-ovarian axis wakes up.",
                "A permanent destruction of the follicles in the ovaries.",
                "An immediate drop in insulin sensitivity caused by the lack of synthetic progestin.",
                "Excessive production of Prolactin from the pituitary gland."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Post-Pill PCOS is often a transient state where androgens surge after the suppressive effect of the pill is removed. It usually requires 3-9 months of support to stabilize."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which rare endocrine disorder is characterized by 'bronzing' of the skin, orthostatic hypotension, and life-threatening adrenal crisis under stress?",

                "PCOS"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addison’s disease involves the destruction of the adrenal cortex. The lack of cortisol and aldosterone leads to hyperpigmentation (bronzing) and the risk of a fatal adrenal crisis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "In Lesson 8 (Practitioner Sustainability), what is the 'Scope of Practice' boundary regarding a client in a mental health crisis?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should provide intensive counseling to resolve the trauma.",
                "The coach must recommend specific dosages of SSRIs or Lithium.",
                "The coach must facilitate a warm hand-off to a licensed mental health professional or crisis line while remaining as part of the support team for lifestyle factors.",
                "The coach should stop all communication with the client immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hormone coaches are not mental health crisis counselors. The protocol is to refer to specialists while continuing to support the physiological/lifestyle aspects of the case within a multidisciplinary team."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Cushingoid' features: central obesity, a 'buffalo hump,' and purple skin striae. What is the coach’s first priority?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cushing’s Syndrome (often caused by a pituitary or adrenal tumor) is a serious medical condition. A coach must recognize these physical signs and refer for clinical testing before any lifestyle interventions are attempted."
