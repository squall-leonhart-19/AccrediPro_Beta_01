            "question": "In Advanced Clinical Reasoning, which cognitive bias occurs when a practitioner relies too heavily on the first piece of information offered (e.g., an initial lab value) when making subsequent decisions?",
            "options": [
                "Confirmation Bias",
                "Anchoring Bias",
                "Availability Heuristic",
                "Blind Spot Bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchoring bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered. In hormone coaching, this often looks like fixating on a single 'low' lab value while ignoring the broader clinical picture and symptom clusters."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the Biopsychosocial Model and research on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), a 2019 meta-analysis indicated that individuals with high ACE scores are how many times more likely to experience chronic endocrine-related fatigue?",
            "options": [
                "1.5 times",
                "2.1 times",
                "2.7 times",
                "4.0 times"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that high ACE scores (4+) correlate with a 2.7x increased risk of chronic fatigue and significant HPA-axis dysregulation, necessitating a trauma-informed approach to hormone coaching."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When interpreting functional lab ratios, a Luteal Progesterone (ng/mL) to Estradiol (pg/mL) ratio of less than 100:1 most likely suggests which clinical pattern?",
            "options": [
                "Androgen Dominance",
                "Relative Estrogen Dominance",
                "Ovarian Failure",
                "Luteal Phase Defect only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both values may be within 'normal' lab ranges, a ratio below 100:1 (optimal is often 100-500:1) indicates Relative Estrogen Dominance, where progesterone is insufficient to antagonize the effects of estrogen."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "A client is taking Metformin for PCOS. Based on the principles of Integrative Pharmacology, which nutrient depletion should the Master Practitioner prioritize monitoring?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Magnesium Glycinate",
                "Vitamin B12",
                "Zinc"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Long-term Metformin use is clinically proven to deplete Vitamin B12 by interfering with its absorption in the ileum, which can exacerbate fatigue and neurological symptoms often mistaken for hormonal shifts."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "In the context of Mitochondrial Bioenergetics, what is the primary role of the PGC-1α transcriptional coactivator?",
            "options": [
                "Inhibiting glucose transport",
                "Promoting mitochondrial biogenesis",

                "Breaking down reactive oxygen species (ROS)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PGC-1α is the 'master regulator' of mitochondrial biogenesis. Master Practitioners use lifestyle interventions like cold exposure and zone 2 exercise to upregulate this pathway for improved metabolic flexibility."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "When working with high-complexity clients, the 'Righting Reflex' in Behavioral Change Psychology refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The client's ability to self-correct their diet",
                "The practitioner’s urge to fix the client's problems by providing immediate solutions",
                "A physiological response to thyroid hormone replacement",
                "The metabolic shift from glucose to ketone burning"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Righting Reflex is the practitioner's natural urge to 'fix' the client. In complex cases, this often triggers client resistance; Master Practitioners use Motivational Interviewing to let the client argue for change instead."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SBAR stands for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation. The 'Assessment' section involves the coach helping the client summarize what they believe the problem is based on tracked symptoms and data."

            "id": "q24_8",

            "options": [
                "Interpreting functional lab ratios for educational purposes",
                "Adjusting a client's prescribed thyroid medication dosage",
                "Suggesting a client discuss a specific nutraceutical with their doctor",
                "Providing a meal plan based on macronutrient ratios"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adjusting prescribed medication is a strictly medical act. A Master Practitioner may educate a client on how their medication works but must never alter dosages, which is outside the coaching scope of practice."

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah (42) presents with 'normal' TSH (2.1 mIU/L) but high Reverse T3 (28 ng/dL) and low Free T3. Which 'pattern' does this most likely represent in Advanced Clinical Reasoning?",
            "options": [
                "Primary Hypothyroidism",
                "Peripheral Thyroid Conversion Inhibition",
                "Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis",
                "Hyperthyroid Compensation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normal TSH with high RT3 and low FT3 suggests that the thyroid gland is producing hormone, but the body is 'shunting' T4 into the inactive RT3 form, often due to high cortisol, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "Nutraceutical Synergy: Why is Selenium often recommended alongside Myo-Inositol for clients with elevated thyroid antibodies?",
            "options": [
                "Selenium increases the absorption of Inositol in the gut",
                "Inositol regulates TSH, while Selenium supports the conversion of T4 to T3 and reduces TPO antibodies",
                "They combine to form a new compound that mimics Estrogen",
                "Selenium is required to prevent Inositol toxicity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Nordio et al., 2017) show that the combination of Myo-Inositol and Selenium is more effective at lowering TSH and TPO antibodies than Selenium alone due to their synergistic effect on thyroid signaling and antioxidant status."
