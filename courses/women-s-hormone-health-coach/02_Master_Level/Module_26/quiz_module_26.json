            "question": "In the 'Architecting the High-Level Hormone Coaching Framework' (L1), which four pillars are considered the metabolic foundation for all hormone interventions?",
            "options": [
                "Caloric Deficit, Cardio, Supplementation, and Sleep",
                "Blood Sugar Stability, Gut Health, Liver Detoxification, and Stress Resilience",
                "Estrogen Dominance, Progesterone Support, Thyroid Health, and Cortisol Control",
                "Macro Tracking, Micro-nutrient Density, Hydration, and Circadian Rhythm"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The framework prioritizes foundational metabolic health (Blood Sugar, Gut, Liver, and Stress) before addressing specific hormonal imbalances directly."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "During 'Stage 1: The Reset' of the 4-Stage Protocol for Hormonal Mastery, what is the primary objective of the intervention?",
            "options": [
                "To introduce high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to maximize fat loss",
                "To optimize the HPO axis through targeted bio-identical hormone replacement",
                "To reduce systemic inflammation and clear endocrine disruptors from the immediate environment",
                "To maximize metabolic flexibility through prolonged fasting protocols"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 1 (The Reset) focuses on lowering the 'toxic load' and systemic inflammation to sensitize hormone receptors before more aggressive interventions."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "A client presents with 'The Cortisol-Driven Menopause' archetype (L3). She exhibits high nocturnal cortisol and low DHEA. Which coaching strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Increase resistance training frequency to 5 days per week to boost testosterone",
                "Implement a strict ketogenic diet to lower insulin and manage weight",
                "Prioritize parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activation and shift exercise to low-impact restorative movement",
                "Prescribe high-dose caffeine to combat the associated daytime fatigue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cortisol-driven archetypes require nervous system regulation; high-intensity exercise or strict dieting often exacerbates their symptoms by further taxing the HPA axis."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In 'Advanced Data Integration' (L4), a coach notices a client's Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has dropped 22% below her 30-day baseline for three consecutive days. What is the recommended protocol?",
            "options": [
                "Increase the intensity of the scheduled workout to 'break through' the plateau",
                "Implement a 'Deload' or recovery day, as this indicates an overtaxed Autonomic Nervous System",
                "Ignore the data as HRV is too volatile to be used for weekly programming",
                "Suggest a 24-hour water fast to reset the metabolic rate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A significant drop in HRV (15-20%+) below baseline is a clinical indicator of poor recovery and physiological stress, necessitating a reduction in training volume."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to 'Nutritional Architecture' (L5), what is the evidence-based protein requirement for post-menopausal women to prevent sarcopenia and support bone density?",

                "2.5 - 3.0 grams per kilogram of body weight",
                "Protein intake is irrelevant as long as total calories are controlled"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal women require higher protein (1.2-1.6g/kg) due to anabolic resistance and the need to preserve Lean Body Mass (LBM) as estrogen declines."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "When programming exercise for 'Structural Resilience' (L6), why is heavy resistance training (60-80% 1RM) prioritized for perimenopausal clients?",
            "options": [
                "To increase estrogen production through muscle hypertrophy",
                "To provide the necessary mechanical loading to stimulate osteoblast activity and maintain bone mineral density",
                "Because it is the most effective way to improve cardiovascular VO2 max",
                "To decrease the client's appetite by suppressing ghrelin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heavy mechanical loading is essential for bone health (osteogenesis), which becomes a priority as the protective effects of estrogen on bone density diminish."

            "options": [
                "Concierge models are only for medical doctors, while group models are for coaches",
                "Concierge models offer high-frequency, individualized data mapping and personalized adjustments, while group models rely on a standardized curriculum",
                "Group models are more effective for clients with complex autoimmune conditions",
                "Concierge models prohibit the use of wearable technology"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Concierge coaching is defined by its high-touch, data-driven personalization, whereas group models maximize scalability through a shared protocol."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adjusting medication is a clinical act that falls strictly under the scope of a licensed medical provider; coaches must never alter prescriptions."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "In the 'Insulin-Resistant Menopausal Archetype' (L3), a client presents with a Fasting Insulin of 18 µIU/mL. What is the coaching priority for this data point?",
            "options": [
                "This is an optimal level; no intervention is needed",
                "The priority is to reduce insulin levels to <5 µIU/mL through carbohydrate management and timed movement",
                "The priority is to increase caloric intake to stimulate the thyroid",
                "The priority is to prescribe Metformin to manage the glucose levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An insulin level of 18 µIU/mL indicates significant insulin resistance. The coach's role is to use lifestyle and nutrition to drive this number toward the optimal range (<5-7 µIU/mL)."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "Which phase of the 4-Stage Protocol (L2) is dedicated to 'Metabolic Flexibility' and the strategic introduction of hormetic stressors like cold exposure or intermittent fasting?",
            "options": [
                "Stage 1: The Reset",
                "Stage 2: The Rebuild",

                "Stage 4: The Retain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stage 3 (The Refine) is where metabolic flexibility is mastered through strategic stressors, once the foundation (Reset) and nutrient status (Rebuild) are established."
