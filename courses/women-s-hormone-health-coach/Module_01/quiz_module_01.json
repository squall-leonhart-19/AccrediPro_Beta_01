            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which mechanism describes the primary 'genomic' action of steroid hormones once they cross the lipid bilayer of a target cell?",
            "options": [
                "Binding to G-protein coupled receptors on the cell membrane to trigger cAMP.",
                "Binding to intracellular receptors to act as transcription factors that alter gene expression.",
                "Directly neutralizing toxins within the cytoplasm via enzymatic degradation.",
                "Inhibiting the mitochondria to reduce ATP production and slow cellular metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Steroid hormones are lipophilic and pass through the cell membrane to bind with intracellular receptors. This hormone-receptor complex then moves into the nucleus to act as a transcription factor, regulating the synthesis of specific proteins."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "In the HPG Axis, how does the body respond to a 'negative feedback' signal when estrogen levels are sufficiently high during the early follicular phase?",
            "options": [
                "The hypothalamus increases GnRH secretion to stimulate more FSH.",
                "The anterior pituitary increases LH production to trigger immediate ovulation.",
                "The hypothalamus and pituitary decrease the secretion of GnRH and FSH, respectively.",
                "The adrenal glands take over the production of progesterone to balance the estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Negative feedback is the primary regulatory mechanism where rising levels of peripheral hormones (like estrogen) signal the hypothalamus and pituitary to reduce the output of tropic hormones (GnRH/FSH) to maintain homeostasis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "What is considered the 'rate-limiting step' in the biochemistry of steroidogenesis, often influenced by the StAR protein?",
            "options": [
                "The conversion of Testosterone to Estradiol via aromatase.",
                "The conversion of Progesterone to Cortisol in the adrenal cortex.",
                "The transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria and its conversion to Pregnenolone.",
                "The conjugation of Estriol with glucuronic acid in the liver."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by the enzyme CYP11A1 (P450scc) inside the mitochondria is the rate-limiting step for all steroid hormone production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to menstrual cycle physiology, what specific hormonal threshold is required to trigger the LH surge and subsequent ovulation?",
            "options": [
                "A drop in Progesterone below 1.5 ng/mL for 12 hours.",
                "A sustained rise in Estrogen (above 200 pg/mL) for approximately 48 hours.",
                "A peak in Inhibin B levels during the late luteal phase.",
                "The presence of high Testosterone levels in the follicular fluid."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike the rest of the cycle which relies on negative feedback, the LH surge is triggered by 'positive feedback' when estradiol remains above a specific threshold (approx. 200 pg/mL) for about 48 hours."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "In the context of the Estrobolome, what is the clinical significance of high levels of the enzyme Beta-glucuronidase?",
            "options": [
                "It speeds up the conversion of Estrone to the protective 2-OH pathway.",
                "It prevents the absorption of dietary phytoestrogens in the small intestine.",
                "It de-conjugates estrogen in the gut, allowing it to be reabsorbed into circulation.",
                "It increases the production of SHBG in the liver, lowering free estrogen."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucuronidase is an enzyme produced by certain gut bacteria that breaks the bond between estrogen and glucuronic acid (de-conjugation), leading to the reabsorption of estrogen and potentially contributing to estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Progesterone is often referred to as a 'neurosteroid.' Which receptor does its metabolite, Allopregnanolone, modulate to produce a calming effect?",
            "options": [
                "NMDA receptors (Glutamate)",
                "GABA-A receptors",
                "Dopamine D2 receptors",
                "Alpha-adrenergic receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, which provides the anxiolytic and sedative effects associated with healthy progesterone levels."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client has very low Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) due to underlying hyperinsulinemia. What is the likely impact on her hormone profile?",
            "options": [
                "Total testosterone will increase, but free testosterone will decrease.",
                "Her hormones will become 'trapped' and unable to bind to cellular receptors.",
                "The percentage of 'Free' (bioavailable) testosterone and estrogen will increase.",
                "The liver will stop producing estrogen metabolites entirely."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SHBG acts as a carrier; when SHBG is low, there is less 'buffer' in the blood, leading to a higher percentage of 'Free' or unbound hormones, which are biologically active and can exacerbate symptoms of androgen excess."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Which androgen is primarily produced in the adrenal glands and serves as the most abundant circulating steroid precursor in women?",
            "options": [
                "Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)",
                "Androstenedione",

                "Androstanediol glucuronide"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHEA-S is produced almost exclusively in the adrenal glands and is the most abundant circulating steroid, acting as a reservoir for the production of more potent androgens and estrogens."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "During Phase 1 Estrogen Metabolism, which pathway is generally considered 'pro-carcinogenic' if it becomes the dominant metabolic route?",
            "options": [
                "The 2-OH (2-hydroxyestrone) pathway.",
                "The 4-OH (4-hydroxyestrone) pathway.",

                "The Methylation pathway via COMT."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 4-OH pathway is considered potentially 'toxic' or pro-carcinogenic because it can lead to the formation of quinones that damage DNA, unlike the more stable 2-OH pathway."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'luteal phase defect,' characterized by a short luteal phase (9 days) and spotting. Based on Module 1, what is the most likely physiological cause?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive production of FSH during the ovulation window.",
                "Inadequate progesterone production by the corpus luteum.",
                "An overactive estrobolome causing rapid estrogen clearance.",
                "Premature surge of LH on Day 5 of the cycle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A luteal phase defect is typically characterized by insufficient progesterone production or a premature breakdown of the corpus luteum, leading to a luteal phase shorter than the ideal 12-14 days."
