            "question": "During the perimenopausal transition, what is the primary physiological driver behind the significant rise in Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)?",
            "options": [
                "A decrease in Inhibin B and a loss of negative feedback from declining estrogen levels.",
                "An overproduction of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) by the posterior pituitary.",
                "A compensatory mechanism by the adrenal glands to produce more DHEA.",
                "The upregulation of aromatase activity in visceral adipose tissue."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In perimenopause, as the ovarian follicle count diminishes, Inhibin B levels drop. This loss of feedback, combined with fluctuating estrogen, causes the pituitary to secrete higher levels of FSH in an attempt to stimulate the ovaries."

        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Neurobiology of the Menopausal Brain' lesson, the 'Brain Energy Gap' refers to which phenomenon?",
            "options": [
                "A 50% reduction in cerebral blood flow during hot flash episodes.",
                "The inability of the brain to utilize ketones during the luteal phase.",
                "A significant decline in glucose metabolism (hypometabolism) due to estrogen withdrawal.",
                "A total loss of synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a key regulator of glucose metabolism in the brain. As estrogen levels drop, the brain experiences a 'bioenergetic crisis' or 'energy gap,' where glucose utilization can drop by up to 20-25%, often leading to symptoms of 'brain fog'."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the context of the Estrogen-Osteoblast link, how does estrogen deficiency specifically accelerate bone resorption?",
            "options": [
                "By decreasing the production of Vitamin D in the skin.",
                "By increasing the expression of RANKL and decreasing Osteoprotegerin (OPG).",
                "By stimulating the parathyroid gland to release excess calcitonin.",
                "By causing the kidneys to excrete higher levels of calcium."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen normally stimulates OPG (the 'decoy' receptor) and suppresses RANKL. When estrogen is low, RANKL increases and OPG decreases, leading to over-activation of osteoclasts and rapid bone loss."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a significant shift in fat distribution from the hips to the midsection (visceral adiposity) despite no change in caloric intake. What metabolic shift is most likely responsible?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in subcutaneous adiponectin levels.",
                "A decrease in the LDL-to-HDL ratio.",
                "The loss of estrogen's suppressive effect on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the abdominal region.",
                "The upregulation of the GLUT-4 transporter in skeletal muscle."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen helps regulate fat distribution and inhibits LPL activity in the abdominal area. Its decline leads to 'metabolic re-patterning,' characterized by increased visceral fat and a higher risk of insulin resistance."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a defining characteristic of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) compared to other menopausal symptoms like vasomotor symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "GSM symptoms typically resolve spontaneously after 2-3 years.",
                "GSM is caused by an overproduction of vaginal glycogen.",
                "GSM is progressive and unlikely to improve without targeted local or systemic intervention.",
                "GSM only affects women who have had multiple vaginal births."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unlike vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), which may eventually subside, GSM is a chronic, progressive condition resulting from the atrophy of estrogen-dependent urogenital tissues and requires active management."

            "question": "How does the decline of progesterone in the late perimenopausal transition affect sleep architecture?",
            "options": [
                "It reduces the production of allopregnanolone, leading to decreased GABAergic signaling and increased sleep fragmentation.",
                "It causes a permanent shift in the circadian rhythm to a 'night owl' (delayed phase) chronotype.",
                "It increases the duration of REM sleep while eliminating Stage 3 (Deep) sleep.",
                "It leads to a total suppression of melatonin production by the pineal gland."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is metabolized into allopregnanolone, which acts on GABA-A receptors in the brain to promote sedation. Its decline results in more frequent awakenings and reduced sleep quality."

            "question": "To overcome 'Anabolic Resistance' in postmenopausal women (Lesson 7), what is the recommended 'Leucine Threshold' per meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis?",
            "options": [
                "0.5 grams of Leucine.",
                "Approximately 2.5 to 3.0 grams of Leucine.",
                "At least 10 grams of Leucine.",
                "Leucine is not required; only total caloric intake matters."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Postmenopausal women require a higher concentration of the amino acid Leucine (the 'anabolic trigger') to overcome age-related resistance to muscle building. This typically equates to 25-40g of high-quality protein per meal."

            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis for Cardiovascular Health suggests that HRT has the most protective effect when started:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that starting HRT within the 'window' (within 10 years of menopause or before age 60) provides cardiovascular benefits, whereas starting it much later may carry higher risks if plaque is already established."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS), especially night sweats, are now recognized as clinical markers for increased cardiovascular risk and adverse lipid profiles in midlife women."

            "options": [
                "Women can lose up to 10-20% of their bone density in the five to seven years following menopause.",
                "Bone loss only begins after the age of 75.",
                "Menopause increases bone density due to higher testosterone-to-estrogen ratios.",
                "Only 2% of postmenopausal women are at risk for osteopenia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The rapid decline in estrogen during the trans-menopause phase leads to an accelerated period of bone loss, where women can lose up to 20% of their total bone mineral density within the first few years after their final period."
