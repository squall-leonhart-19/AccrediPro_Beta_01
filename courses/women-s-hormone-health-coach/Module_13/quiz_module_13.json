            "question": "During the early perimenopausal transition, what is the primary neuroendocrine driver behind the intermittent 'spikes' in Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)?",
            "options": [
                "A permanent shutdown of the pituitary gland",
                "A decline in Inhibin B levels due to a reduced follicular pool",
                "An overproduction of progesterone from the adrenal glands",
                "A sudden increase in the number of primordial follicles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As the ovarian follicle pool declines, Inhibin B (which normally provides negative feedback to the pituitary) decreases, causing FSH to rise in an attempt to stimulate follicle development."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client in her mid-40s reports heavy periods, breast tenderness, and increased irritability. Why might she experience 'estrogen dominance' symptoms despite being in the menopause transition?",
            "options": [
                "Her body is producing more estrogen than it did in her 20s",
                "She is likely experiencing anovulatory cycles, leading to a lack of progesterone to oppose estrogen",
                "Estrogen receptors become 50% more sensitive during perimenopause",
                "The liver stops detoxifying estrogen entirely after age 40"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perimenopause is characterized by erratic cycles where ovulation may not occur. Without ovulation, the corpus luteum does not form, resulting in low progesterone levels that fail to balance even normal or fluctuating estrogen levels."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to longitudinal data from the SWAN study, what significant metabolic shift occurs during the 3-year window surrounding the final menstrual period (FMP)?",
            "options": [
                "A 10% increase in subcutaneous fat only",
                "A doubling of insulin sensitivity",
                "A significant increase in visceral adiposity (approximately 44%) regardless of BMI",
                "A decrease in LDL cholesterol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The menopause transition is associated with a 'metabolic re-wiring' where fat shifts from a gluteofemoral (pear) to a visceral (apple) distribution, with visceral fat increasing by roughly 44% on average."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "What is the estimated percentage of total bone mass that a woman may lose in the first 5 to 7 years following the onset of menopause?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 2%",
                "Approximately 5%",
                "Up to 20%",
                "Exactly 45%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The rapid decline in estrogen leads to accelerated osteoclast (bone-resorbing) activity, resulting in a loss of up to 20% of bone mineral density in the immediate post-menopausal years."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis suggests that Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) has the most favorable cardiovascular profile when initiated:",
            "options": [
                "At least 20 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only after the age of 75",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "Exclusively during the pre-menarche phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence suggests that starting HRT early (near the transition) helps maintain vascular health, whereas starting it much later may carry risks if atherosclerosis is already advanced."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Research into the 'Brain Fog' phenomenon using PET scans has shown that the menopausal transition is associated with which neurological change?",
            "options": [
                "A 25% increase in hippocampal volume",
                "A decline in brain glucose metabolism, specifically in the prefrontal cortex",
                "An increase in the speed of neural transmissions",
                "The complete disappearance of estrogen receptors in the brain"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen is a key regulator of glucose uptake in the brain. Its decline creates a bioenergetic deficit, leading to symptoms like memory lapses and difficulty concentrating."

                "The vaginal pH becomes more acidic (below 4.0)",
                "An increase in Lactobacillus species in the vaginal microbiome",
                "The vaginal pH becomes more alkaline (above 4.5) and the epithelial lining thins",
                "Increased collagen production in the pelvic floor muscles"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low estrogen reduces glycogen in vaginal tissues, which starves Lactobacillus. This causes the pH to rise (become more alkaline), leading to tissue fragility and increased infection risk."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A 2012 meta-analysis by Taku et al. found that soy isoflavone supplements (averaging 54mg/day for 6 weeks to 12 months) resulted in:",

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In the context of HRT, what is the primary benefit of using micronized progesterone (Prometrium) over synthetic progestins (like MPA)?",
            "options": [
                "It is 10 times more expensive",
                "It has a neutral effect on breast cancer risk for the first 5 years and is more 'cardio-friendly'",
                "It causes significant weight gain",
                "It must be taken as an injection only"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Micronized progesterone (bioidentical) has a better safety profile regarding breast health and cardiovascular markers compared to older synthetic progestins used in early WHI trials."

                "1.2 - 1.5g per kg of body weight, distributed across meals",

                "Exactly 10g per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-menopausal women require higher protein (1.2-1.5g/kg) combined with resistance training to overcome the decreased muscle protein synthesis associated with low estrogen."
