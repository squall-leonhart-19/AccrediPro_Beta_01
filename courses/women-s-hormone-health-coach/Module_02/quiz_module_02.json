            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which specific GnRH pulse frequency is required to preferentially stimulate the secretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary?",
            "options": [
                "Slow pulses (one pulse every 3-4 hours)",
                "Rapid pulses (one pulse every 60-90 minutes)",
                "Continuous, non-pulsatile secretion",
                "Ultra-slow pulses (one pulse every 12 hours)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the HPO axis, GnRH pulse frequency determines gonadotropin output. Rapid pulses (approx. every 60-90 mins) favor LH secretion, while slower pulses (every 2-3 hours) favor FSH secretion. This is critical in the follicular phase transition."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "What is considered the 'rate-limiting step' in the entire steroidogenesis pathway?",
            "options": [
                "The conversion of Pregnenolone to Progesterone via 3β-HSD",
                "The conversion of Testosterone to Estradiol via Aromatase",
                "The transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria via the StAR protein",
                "The conversion of DHEA to Androstenedione"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR) protein transports cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane. Without this step, cholesterol cannot reach the P450scc enzyme to begin the hormone assembly line."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Phase I Estrogen Metabolism, which metabolite is considered the most genotoxic due to its ability to form unstable DNA adducts if not properly methylated?",
            "options": [
                "2-Hydroxyestrone (2-OH)",
                "16α-Hydroxyestrone (16-OH)",

                "Estriol (E3)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "4-OH estrone can be oxidized into quinones, which are highly reactive and can cause DNA damage. This pathway requires efficient COMT (Phase II) activity for neutralization."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Progesterone's sedative and anxiolytic effects are primarily mediated by its metabolite, Allopregnanolone, acting on which receptor system?",

                "Dopamine D2 Receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allopregnanolone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors in the brain, which explains why low progesterone is often linked to anxiety and insomnia."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client presents with cystic acne and hirsutism. Lab work shows normal total testosterone but elevated 5α-reductase activity. Why does this explain her symptoms?",
            "options": [
                "5α-reductase converts Estrogen into Testosterone",

                "5α-reductase increases SHBG, leading to more bound hormones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHT has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone. Even with normal serum testosterone, high 5α-reductase activity creates a state of 'tissue-level' hyperandrogenism."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "How does chronic activation of the HPA axis (stress) directly interfere with the HPO axis at the hypothalamic level?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) and glucocorticoids directly suppress the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, leading to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea or luteal phase defects."

                "Low T3 levels increase the production of Aromatase",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 is required by the liver to produce SHBG. When T3 is low, SHBG drops, increasing the percentage of 'Free' (biologically active) estrogen and testosterone in circulation."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Hyperinsulinemia contributes to PCOS phenotypes by acting synergistically with which hormone to stimulate androgen production in the ovarian theca cells?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts as a co-gonadotropin. It enhances the response of theca cells to LH, leading to overproduction of androstenedione and testosterone."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A 2022 meta-analysis discussed in the course suggests that a 2-OH:16-OH estrogen ratio below what threshold is associated with increased proliferative risk in breast tissue?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines generally suggest that a ratio of 2-OH to 16-OH estrone greater than 2.0 is protective, as 2-OH is 'weak' and 16-OH is highly 'proliferative.'"
