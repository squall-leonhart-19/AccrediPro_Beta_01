        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "During the neuroendocrine transition of perimenopause, what is the primary cause of the 'narrowing of the thermoregulatory zone' that leads to hot flashes?",
            "options": [
                "A permanent increase in core body temperature",
                "Fluctuations in GnRH pulsatility affecting norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the hypothalamus",
                "A complete shutdown of the adrenal glands",
                "Excessive production of melatonin during daylight hours"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hot flashes are triggered by a narrowed thermoregulatory set-point in the hypothalamus, driven by the destabilization of neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and serotonin) resulting from erratic estrogen levels and GnRH pulse frequency."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In the postmenopausal state, which form of estrogen becomes the dominant circulating type, and what is its primary source?",
            "options": [
                "Estradiol (E2) produced by the ovaries",
                "Estriol (E3) produced by the liver",
                "Estrone (E1) produced via peripheral aromatization in adipose tissue",
                "Ethinylestradiol produced by the adrenal cortex"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As ovarian function ceases, Estradiol (E2) levels drop significantly. Estrone (E1), converted from androstenedione in peripheral tissues (especially fat), becomes the primary circulating estrogen."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "The decline of Progesterone in perimenopause impacts the nervous system primarily through the loss of which neurosteroid metabolite?",
            "options": [
                "Allopregnanolone",
                "Cortisol",
                "DHEA-S",
                "Androstenediol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Progesterone is a precursor to allopregnanolone, a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors. Its decline leads to increased anxiety, lower stress resilience, and sleep disturbances."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "To combat sarcopenia and the 'anabolic resistance' seen in the menopausal transition, what is the recommended protein intake for a 65kg menopausal woman?",
            "options": [
                "30-40 grams per day",
                "52 grams per day (0.8g/kg)",
                "78-98 grams per day (1.2-1.5g/kg)",
                "150-200 grams per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to the loss of estrogen's anabolic effects on muscle tissue, protein requirements increase to 1.2–1.5g/kg of body weight to maintain muscle mass and stimulate protein synthesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Estrogen deficiency impacts metabolic flexibility by impairing the translocation of which glucose transporter to the cell membrane?",

                "GLUT4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Estrogen facilitates the movement of GLUT4 (the insulin-regulated glucose transporter) to the cell surface. Loss of estrogen leads to reduced insulin sensitivity and higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "In the RANK/RANKL/OPG bone remodeling pathway, how does estrogen protect bone mineral density?",
            "options": [
                "By stimulating RANKL to activate osteoclasts",
                "By increasing the production of Osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL",
                "By inhibiting the production of Vitamin D",
                "By decreasing the activity of osteoblasts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen increases Osteoprotegerin (OPG), which binds to RANKL before it can activate osteoclasts. When estrogen drops, OPG drops, and RANKL is free to trigger excessive bone resorption."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of postmenopausal cardiovascular health shows that the loss of estrogen leads to a decrease in which cardioprotective molecule?",

                "C-Reactive Protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen stimulates endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS). The resulting decline in Nitric Oxide post-menopause leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "The 'Window of Opportunity' hypothesis suggests that HRT provides the greatest cardiovascular benefit when started:",
            "options": [
                "At least 20 years after the final menstrual period",
                "Only after the age of 75",
                "Within 10 years of menopause onset or before age 60",
                "Only if the client has existing heart disease"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical data suggests that initiating HRT within 10 years of menopause (the window of opportunity) is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk and lower mortality, whereas late initiation may carry different risks."

        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Which specific statistic accurately reflects bone loss during the early menopausal transition (the first 5 years post-FMP)?",
            "options": [
                "0.5% total loss",
                "A cumulative loss of 10-12% of total bone mass",
                "An increase in bone density due to compensatory testosterone",
                "Bone loss only occurs after age 80"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Women can lose up to 2-3% of their bone mineral density per year during the first five years following the final menstrual period, totaling roughly 10-12%."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client presents with new-onset visceral adiposity, 'brain fog,' and high LDL cholesterol despite no changes in diet. Which integrative approach is most supported by the module for this profile?",
            "options": [
                "A low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to lower cholesterol",
                "High-intensity steady-state cardio (60+ minutes daily)",
                "Resistance training combined with phytoestrogens (isoflavones) and metabolic support",
                "Complete avoidance of all dietary fats and proteins"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes resistance training to counter sarcopenia and metabolic shifts, while phytoestrogens (like soy isoflavones) can provide mild estrogenic support for lipid profiles and vasomotor symptoms."
