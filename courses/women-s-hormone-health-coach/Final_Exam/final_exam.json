        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the context of the HPA Axis (Module 4), which clinical marker is most indicative of a 'maladaptive' stress response where the body is prioritizing survival over sex hormone production?",
            "options": [
                "Elevated Total Cortisol with elevated DHEA-S",
                "High morning Cortisol with low Secretory IgA (sIgA)",

                "Fluctuating progesterone levels in the follicular phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) combined with low DHEA-S indicates HPA axis exhaustion or 'burnout,' where the body can no longer maintain the energetic demands of a robust stress response, often leading to downregulated reproductive function."

            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Gut-Hormone-Immune Axis' (Module 7), the 'Estrobolome' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The collection of estrogen-mimicking chemicals found in plastic products",

                "The ratio of Estradiol to Estriol in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome is the subset of the gut microbiome that produces beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogens, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream rather than excreted."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "In Module 12 (Perimenopause Continuum), research indicates that the 'Late Perimenopause' transition is clinically defined by which of the following?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The STRAW+10 staging system defines Late Perimenopause (Stage -1) as characterized by an interval of amenorrhea of 60 days or more, signifying the nearing of the final menstrual period."

                "They permanently destroy estrogen receptors in the liver",
                "They bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and elicit an amplified or distorted estrogenic response",
                "They prevent the thyroid from absorbing iodine",
                "They increase the rate of progesterone synthesis in the adrenal glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Xenoestrogens are molecular mimics that bind to estrogen receptors, often with different affinities than endogenous estradiol, leading to endocrine disruption and potential estrogen dominance symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_5",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that 75-95% of women with PCOS exhibit some degree of insulin resistance, which serves as a primary driver of androgen excess in the ovaries."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammation, high cortisol, and nutrient deficiencies can trigger the body to convert T4 into Reverse T3 (an inactive mirror molecule) instead of active T3, leading to 'Euthyroid Sick Syndrome' symptoms."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 16α-OHE1 metabolite is considered more 'proliferative' and potentially genotoxic, whereas 2-OHE1 is considered the 'safer' or more protective pathway. A high 16:2 ratio suggests a need for metabolic support."

            "id": "final_8",
            "question": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' theory, as discussed in Module 17 (Complex Scenarios), has been largely replaced in modern functional endocrinology by which concept?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Modern science shows that the 'steal' doesn't happen via substrate depletion, but rather through central nervous system signaling (HPA axis) which prioritizes the production of cortisol over sex hormones at the signaling level."

            "id": "final_9",
            "question": "During the Menopause Transition (Module 13), the loss of protective Estradiol is most significantly correlated with an increase in which cardiovascular marker?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The decline in estrogen leads to a shift in lipid profiles, typically increasing LDL and decreasing HDL, while also reducing arterial elasticity and nitric oxide production."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must focus on education, lifestyle, and supportive nutrition. Diagnosing, prescribing, or altering medications is strictly for licensed medical professionals."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": [
                "Estrogen stimulates mast cells to release histamine, and histamine stimulates the ovaries to produce more estrogen",
                "Progesterone increases the activity of the DAO enzyme",
                "Histamine prevents the liver from processing Vitamin D",
                "There is no known link between the two"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "There is a bidirectional relationship: Estrogen can trigger mast cell degranulation, while histamine can stimulate the production of LH and estradiol, creating a feedback loop."

            "id": "final_13",
            "question": "According to the Research & Evidence module (Module 19), why was the 2002 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study criticized in later years?",
            "options": [
                "The sample size was too small (n < 100)",
                "The average age of participants was 63, which did not reflect the 'typical' perimenopausal woman",
                "They only used bioidentical hormones",
                "The study lasted only 6 months"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHI study used an older cohort (average age 63.3) who were many years post-menopause, meaning the results regarding cardiovascular risk were not necessarily applicable to women in early perimenopause."
