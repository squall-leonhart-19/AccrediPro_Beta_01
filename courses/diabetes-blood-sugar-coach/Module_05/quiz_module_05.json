            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "During a chronic stress response (L3), how does elevated cortisol primarily contribute to hyperglycemia?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the rate of muscle protein synthesis",
                "By stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibiting peripheral glucose uptake",

                "By enhancing the binding affinity of insulin receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol promotes glucose production in the liver (gluconeogenesis) and decreases the translocation of GLUT4 transporters in skeletal muscle, leading to higher circulating blood sugar."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the context of Chrononutrition (L4), why does Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) typically result in better glycemic outcomes than late-night eating?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin levels are lowest in the morning, which enhances insulin secretion",
                "Insulin sensitivity naturally peaks in the evening to handle dinner loads",
                "The thermic effect of food (TEF) is significantly lower in the morning",
                "Melatonin, which rises in the evening, binds to MTNR1B receptors and inhibits insulin secretion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Melatonin has an inhibitory effect on insulin-producing beta cells; eating late when melatonin is high results in higher postprandial glucose levels compared to eating earlier."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "BPA and Phthalates are well-documented EDCs that interfere with metabolic signaling, often acting as 'obesogens' by promoting fat cell differentiation and insulin resistance."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Regarding Digital Hygiene (L6), exposure to blue light (460-480nm) within 2 hours of bedtime has what specific effect on metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the production of leptin, suppressing appetite",
                "It shifts the body into a deeper state of REM sleep",
                "It suppresses melatonin and increases next-morning postprandial glucose levels",
                "It has no measurable effect on glucose if the individual is wearing blue-light glasses"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Blue light suppression of melatonin not only disrupts sleep architecture but has been shown to impair glucose tolerance the following morning."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High HRV indicates strong vagal tone and parasympathetic dominance, which is associated with better glucose regulation and lower systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cooler sleep environments (60-67°F) facilitate the drop in core body temperature needed for deep sleep and can stimulate brown fat, which improves glucose clearance."
