            "question": "Which mechanism best describes how cortisol, released via the HPA axis, contributes to hyperglycemia?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the sensitivity of insulin receptors in skeletal muscle.",
                "It stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibits glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.",
                "It triggers the immediate destruction of beta cells in the pancreas.",
                "It increases the renal threshold for glucose excretion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol drives hyperglycemia by stimulating the liver to produce new glucose (gluconeogenesis) while simultaneously making peripheral tissues like muscle and fat more resistant to insulin's effects to ensure glucose remains available for the brain."

            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client presents with high fasting blood glucose (145 mg/dL). You ask them to test at 3:00 AM, and the result is 62 mg/dL. Which phenomenon is occurring?",
            "options": [
                "The Dawn Phenomenon",
                "The Somogyi Effect",
                "Reactive Hypoglycemia",
                "Diabetic Ketoacidosis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somogyi Effect is characterized by a drop in blood sugar during the night (hypoglycemia), which triggers a rebound hormonal response (cortisol/glucagon) leading to high fasting glucose in the morning."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "In the context of 'Leptin Resistance,' why do individuals with higher body fat percentages often feel hungrier despite having high leptin levels?",
            "options": [
                "Leptin is converted into ghrelin in the adipose tissue.",
                "High levels of circulating leptin fail to cross the blood-brain barrier or trigger the hypothalamus satiety signals.",
                "Leptin only works when insulin levels are below 5 uIU/mL.",
                "The body stops producing leptin once a certain fat threshold is reached."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Leptin resistance occurs when the brain no longer 'sees' the leptin signal due to inflammation or receptor desensitization, leading the brain to believe the body is starving despite ample fat stores."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "How does subclinical hypothyroidism typically impact glycemic control in Type 2 Diabetes patients?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the rate of insulin clearance, leading to lower blood sugar.",
                "It has no measurable effect on glucose metabolism.",
                "It reduces the expression of GLUT4 transporters and slows the rate of glucose disposal.",
                "It causes the pancreas to overproduce insulin, leading to chronic hypoglycemia."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormones regulate the expression of GLUT4 glucose transporters; a deficiency (hypothyroidism) leads to reduced glucose uptake into cells and slower metabolic clearance of insulin."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "What is the primary driver of hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS and insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin directly stimulates the theca cells of the ovaries to produce testosterone.",
                "High insulin levels suppress the pituitary gland's release of LH.",
                "Androgens are produced as a byproduct of glucose fermentation in the gut.",
                "Insulin increases Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), freeing up more testosterone."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hyperinsulinemia acts synergistically with LH to stimulate the ovarian theca cells, leading to excess androgen production, which is a hallmark of PCOS-related metabolic dysfunction."

            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "During menopause, the decline in Estradiol (E2) is associated with which metabolic shift?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in subcutaneous fat and a decrease in visceral fat.",
                "An increase in insulin sensitivity due to lower hormonal interference.",
                "A decrease in GLUT4 translocation and a shift toward central (visceral) adiposity.",
                "A permanent cessation of hepatic gluconeogenesis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estradiol is protective of insulin sensitivity; its decline during menopause leads to reduced GLUT4 translocation and a shift in fat storage toward the visceral (abdominal) region, increasing metabolic risk."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "According to the STABLE Method™ Phase 4, what is the 'Pregnenolone Steal' (or Cortisol Steal)?",
            "options": [
                "When the body uses progesterone precursors to prioritize cortisol production during chronic stress.",
                "When the liver steals glucose from the brain to fuel the muscles.",
                "When insulin 'steals' magnesium from the cells to process sugar.",
                "When the thyroid steals iodine from the adrenal glands."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Pregnenolone Steal' describes the biochemical pathway where the body prioritizes the production of the stress hormone cortisol over sex hormones like progesterone during periods of chronic HPA axis activation."

        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Research on the MTNR1B gene variant suggests that melatonin supplementation should be timed carefully because:",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin causes immediate insulin release.",
                "Melatonin can inhibit insulin secretion if taken too close to a carbohydrate-rich meal.",
                "Melatonin increases the risk of nighttime hypoglycemia in all users.",
                "Melatonin is only effective if taken at exactly 8:00 PM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors are found on pancreatic beta cells; taking melatonin (especially in those with the MTNR1B variant) too close to food can impair the glucose-stimulated insulin response, leading to higher postprandial glucose."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Which supplement ratio has shown the most clinical efficacy for improving insulin sensitivity and ovulation in women with PCOS?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol",
                "10:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol mimics the physiological ratio found in the blood and has been shown in numerous studies to be the most effective for metabolic and reproductive outcomes in PCOS."

            "question": "A client reports 'tired but wired' feelings at night, salt cravings, and mid-section weight gain despite a low-carb diet. Which endocrine support strategy is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 8:00 PM.",
                "Increasing caffeine intake to boost metabolic rate.",
                "HPA axis support using adaptogens like Ashwagandha and nervous system regulation.",
                "Strict 24-hour fasting twice per week."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms (tired but wired, salt cravings, abdominal fat) are classic signs of HPA axis dysregulation/adrenal fatigue. Supporting the HPA axis with adaptogens and calming the nervous system is the priority over further stressors like HIIT or extreme fasting."
