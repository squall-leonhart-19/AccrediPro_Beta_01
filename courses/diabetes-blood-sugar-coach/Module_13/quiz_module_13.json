            "question": "During the Initial Metabolic Assessment (Lesson 1), a client presents with a HOMA-IR score of 2.8. How should a STABLE coach interpret this data?",
            "options": [
                "The client is metabolically healthy with optimal insulin sensitivity.",
                "The client demonstrates significant insulin resistance and requires immediate Phase 1 intervention.",
                "The client has Type 1 Diabetes and requires immediate medical referral.",
                "The score is inconclusive and requires a 3-hour Glucose Tolerance Test."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while scores above 2.5 signify significant insulin resistance, necessitating the 'Reset' phase of the STABLE Method."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 1 focuses on stabilizing blood sugar swings (Glycemic Variability) and lowering chronic insulin levels to restore leptin sensitivity."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, why is the 'Wins-First' structure essential during the first 10 minutes of a weekly coaching call?",
            "options": [
                "To save time on data review.",
                "To trigger dopamine release and reinforce neuroplasticity related to new habits.",
                "To avoid discussing difficult biomarkers.",
                "To ensure the coach remains in a superior position."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on wins first leverages positive psychology, triggering dopamine which reinforces the neural pathways associated with the successful behaviors."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client reaches a weight loss plateau in Week 7 despite 100% dietary compliance. Based on Lesson 4, which factor is the most likely 'hidden' culprit in the STABLE framework?",
            "options": [
                "Lack of cardiovascular exercise.",
                "Inadequate protein intake.",
                "Elevated nocturnal cortisol due to poor sleep hygiene.",
                "Not enough 'cheat meals' to boost metabolism."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lesson 4 highlights that elevated cortisol (often from poor sleep or stress) triggers gluconeogenesis, raising blood sugar and insulin even in the absence of dietary carbs."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "In group coaching dynamics (Lesson 5), the 'Peer Effect' has been shown to improve HbA1c outcomes by what percentage compared to individual coaching alone?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies cited in Lesson 5 indicate that the social support and accountability of group dynamics can improve glycemic outcomes by over 30% compared to solo interventions."

            "options": [
                "The number of gym memberships used.",
                "The reduction in total employee body weight.",
                "The correlation between stabilized blood sugar and cognitive task performance/output.",
                "The cost of healthy snacks in the breakroom."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Presenteeism refers to being at work but unproductive; the STABLE method proves ROI by showing that stable blood sugar prevents the 'afternoon slump' and enhances cognitive output."

                "They lose 80% of their goal weight in the first 20 days.",
                "80% of their calories come from fats and 20% from protein."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 80/20 rule for maintenance allows for metabolic flexibility, meaning the body can handle occasional glucose excursions if 80% of the time the client follows the STABLE protocol."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all are important, HbA1c provides the 3-month average of blood sugar levels, making it the primary metric for long-term glycemic control and maintenance."
