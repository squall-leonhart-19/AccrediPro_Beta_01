            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which advanced biomarker is considered the most sensitive indicator of glycemic variability and postprandial glucose excursions over the preceding 1-2 weeks?",
            "options": [
                "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)",
                "Glycated Albumin",
                "1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG)",
                "Fasting Insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) levels drop rapidly when glucose exceeds the renal threshold (approx. 180 mg/dL), making it a precise marker for postprandial spikes that HbA1c might miss."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Akkermansia muciniphila is frequently cited in Lesson 2 as a 'keystone' species. What is its primary mechanism in improving metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing the production of zonulin to open tight junctions",
                "Strengthening the mucin layer and reducing metabolic endotoxemia (LPS leakage)",
                "Directly secreting insulin into the hepatic portal vein",
                "Fermenting protein into branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila degrades and regenerates the mucus lining of the gut, which prevents Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from entering systemic circulation and triggering TLR4-mediated insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to the principles of Chrono-nutrition (Lesson 3), why does late-night carbohydrate consumption typically result in higher glucose excursions?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin binds to MTNR1B receptors, inhibiting insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells",
                "The liver increases glycogen storage capacity at night",
                "Cortisol levels are at their highest peak at midnight",
                "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) activity is doubled during the dark phase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin, the sleep hormone, has an inhibitory effect on insulin secretion via the MTNR1B receptor to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia; eating when melatonin is high leads to glucose intolerance."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is described as having a 'dual nature.' When secreted by skeletal muscle during exercise (as a myokine), what is its primary metabolic effect?",
            "options": [
                "It increases systemic inflammation and worsens insulin resistance",
                "It stimulates glucose uptake via AMPK-mediated pathways and increases GLP-1 secretion",
                "It inhibits the browning of white adipose tissue",
                "It triggers the HPA axis to release excessive cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike adipose-derived IL-6, muscle-derived IL-6 acts as an anti-inflammatory myokine that enhances glucose disposal and stimulates the release of GLP-1 from L-cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis (Lesson 5) contributes to 'Metabolic Resistance' primarily through which mechanism?",

                "Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis",
                "Cortisol-induced translocation of GLUT4 and increased visceral adipogenesis",
                "Decreased secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol promotes visceral fat storage and interferes with GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane, effectively 'blocking' insulin's ability to move sugar into cells."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Environmental obesogens, such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and Phthalates, disrupt insulin signaling (Lesson 6) by acting as ligands for which nuclear receptor?",
            "options": [
                "PPAR-gamma (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma)",
                "Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1)",
                "Thyroid Hormone Receptor alpha",
                "Glucocorticoid Receptor"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Many obesogens are endocrine disruptors that activate PPAR-gamma, which triggers the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature fat cells and alters lipid metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "When coaching a diabetic athlete (Lesson 7), 'Late-onset Post-exercise Hypoglycemia' (LOPH) is a significant risk. When is this risk typically highest?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately (0-30 minutes) after the workout ends",
                "During the warm-up phase of the exercise",
                "6 to 15 hours after exercise, often during sleep",
                "Exactly 48 hours after the training session"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LOPH occurs as the body works to replenish muscle glycogen stores, which increases insulin sensitivity for several hours, often leading to nocturnal hypoglycemia if not managed."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the STABLE methodology for sustainable remission (Lesson 8), the 'E' stands for 'Environmental & Evolutionary Alignment.' What does this concept emphasize?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the client exercises at least 60 minutes daily",
                "Removing endocrine disruptors and aligning light/temperature exposure with biological needs",

                "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet permanently"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' focuses on optimizing the external environment (light, toxins, temperature) to match the evolutionary biological expectations of the human body."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client presents with a normal HbA1c of 5.4% but high Glycated Albumin levels. Based on Lesson 1, what does this discrepancy most likely suggest?",
            "options": [
                "The client has iron-deficiency anemia, making HbA1c falsely low",
                "The client has perfect glucose control",
                "The client has experienced recent (last 2-3 weeks) significant glycemic fluctuations",
                "The client is consuming too much dietary protein"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glycated Albumin reflects the average blood sugar over the last 2-3 weeks. A high GA with a normal HbA1c suggests recent loss of control or significant short-term fluctuations."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like Butyrate influence the 'Microbiome-Metabolism Axis' (Lesson 2) by:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs act as signaling molecules that bind to G-protein coupled receptors in the gut, triggering the release of satiety hormones (PYY) and insulin-stimulating hormones (GLP-1)."
