            "question": "According to the S.T.A.B.L.E. Triage framework, which clinical priority must be addressed before optimizing metabolic flexibility or hormonal synergy?",
            "options": [
                "Nutrient density and micronutrient status",
                "Safety and acute glycemic stability (hypo/hyperglycemia prevention)",
                "Circadian rhythm alignment and sleep hygiene",
                "Exercise periodization and GLUT4 upregulation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.T.A.B.L.E. Triage protocol dictates that Safety (preventing acute crises like hypoglycemia or DKA) is the absolute first priority before secondary metabolic optimizations can occur."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In 'Advanced Nutritional Architecture,' what is the recommended minimum fiber-to-total-carbohydrate ratio for promoting glycemic stability in insulin-resistant clients?",

                "1:2"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 1:5 ratio (e.g., 5g of fiber for every 25g of total carbs) is a clinical benchmark used to slow gastric emptying and reduce the post-prandial glucose spike."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Prescriptive Movement suggests that 'Exercise Snacking' (brief bouts of movement) is most effective for glucose disposal when performed at what time?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately upon waking in a fasted state",
                "15–30 minutes after the start of a meal",

                "Only during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-prandial movement, specifically 15–30 minutes after eating, leverages the peak glucose influx to maximize non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake via GLUT4 translocation."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "How does the 'Cortisol-Insulin Axis' explain the 'Dawn Phenomenon' in Type 2 Diabetes management?",
            "options": [
                "Low cortisol levels cause a drop in blood sugar at 3:00 AM",
                "Melatonin increases insulin sensitivity, leading to morning hypoglycemia",
                "Early morning cortisol surges stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis while insulin resistance is high",
                "High evening protein intake causes a delayed glucose spike 12 hours later"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dawn Phenomenon is driven by the natural circadian surge of cortisol, which triggers the liver to release glucose (gluconeogenesis); in insulin-resistant individuals, this is not adequately countered by insulin."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "The 'Circadian Optimization' protocol highlights that the MTNR1B gene variant can cause melatonin to have what effect on insulin secretion?",
            "options": [
                "It enhances insulin secretion, causing nighttime hypoglycemia",
                "It has no effect on the pancreas",
                "It can acutely inhibit insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells",
                "It converts white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin can inhibit insulin secretion. This is why the 'Dark Window' protocol recommends ending food intake 2–3 hours before sleep to avoid high glucose levels while insulin production is suppressed."

            "id": "q21_6",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (e.g., 'If I see dessert on the menu, then I will order herbal tea') are highly effective for automating healthy responses in high-risk environments."

                "At least 40%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines and CGM data analysis show that maintaining a TIR of >70% is strongly correlated with a reduction in microvascular complications."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In 'Crisis Management,' the 'Rule of 15' for treating hypoglycemia (glucose <70 mg/dL) requires which sequence?",
            "options": [
                "15g of fiber, wait 15 minutes, check ketones",
                "15g of fast-acting carbs, wait 15 minutes, re-test glucose",
                "15 minutes of exercise, 15g of protein, re-test glucose",
                "15 units of insulin, 15oz of water, wait 15 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of 15 involves consuming 15g of simple carbohydrates (like glucose tablets or juice) and re-testing after 15 minutes to ensure levels are rising safely."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "Why might 'Prescriptive Movement' include a reduction in high-intensity training during periods of high systemic stress (Hormonal Synergy)?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity training always lowers blood sugar too much",
                "Excessive HIIT can further elevate cortisol, exacerbating insulin resistance",
                "Diabetics cannot perform high-intensity exercise safely",
                "Movement has no effect on cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exercise is a stressor. If a client is already in a state of chronic cortisol elevation, excessive high-intensity training can worsen the hormonal imbalance and drive blood sugar higher via gluconeogenesis."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A client presents with high 'Glycemic Variability' despite low total carbohydrate intake. Which area of the Integrated Plan should be investigated first?",
            "options": [
                "Increasing total caloric intake",
                "Sleep quality and Circadian disruption",
                "Lowering protein intake to 0.5g/kg",
                "Eliminating all forms of resistance training"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycemic variability (large swings) is often driven by non-dietary factors like poor sleep, stress (cortisol), or circadian misalignment, even if carbohydrate intake is controlled."
