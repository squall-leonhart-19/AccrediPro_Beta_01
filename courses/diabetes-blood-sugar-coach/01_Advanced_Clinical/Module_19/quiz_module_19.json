            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors are present on pancreatic beta cells; when melatonin rises in the evening, it inhibits insulin secretion, making the body less equipped to handle glucose loads at night."

            "question": "A client presents a study claiming that 'diet soda causes diabetes.' Upon review, you see it is a large observational study with a high hazard ratio but no intervention. How should you interpret this?",
            "options": [
                "The study proves that diet soda causes insulin resistance",
                "The study shows a correlation, but cannot account for 'reverse causation' or confounding variables",
                "The study is a Meta-analysis and therefore represents absolute truth",
                "The study should be ignored because observational data is never useful"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Observational studies show associations (correlation) but cannot prove causation. Factors like 'reverse causation' (people at higher risk switching to diet soda) often confound these results."
