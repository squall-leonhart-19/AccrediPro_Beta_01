            "question": "A client with comorbid hypertension is prescribed a non-selective Beta-blocker. Why must a Blood Sugar Coach exercise extra caution with this client?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-blockers cause rapid weight gain by slowing the BMR by 15%.",
                "These medications can mask the autonomic symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tremors and palpitations.",
                "Beta-blockers increase the rate of gastric emptying, leading to postprandial spikes.",
                "They directly destroy pancreatic beta cells, accelerating the need for insulin."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-selective beta-blockers can mask the 'adrenergic' symptoms of hypoglycemia (tachycardia, tremors), making it difficult for the client to sense a low. They may also inhibit the breakdown of glycogen in response to low blood sugar."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Circadian Chaos, why is eating a large meal during a night shift (e.g., 2:00 AM) particularly detrimental to glycemic control?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin levels are high, which naturally inhibits insulin secretion from the pancreas.",
                "The body enters a state of 'nocturnal hypoglycemia' regardless of food intake.",
                "Digestive enzymes are only produced between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM.",
                "Cortisol is at its daily peak at 2:00 AM, causing immediate insulin resistance."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors are present on pancreatic beta cells; when melatonin is high (during the biological night), it suppresses insulin secretion, leading to significant glucose intolerance if food is consumed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which the decline of 17β-estradiol during menopause contributes to insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "It causes a 50% reduction in the number of insulin receptors on muscle cells.",
                "It leads to a decrease in GLUT4 translocation and an increase in pro-inflammatory visceral fat.",
                "It triggers a permanent state of ketosis that interferes with glucose signaling.",
                "Estrogen decline increases the renal threshold for glucose, preventing excretion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estradiol is protective of metabolic health; its decline reduces the expression of GLUT4 (the glucose transporter) and shifts fat storage from subcutaneous to visceral depots, which are more insulin-resistant."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which clinical feature would most strongly suggest a client has LADA (Type 1.5) rather than standard Type 2 Diabetes?",
            "options": [
                "The client has a BMI over 35 and significant acanthosis nigricans.",
                "The client is over the age of 70 and has high C-peptide levels.",
                "Rapid failure of oral glycemic medications in a non-obese client with positive GAD antibodies.",
                "The client shows immediate improvement with high-dose Metformin therapy."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LADA is an autoimmune form of diabetes. Key indicators include a lower BMI than the typical T2DM profile, presence of autoantibodies (like GAD65), and a quicker progression to requiring insulin because beta cells are being destroyed."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "An endurance athlete notices their blood sugar rises to 180 mg/dL during a high-intensity sprinting session. What is the physiological explanation for this?",
            "options": [
                "The athlete is experiencing 'Metabolic Adaptation' and burning muscle for fuel.",
                "High-intensity exercise triggers a catecholamine surge, causing hepatic glucose output to exceed peripheral uptake.",
                "The athlete's pancreas has temporarily stopped producing insulin due to physical stress.",
                "This is a sign of 'Athletic Ketoacidosis' and requires immediate medical intervention."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During high-intensity/anaerobic exercise, the surge in adrenaline and noradrenaline stimulates the liver to release glucose rapidly. Often, this release exceeds the rate at which the muscles can use it, causing a transient rise in blood sugar."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis leads to 'Stress-Induced Hyperglycemia.' Which process does cortisol stimulate in the liver to contribute to this?",
            "options": [
                "Glycogenesis (storage of glucose)",
                "Gluconeogenesis (creation of new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources)",
                "Lipogenesis (creation of new fat cells)",
                "Protein synthesis in the hepatocytes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that ensures the body has enough fuel during stress by stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver and antagonizing the effects of insulin in peripheral tissues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client with SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) struggles with glycemic variability. How does the 'Gut-Glucose Axis' explain this connection?",
            "options": [
                "Dysbiosis can impair the secretion of GLP-1 and increase intestinal permeability, leading to systemic inflammation.",
                "Gut bacteria consume all the dietary glucose, causing chronic hypoglycemia.",
                "SIBO bacteria produce insulin, leading to unpredictable 'crashes' after meals.",
                "The gut has no influence on glucose; the client likely has a hidden sugar addiction."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The gut produces incretin hormones like GLP-1 that stimulate insulin secretion. Dysbiosis and inflammation (Leaky Gut) can impair this signaling and induce insulin resistance via metabolic endotoxemia (LPS)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In Lesson 8, 'Metabolic Adaptation' is discussed as a reason for weight loss stalls. Which metabolic change is a hallmark of this 'stalled' state?",
            "options": [
                "An increase in Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) to compensate for less food.",
                "A decrease in Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) and a decline in active T3 thyroid hormone.",
                "An increase in Leptin levels which makes the client feel constantly full.",
                "A total cessation of glucagon production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As a survival mechanism during caloric restriction, the body reduces T3 (active thyroid) and suppresses NEAT (fidgeting, posture, subconscious movement) to conserve energy, making further weight loss difficult."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis cited in the course found that shift workers have a ____ higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes compared to day workers.",
            "options": [
                "10%",
                "25%",
                "40%",
                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently shows that shift workers face approximately a 40% increased risk of T2DM due to the chronic disruption of circadian rhythms and its impact on insulin sensitivity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "When troubleshooting a 'stalled' client who is strictly adherent to their diet, what is the recommended 'Metabolic Reset' strategy mentioned in Lesson 8?",
            "options": [
                "Reducing calories further to 500 kcal per day for one week.",
                "Implementing a 'Diet Break' or 'Maintenance Phase' for 2 weeks to normalize leptin and thyroid hormones.",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates and fats, consuming only protein powder.",
                "Increasing cardio duration to at least 2 hours per day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bringing a client back to maintenance calories (a 'diet break') for 1-2 weeks can help reverse some of the hormonal adaptations (like low T3 and Leptin) that occur during prolonged dieting, allowing for future progress."
