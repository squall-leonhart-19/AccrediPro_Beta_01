            "question": "A client’s Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) report shows a 'Time in Range' (TIR) of 62%. According to the International Consensus on TIR, what is the minimum target percentage recommended to significantly reduce the risk of microvascular complications?",
            "options": [
                "50%",
                "60%",
                "70%",
                "85%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The clinical gold standard for most adults with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes is a Time in Range (70-180 mg/dL) of greater than 70%, which correlates with an HbA1c of approximately 7.0%."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When calculating insulin resistance indices, the Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) Index is increasingly used. Which formula correctly represents the calculation of the TyG Index?",
            "options": [
                "ln[Fasting Triglycerides (mg/dL) × Fasting Glucose (mg/dL) / 2]",
                "Fasting Insulin × Fasting Glucose / 405",
                "(Triglycerides + HDL) / Glucose",
                "Total Cholesterol / HDL Ratio × 1.5"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The TyG Index is calculated as the natural logarithm (ln) of [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL) / 2]. It is a highly sensitive surrogate marker for insulin resistance, especially when insulin testing is unavailable."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In advanced lipidomics, why is Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) considered a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients than LDL-C?",
            "options": [
                "ApoB measures the amount of cholesterol inside the particles.",
                "ApoB provides a direct count of all atherogenic particles, including VLDL, IDL, and LDL.",
                "ApoB only measures the 'Large Buoyant' LDL particles which are most dangerous.",
                "ApoB levels are not affected by insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Every atherogenic particle (VLDL, IDL, Lp(a), and LDL) contains exactly one molecule of ApoB. Therefore, ApoB provides a precise particle count, which is a better risk predictor in diabetic patients who often have small, dense LDL particles."

            "question": "A client presents with an high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) level of 4.5 mg/L. According to the CDC/AHA risk categories, how should this be interpreted?",
            "options": [
                "Low Risk (< 1.0 mg/L)",
                "Average Risk (1.0 to 3.0 mg/L)",

                "Acute Inflammation/Infection (> 10.0 mg/L)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The CDC and American Heart Association categorize hs-CRP levels > 3.0 mg/L as 'High Risk' for cardiovascular events. Levels above 10 mg/L usually suggest acute infection rather than chronic metabolic inflammation."

                "8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Organic acid testing evaluates Krebs Cycle intermediates like citrate, isocitrate, and alpha-ketoglutarate. Shifts in these ratios indicate mitochondrial 'bottlenecks' that impair glucose oxidation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium that strengthens the gut lining. Low levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability, metabolic endotoxemia (LPS translocation), and obesity-related insulin resistance."

            "id": "q20_7",

                "MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) is specifically designed to measure the emotional, social, and regimen-related stress of living with diabetes, which is distinct from clinical depression measured by the PHQ-9."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A practitioner notices a consistent decline in a client's nocturnal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) via wearable data. In the context of metabolic health, this most likely indicates:",
            "options": [
                "Improved parasympathetic 'rest and digest' activity.",
                "Early signs of autonomic neuropathy or systemic physiological stress.",

                "The 'Dawn Phenomenon' occurring during REM sleep."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decrease in HRV indicates a shift toward sympathetic dominance and reduced vagal tone. In diabetic populations, this is often an early warning sign of cardiac autonomic neuropathy or poorly managed systemic inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Which biomarker of oxidative stress is considered the 'gold standard' for measuring systemic lipid peroxidation in vivo?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "F2-isoprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds formed by the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of essential fatty acids. They are considered the most reliable marker for assessing oxidative stress in clinical research."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When interpreting a Glycemic Management Indicator (GMI) from a 14-day CGM report, why might it differ from a laboratory HbA1c test performed on the same day?",
            "options": [
                "GMI is always 1% higher than HbA1c.",
                "HbA1c reflects a 90-day average, whereas GMI reflects the most recent 10-14 days of glucose data.",
                "GMI measures fructosamine, not glycated hemoglobin.",
                "Laboratory HbA1c is less accurate than CGM data in all populations."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose over the lifespan of a red blood cell (~90-120 days). GMI is a calculated estimate based on a shorter window of CGM data (typically 14 days), making it more reflective of recent behavioral changes."
