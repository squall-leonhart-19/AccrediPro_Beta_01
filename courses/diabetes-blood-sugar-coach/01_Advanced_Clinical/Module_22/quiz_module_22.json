            "question": "A client presents with unexplained weight loss, extreme thirst, and frequent urination but has not seen a doctor in two years. What is the coach's ethical obligation according to Lesson 1?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest the client start a Low-Glycemic Index diet immediately to manage symptoms.",
                "Inform the client they likely have Type 2 Diabetes and provide a meal plan.",

                "Recommend a specific brand of Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to track their levels before seeing a doctor."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never provide a clinical diagnosis. Presenting symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia) require a formal medical referral to ensure patient safety and legal compliance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting, tapering, or discontinuing prescription medication is strictly the domain of the prescribing physician. A coach's role is to provide the data the client can take to their doctor."

                "The study proved that supplements should always replace medications."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical supplement coaching requires acknowledging the gap between marketing ('nature's metformin') and actual clinical data, which often lacks the long-term safety profiles of FDA-approved drugs."

            "options": [
                "Because medical knowledge in chronic disease management is estimated to double or change significantly every 5-7 years.",
