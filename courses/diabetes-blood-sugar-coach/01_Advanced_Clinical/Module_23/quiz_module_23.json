            "question": "According to the International Consensus on Time in Range, what is the target Coefficient of Variation (CV) percentage recommended to ensure stable glucose levels and minimize hypoglycemia?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 25%",
                "Less than 36%",
                "Less than 45%",
                "Exactly 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Coefficient of Variation (CV) of <36% is the clinical threshold for stable glucose. Levels above this indicate high glucose variability, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia regardless of the average glucose."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "Which specific myokine, released during resistance training, is responsible for the 'browning' of white adipose tissue and stimulating GLUT4 translocation independent of insulin?",
            "options": [
                "Myostatin",
                "Interleukin-10",
                "Irisin",
                "Cortisol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Irisin is a potent myokine that promotes the conversion of white fat to beige fat (thermogenesis) and enhances glucose uptake in skeletal muscle via non-insulin-dependent pathways."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In the context of Chrononutrition, why does consuming a large carbohydrate-heavy meal late at night typically result in higher postprandial glucose compared to the morning?",
            "options": [
                "Melatonin inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells",
                "Cortisol levels are at their peak at midnight",

                "Muscle glycogen stores are always full at night"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin receptors (MTNR1B) are present on beta cells; high evening melatonin levels inhibit insulin secretion, leading to reduced glucose tolerance in the late evening."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A client presents with the 'risk' T-allele of the TCF7L2 gene. Based on precision nutrigenomics, how should their macronutrient profile be adjusted for optimal blood sugar control?",

                "Ketogenic diet with unlimited saturated fats"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with the TCF7L2 risk allele are more sensitive to high-glycemic loads. Research indicates they respond best to Mediterranean-style patterns rich in fiber and monounsaturated fats to mitigate insulin secretion defects."

                "To increase the glycemic index of staple foods"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility is the ability to efficiently switch substrate oxidation based on availability. Periodization trains the body to utilize fat during low-carb phases and handle glucose efficiently during high-carb phases."

                "The ratio of insulin to carbohydrates consumed"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GMI provides an estimate of what the lab A1c is likely to be based on the mean glucose captured by the CGM, though it may differ from lab values due to red blood cell lifespan variations."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Chronic cortisol elevation signals the liver to produce glucose (gluconeogenesis) while simultaneously making peripheral tissues (like muscle) more resistant to insulin to ensure glucose remains available for the brain."
