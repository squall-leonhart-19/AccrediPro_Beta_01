            "question": "A client presents with an A1c of 5.2% and a fasting glucose of 92 mg/dL, yet their fasting insulin is 24 μIU/mL. According to the Kraft patterns discussed in Lesson 1, what is the most likely metabolic status of this 'Hidden' Diabetic?",
            "options": [
                "Optimal metabolic health",
                "Stage 1 Insulin Resistance (Hyperinsulinemia)",
                "Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus",
                "Advanced Beta-cell exhaustion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A normal A1c can mask severe hyperinsulinemia. A fasting insulin of 24 μIU/mL is significantly elevated (optimal is typically <5-7 μIU/mL), indicating the body is overproducing insulin to maintain 'normal' glucose levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "In the context of PCOS (Lesson 2), how does hyperinsulinemia directly contribute to elevated free testosterone levels?",
            "options": [
                "By stimulating the adrenal glands to produce cortisol",
                "By inhibiting the pituitary gland's release of LH",
                "By stimulating ovarian theca cells and decreasing Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) production in the liver",
                "By increasing the conversion of estrogen into testosterone in adipose tissue"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Insulin acts synergistically with LH to stimulate theca cells to produce androgens and simultaneously suppresses the liver's production of SHBG, which increases the amount of free, active testosterone in the blood."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "For the 'High-Stress Executive' (Lesson 3), why might blood sugar remain elevated even during a strict ketogenic or low-carb diet?",
            "options": [
                "Excessive dietary fat is being converted to glucose via lipogenesis",
                "Chronic cortisol elevation triggers hepatic gluconeogenesis and impairs GLUT4 translocation",
                "The executive is likely consuming hidden sugars in black coffee",
                "Stress-induced hypothyroidism slows down glucose metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a counter-regulatory hormone that signals the liver to produce glucose (gluconeogenesis) to prepare for a 'fight or flight' response, while also making peripheral tissues more resistant to insulin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights that skeletal muscle is responsible for what percentage of postprandial (after-meal) glucose disposal?",
            "options": [
                "20-30%",
                "40-50%",
                "70-80%",
                "95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle is the primary 'sink' for glucose, accounting for approximately 70-80% of glucose disposal. This is why sarcopenia (muscle loss) is a major driver of insulin resistance in aging populations."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to Lesson 5, shift workers have a significantly higher risk of metabolic syndrome. What is the primary mechanism by which nocturnal light exposure disrupts glucose metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the appetite for protein-rich foods",
                "It suppresses melatonin, which normally binds to MTNR1B receptors to regulate insulin secretion",
                "It causes a permanent down-regulation of the thyroid gland",
                "It prevents the kidneys from excreting excess glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin plays a crucial role in pancreatic function. Disruption of the circadian rhythm via light exposure at night suppresses melatonin, leading to impaired insulin secretion and reduced glucose tolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A post-bariatric surgery client experiences sweating, shakiness, and a glucose drop to 55 mg/dL approximately 90 minutes after a high-carb meal. What is this phenomenon called?",
            "options": [
                "Early Dumping Syndrome",
                "Late Dumping Syndrome (Reactive Hypoglycemia)",
                "Bariatric Ketoacidosis",
                "Hypoglycemia Unawareness"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Late dumping syndrome, or reactive hypoglycemia, occurs when rapid gastric emptying causes an exaggerated GLP-1 and insulin surge, leading to a precipitous drop in blood sugar 1-3 hours after eating."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "The 'TOFI' client (Lesson 7) is characterized by which of the following body composition profiles?",
            "options": [
                "High BMI, high subcutaneous fat, low visceral fat",
                "Low BMI, low visceral fat, high muscle mass",
                "Normal/Low BMI, high visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and ectopic fat in the liver/pancreas",
                "High BMI, high muscle mass, low body fat percentage"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TOFI (Thin on the Outside, Fat on the Inside) individuals have a normal BMI but carry dangerous levels of visceral fat and ectopic fat (fat stored in organs), making them metabolically similar to obese individuals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the 'Chronic Relapser' case study (Lesson 8), the 'Abstinence Violation Effect' refers to:",
            "options": [
                "The metabolic adaptation that slows weight loss after a week of dieting",
                "The physical withdrawal symptoms from sugar addiction",
                "The psychological tendency to completely abandon a diet after a single minor 'slip-up'",
                "The body's inability to process glucose after a period of fasting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Abstinence Violation Effect is a cognitive behavioral concept where an individual perceives a minor lapse as a total failure, leading to a complete loss of control and a 'what the hell' effect."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "Which laboratory marker is often the most sensitive early indicator of metabolic dysfunction in a TOFI client, even if glucose is normal?",
            "options": [
                "Total Cholesterol",
                "Triglyceride-to-HDL Ratio",
                "Creatinine",
                "Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Triglyceride-to-HDL ratio is a strong surrogate marker for insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles, often elevated in TOFI individuals before A1c rises."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "What is the recommended nutritional strategy for a shift worker to minimize 'circadian misalignment' during a night shift?",
            "options": [
                "Eat the largest, high-carb meal at 3:00 AM to maintain energy",
                "Fast or consume small, protein/fat-focused meals during the night shift and avoid large meals during the biological night",
                "Consume high-caffeine energy drinks every 2 hours",
                "Eat a high-glucose snack immediately before going to sleep at 8:00 AM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To minimize metabolic disruption, shift workers should avoid large carbohydrate loads during their 'biological night' when insulin sensitivity is at its lowest, instead opting for smaller, protein-centric meals or intermittent fasting."
