        {
            "id": "final_1",
            "question": "In the STABLE Method™, the 'S' stands for Stabilization of Glycemic Variability. Why does the methodology prioritize Time in Range (TIR) over HbA1c as the primary metric for success?",
            "options": [
                "HbA1c is an outdated metric that has no clinical relevance in modern diabetes management.",
                "TIR provides a better representation of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation caused by frequent glucose fluctuations (spikes and dips).",
                "HbA1c cannot be measured by a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM).",
                "TIR is the only metric recognized by the American Diabetes Association for Type 2 management."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While HbA1c provides a 3-month average, it can mask significant glycemic variability. High variability (frequent spikes and crashes) is more closely linked to oxidative stress and endothelial damage than a stable but slightly elevated average."
