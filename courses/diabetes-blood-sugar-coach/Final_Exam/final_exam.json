            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' phase focuses on screening and assessment of insulin resistance and metabolic markers (like HOMA-IR and fasting insulin) to create a baseline. Coaches do not diagnose or prescribe medication."

            "question": "A client presents with a Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) of 108 mg/dL and a Fasting Insulin of 18 µIU/mL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and what does it indicate?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "(108 * 18) / 405 = 4.8. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, while scores above 2.9 indicate significant insulin resistance."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exercise triggers the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell membrane through insulin-independent pathways (AMPK activation), allowing glucose to enter the muscle cells even in insulin-resistant states."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a counter-regulatory hormone that opposes insulin. It promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver and decreases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues (muscles/fat), leading to elevated blood sugar."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS are endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria. When they leak into systemic circulation (leaky gut), they trigger TLR4 receptors, causing low-grade inflammation that directly interferes with insulin receptor signaling."
