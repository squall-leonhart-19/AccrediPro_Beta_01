            "question": "A client consumes a serving of watermelon which has a high Glycemic Index (GI) of 72, but a Glycemic Load (GL) of only 5. What does this discrepancy primarily indicate for blood sugar management?",
            "options": [
                "The food will cause a massive, sustained insulin spike regardless of portion size.",
                "The carbohydrate density is low, meaning the total glucose impact is minimal at standard servings.",
                "The fiber content in watermelon completely neutralizes the high sugar content.",
                "Watermelon should be strictly avoided by all Type 2 Diabetics due to the GI score."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glycemic Load (GL) accounts for portion size and carbohydrate density. While watermelon has a high GI (speed of absorption), its low GL (5) means it has a relatively small impact on total blood glucose levels when eaten in standard amounts."

            "question": "According to the Protein Leverage Hypothesis discussed in Lesson 2, what occurs when a diet is diluted with highly processed fats and carbohydrates?",
            "options": [
                "The body reduces total caloric intake to maintain protein balance.",
                "Glucagon levels rise significantly to compensate for the lack of amino acids.",
                "Overconsumption of total energy occurs as the body seeks to meet its fixed protein requirement.",
                "Insulin sensitivity improves because the protein-to-energy ratio is lowered."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis suggests that humans prioritize protein intake. When diets are low in protein percentage, individuals tend to overconsume total calories (fats/carbs) to reach their physiological protein target."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which specific lipid signaling mechanism is activated by Omega-3 fatty acids to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation?",
            "options": [
                "Activation of the GPR120 (FFAR4) receptor",
                "Suppression of the PPAR-gamma pathway",
                "Inhibition of the GLP-1 incretin hormone",
                "Stimulation of the CD36 fatty acid translocase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA) act as ligands for the GPR120 receptor, which exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects and enhances insulin signaling in adipose and muscle tissue."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 highlights Resistant Starch (RS). What is the primary mechanism by which 'Retrograded Starch' (RS3), formed by cooking and cooling potatoes, improves metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "It is absorbed in the small intestine, providing rapid energy without insulin.",
                "It bypasses the small intestine and is fermented into Butyrate by gut bacteria.",
                "It binds to dietary cholesterol and prevents its absorption in the duodenum.",
                "It increases the Glycemic Index of the meal by breaking down complex bonds."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RS3 is formed through retrogradation (cooling). It resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the colon, where it is fermented into Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which improves insulin sensitivity and gut barrier function."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In the 'Meal Sequencing' study (Lesson 5), what was the observed effect on the postprandial glucose incremental Area Under the Curve (iAUC) when vegetables and protein were eaten before carbohydrates?",
            "options": [
                "A negligible reduction of less than 5%",
                "A reduction of approximately 15-20%",
                "A reduction of approximately 30-40%",
                "An increase in glucose iAUC due to the 'Second Meal Effect'"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical trials (e.g., Shukla et al.) demonstrated that consuming fiber and protein first can reduce the glucose iAUC by 30-40% and peak insulin levels by nearly 25-30% compared to eating carbohydrates first."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Why does Lesson 6 recommend 'Front-Loading' calories (Early Time-Restricted Feeding) for clients with insulin resistance?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol levels are lowest in the morning, preventing glucose spikes.",
                "Melatonin secretion in the evening binds to MTNR1B receptors, inhibiting insulin release.",
                "The thermic effect of food (TEF) is non-existent after 8:00 PM.",
                "Glycogen stores are always full in the evening, leading to immediate fat storage."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucose tolerance follows a circadian rhythm. In the evening, the rise of melatonin interferes with the beta cells' ability to secrete insulin, making late-night carbohydrate consumption more glycemic than the same meal eaten earlier."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which micronutrient is a critical cofactor for the glucose transporter protein GLUT4 and has been shown in meta-analyses to reduce HbA1c by an average of 0.6% in deficient individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Vitamin C",
                "Magnesium",
                "Calcium",
                "Potassium"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is essential for insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and GLUT4 translocation. Supplementation in deficient individuals with T2DM has shown significant improvements in fasting glucose and HbA1c."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client's CGM data shows a 'Time in Range' (TIR) of 55%. According to the clinical standards discussed in Lesson 8, what is the primary goal for this client?",
            "options": [
                "Maintain 55% as it is above the 50% safety threshold.",
                "Increase TIR to >70% to significantly reduce the risk of microvascular complications.",
                "Switch to finger-prick testing only, as CGM data is too volatile.",
                "Focus exclusively on lowering the peak glucose regardless of the TIR."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The clinical gold standard for Time in Range (70-180 mg/dL) is >70%. Every 10% increase in TIR is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of retinopathy and albuminuria."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "During the 'T' Phase, a coach notices a client's morning fasting glucose is consistently high (130 mg/dL) despite a low-carb dinner. This is likely the 'Dawn Phenomenon.' What is the recommended nutritional adjustment?",
            "options": [
                "Increase carbohydrate intake at 10:00 PM to suppress glucagon.",
                "Implement a 24-hour fast to deplete liver glycogen.",
                "Move the carbohydrate window to earlier in the day and ensure adequate protein at dinner.",
                "Strictly limit water intake after 8:00 PM."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dawn Phenomenon is caused by a surge in growth hormone and cortisol. Moving carbohydrates earlier (circadian alignment) and ensuring protein at dinner (to stabilize the glucagon-insulin ratio) helps manage the hepatic glucose output overnight."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Second Meal Effect' as described in the context of fiber and resistant starch?",
            "options": [
                "The tendency to eat more at dinner if breakfast was skipped.",
                "The phenomenon where a high-fiber meal improves the glycemic response to a subsequent meal.",
                "The rapid rise in insulin that occurs exactly two hours after a high-fat meal.",
                "The fermentation of protein in the colon leading to increased urea production."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Second Meal Effect' refers to the ability of certain foods (especially those high in viscous fiber or resistant starch) to improve glucose tolerance not just for the current meal, but for the following meal as well, often by slowing gastric emptying and modulating fermentation products."
