            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "According to the research discussed in Lesson 1, why is Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursions (MAGE) considered more damaging than sustained hyperglycemia?",
            "options": [
                "It causes higher levels of HbA1c over a 3-month period.",
                "Fluctuating glucose levels trigger higher levels of oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines than stable high glucose.",
                "MAGE is easier to measure with a standard finger-prick glucometer.",
                "Sustained hyperglycemia allows the body to adapt, whereas variability causes weight gain."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that 'glucose spikes' trigger a more significant production of nitrotyrosine and 8-iso-PGF2α (markers of oxidative stress) compared to stable, albeit high, glucose levels."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Time in Range' (TIR) of 55%. According to the international consensus for most non-pregnant adults with Type 2 Diabetes, what is the target TIR percentage?",
            "options": [
                "At least 60%",
                "At least 70%",

                "At least 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The clinical gold standard for Time in Range (70-180 mg/dL) is >70%, which correlates with a significant reduction in microvascular complications."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 2, postprandial hyperglycemia was shown to impair endothelial function. Which specific mechanism is primarily responsible for this vascular damage?",
            "options": [
                "The overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron transport chain.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High glucose spikes lead to an influx of electrons into the mitochondrial transport chain, resulting in superoxide overproduction, which damages the endothelial lining."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "The STABLE Method™ Phase 1 emphasizes 'Food Sequencing.' What is the scientifically validated order for consuming meal components to flatten the glucose curve?",
            "options": [
                "Carbohydrates first, followed by fiber, then protein.",
                "Protein and fats first, followed by fiber, then carbohydrates.",
                "Fiber first, followed by protein and fats, then carbohydrates.",
                "There is no specific order as long as total calories remain the same."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consuming fiber first creates a viscous mesh in the small intestine, slowing the absorption of glucose from carbohydrates consumed at the end of the meal."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client experiences a 'crash' to 62 mg/dL. Following the '15-15 Rule' discussed in Lesson 5, what is the correct intervention?",

                "Administer 15 units of insulin and wait 15 minutes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 15-15 rule requires 15g of fast-acting (simple) carbohydrates, followed by a 15-minute wait to ensure blood sugar rises back above 70 mg/dL."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Reactive Hypoglycemia (Lesson 6) is characterized by a blood sugar drop that typically occurs how long after a high-carbohydrate meal?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reactive hypoglycemia occurs when an exaggerated insulin response to a high-carb meal causes blood sugar to plummet below baseline 2 to 4 hours post-consumption."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which inflammatory pathway is most directly activated by rapid glucose fluctuations, creating a 'vicious cycle' of insulin resistance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucose spikes activate the NF-κB pathway, which increases the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α, further worsening insulin resistance."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "According to the practical strategies in Lesson 4, how does a 10-15 minute walk post-meal affect the glucose curve?",
            "options": [
                "It increases the glucose spike by stimulating cortisol.",
                "It has no measurable effect on glucose but improves mood.",
                "It flattens the spike by activating GLUT4 translocation in muscles without requiring additional insulin.",
                "It flattens the spike by forcing the liver to store glucose as fat immediately."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction during a post-meal walk allows muscles to up-take glucose via GLUT4 transporters, reducing the amount of insulin the pancreas needs to secrete."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For many clients, a small protein/fat snack before bed prevents the liver from overproducing glucose overnight (gluconeogenesis) in response to a mild nocturnal dip."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Coefficient of Variation (%CV) of less than 36% is the clinical target for stable glucose; values above this indicate high glycemic variability."
