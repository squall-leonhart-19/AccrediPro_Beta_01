        {
            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "In the anatomy of the pancreas, which specific cells within the Islets of Langerhans are responsible for the secretion of glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia?",
            "options": ["Beta cells", "Alpha cells", "Delta cells", "F cells"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha cells secrete glucagon, which raises blood glucose levels, while Beta cells secrete insulin to lower them. Delta cells secrete somatostatin, and F cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During a prolonged fast where hepatic glycogen stores are depleted (typically after 12-24 hours), which metabolic process becomes the primary source of blood glucose?",
            "options": ["Glycogenolysis", "Glycolysis", "Gluconeogenesis", "Lipogenesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (like amino acids and glycerol) and becomes the primary driver of blood sugar maintenance once glycogen stores are exhausted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "The 'Type 3 Diabetes' hypothesis specifically refers to which pathological development?",
            "options": ["Diabetes resulting from chronic pancreatitis", "The progression of Gestational Diabetes into Type 2", "Brain-specific insulin resistance linked to Alzheimer's Disease", "Autoimmune destruction of insulin receptors in the liver"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Type 3 Diabetes is a term used to describe the link between insulin resistance in the brain and the development of Alzheimer's Disease, characterized by impaired glucose metabolism in neurons."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to the NCEP ATP III criteria, which of the following clinical findings would contribute to a diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome?",
            "options": ["Triglycerides > 100 mg/dL", "HDL Cholesterol < 40 mg/dL in men", "Fasting Glucose > 90 mg/dL", "Blood Pressure > 120/80 mmHg"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic Syndrome criteria include HDL < 40 mg/dL in men (or < 50 mg/dL in women), Triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, Fasting Glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL, and Blood Pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A client consumes a serving of watermelon which has a high Glycemic Index (GI) of 72, but only contains 5g of available carbohydrates per 100g serving. What is the calculated Glycemic Load (GL) for this serving?",
            "options": ["3.6", "7.2", "14.4", "36.0"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Glycemic Load is calculated as (GI × grams of carbs) / 100. For this example: (72 × 5) / 100 = 3.6. This demonstrates why GL is often a more useful clinical metric than GI alone."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological mechanism behind 'receptor downregulation' in chronic Type 2 Diabetes?",
            "options": ["The immune system destroys insulin receptors on the cell surface", "High circulating insulin levels cause cells to internalize and degrade insulin receptors", "A lack of dietary chromium prevents insulin from binding to the receptor", "The liver stops producing the proteins required to build insulin receptors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In states of chronic hyperinsulinemia, cells protect themselves from overstimulation by internalizing and reducing the number of active insulin receptors on the plasma membrane, leading to insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client's lab results show a Fasting Insulin of 15 µIU/mL and a Fasting Glucose of 100 mg/dL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose × Insulin / 405), what is their approximate score and clinical status?",
            "options": ["1.2 - Insulin Sensitive", "2.5 - Early Insulin Resistance", "3.7 - Significant Insulin Resistance", "5.1 - Type 2 Diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calculation: (100 × 15) / 405 = 3.7. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early resistance, and above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Which glucose transporter (GLUT) is specifically 'insulin-dependent' and requires insulin signaling to translocation from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane?",
            "options": ["GLUT1", "GLUT2", "GLUT3", "GLUT4"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "GLUT4 is the primary insulin-regulated glucose transporter found in adipose tissues and striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac)."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "HbA1c provides a weighted average of blood glucose over the previous 90-120 days. Which percentage of the HbA1c value is typically determined by the glucose levels of the previous 30 days?",
            "options": ["10%", "25%", "50%", "80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Because red blood cells are constantly being replaced, the most recent 30 days contribute approximately 50% of the total HbA1c value, while days 90-120 contribute only about 10%."

        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "In the 'Seesaw of Survival,' which hormone is secreted by the pancreas to inhibit BOTH insulin and glucagon secretion, acting as a metabolic brake?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Somatostatin", "Epinephrine", "Ghrelin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatostatin, secreted by Delta cells, acts as a paracrine inhibitor within the pancreas to modulate and dampen the secretion of both insulin and glucagon."
