            "question": "Within the STABLE methodology, what is the primary objective of the 'S' (Screen & Assess) phase?",
            "options": [
                "To begin immediate carbohydrate restriction and caloric deficit",
                "To establish a physiological baseline and identify hidden metabolic dysfunction",
                "To prescribe specific medications based on initial glucose readings",
                "To skip laboratory testing and rely solely on subjective symptoms"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Screen & Assess phase is designed to identify the 'STABLE Baseline,' using objective data (blood work, anthropometrics) and subjective data (history) to understand the client's current metabolic state before intervention."

            "options": [
                "4.5% to 5.2%",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ADA defines prediabetes as an HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4%. An HbA1c of 6.5% or higher is diagnostic for Type 2 Diabetes."

            "question": "A client has a Fasting Glucose of 98 mg/dL (normal) but a Fasting Insulin of 18 µIU/mL. Using the HOMA-IR formula (Glucose x Insulin / 405), what is their score and what does it indicate?",
            "options": [
                "HOMA-IR 1.2; Optimal insulin sensitivity",
                "HOMA-IR 2.5; Early stage glucose intolerance",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "(98 * 18) / 405 = 4.35. A HOMA-IR score above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance, even if blood glucose appears normal."

                "LDL to HDL ratio",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Triglyceride to HDL ratio (TG/HDL) greater than 3.0 (in mg/dL) is a strong predictor of insulin resistance and the presence of small, dense LDL particles."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acanthosis Nigricans is a dermatological manifestation of systemic insulin resistance; high levels of insulin spill over into skin cells, stimulating abnormal growth and pigmentation."

            "question": "When analyzing subjective history, a client reports 'nocturia' (waking up 3+ times a night to urinate). In the context of blood sugar, this is often caused by:",
            "options": [
                "The kidneys attempting to excrete excess glucose (osmotic diuresis)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "When blood glucose exceeds the renal threshold (typically ~180 mg/dL), the kidneys excrete glucose into the urine, which pulls water with it, leading to increased frequency and volume of urination (polyuria)."

                "100% of the day below 100 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "International consensus guidelines recommend a Time in Range (70–180 mg/dL) of greater than 70% to reduce the risk of long-term microvascular complications."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Why might a client's HbA1c show a 5.4% (healthy) while their CGM shows frequent spikes to 220 mg/dL after meals?",
            "options": [
                "The CGM is likely calibrated incorrectly",
                "The client has high red blood cell turnover or anemia, shortening the glycation window",
                "HbA1c only measures glucose levels during the nighttime",
                "Post-prandial spikes do not contribute to HbA1c levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HbA1c relies on the 90-120 day lifespan of a red blood cell. If a client has high RBC turnover, blood loss, or certain anemias, the glucose has less time to 'stick' to the hemoglobin, resulting in a deceptively low HbA1c."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) is a superior marker for metabolic risk. A ratio of >0.5 (waist more than half your height) is strongly correlated with visceral adiposity and insulin resistance."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "If a client presents with a high hs-CRP (High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein) level alongside elevated fasting glucose, what does this suggest to the coach?",
            "options": [
                "The client is over-hydrated",
                "The client has a high level of systemic inflammation, which can exacerbate insulin resistance",
                "The client's glucose issues are purely dietary and not related to the immune system",
                "The client has high insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "hs-CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation. Inflammation and insulin resistance are bi-directionally linked; pro-inflammatory cytokines can impair insulin signaling, making blood sugar management more difficult."
