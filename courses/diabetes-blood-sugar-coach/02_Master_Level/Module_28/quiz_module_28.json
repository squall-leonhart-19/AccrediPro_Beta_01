            "question": "A client presents with a blood glucose of 720 mg/dL, extreme dehydration, and an arterial pH of 7.35, but no significant ketones in the urine. Which metabolic emergency is most likely?",
            "options": [
                "Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)",
                "Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)",
                "Euglycemic DKA",
                "Severe Hypoglycemic Rebound"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HHS is characterized by extreme hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL) and hyperosmolality without significant ketosis or acidosis (pH usually >7.30), whereas DKA involves significant acidosis and ketone production."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "In the management of 'Brittle Diabetes,' what is the clinical threshold for the Coefficient of Variation (%CV) that indicates high glycemic variability and instability?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 20%",
                "Greater than 25%",
                "Greater than 36%",
                "Greater than 50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Coefficient of Variation (%CV) of >36% is the established international threshold used to define unstable or 'brittle' glycemic control, indicating a high risk for severe hypoglycemia."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "As Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progresses to Stage 4 or 5 (eGFR < 30 mL/min), why does the risk of hypoglycemia ironically increase for many clients on insulin?",
            "options": [
                "The kidneys produce more endogenous glucose",
                "The half-life of insulin is prolonged due to reduced renal clearance",
                "The liver increases gluconeogenesis to compensate",
                "SGLT2 inhibitors become more effective at lower eGFR levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The kidneys are responsible for clearing about 30-80% of exogenous insulin. As renal function declines, insulin remains in the system longer, necessitating significant dose reductions to prevent hypoglycemia."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "According to the 2023 ADA Standards of Care, what is the recommended HbA1c target for most pregnant women with pre-existing Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, if achievable without significant hypoglycemia?",
            "options": [
                "Less than 5.5%",

                "Less than 7.0%",
                "Less than 8.0%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to increased red blood cell turnover and the need for tight control to prevent fetal macrosomia and preeclampsia, the target HbA1c in pregnancy is ideally <6.0%."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A 22-year-old female client with T1DM presents with an HbA1c of 11.4%, rapid weight loss, and frequent episodes of 'unexplained' DKA. She expresses extreme fear of weight gain. What is the most likely dual diagnosis?",

                "Orthorexia"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T1ED (Type 1 Diabetes and Eating Disorder), colloquially known as diabulimia, often involves the deliberate omission of insulin to induce glycosuria and rapid weight loss, leading to dangerously high HbA1c and recurrent DKA."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "Which class of common medications is most notorious for causing severe postprandial hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, often requiring a 20-50% increase in insulin doses?",
            "options": [
                "Statins",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glucocorticoids (like prednisone) significantly increase hepatic glucose production and muscle insulin resistance, typically causing a massive spike in blood sugar 4-8 hours after administration."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In geriatric care for a frail 85-year-old client with multiple comorbidities and a limited life expectancy, what is the primary goal of glycemic management?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In frail elderly or palliative patients, the focus shifts from preventing long-term complications (which take 10-20 years to manifest) to avoiding immediate harms like hypoglycemia and dehydration."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "During a coaching session, a client reports nausea, abdominal pain, and a 'fruity' breath odor. Their CGM shows 280 mg/dL. What is the coach's immediate 'Crisis Leadership' action?",
            "options": [
                "Suggest a 2-unit insulin bolus and recheck in 2 hours",
                "Advise the client to perform vigorous exercise to lower the glucose",

                "Recommend a high-fiber snack and increased water intake"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and fruity breath are 'red flags' for DKA. A coach must never attempt to manage a metabolic emergency; immediate referral to the ER is mandatory."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "Based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, which class of medication has shown a significant reduction in the risk of Cardiovascular Death and Heart Failure hospitalization in complex T2DM cases?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SGLT2 inhibitors (like Empagliflozin) have demonstrated robust cardiovascular and renal protective benefits, making them first-line therapy for clients with T2DM and CVD or CKD."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "When conceptualizing a complex case involving both CVD and Stage 3 CKD, which factor is the most critical 'Systemic Constraint' to consider first in the coaching plan?",
            "options": [
                "The client's preference for organic foods",
                "The potential for fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
