            "options": [
                "Aggressive weight loss through caloric restriction",
                "Reducing glycemic variability and dampening post-prandial excursions",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Stabilization phase focuses on 'smoothing the curve' by reducing glycemic variability (MAGE), which is a stronger predictor of oxidative stress than HbA1c alone."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-insulin-mediated glucose uptake (NIMGU) can persist for up to 48 hours as the body works to replenish glycogen stores, significantly improving insulin sensitivity."
