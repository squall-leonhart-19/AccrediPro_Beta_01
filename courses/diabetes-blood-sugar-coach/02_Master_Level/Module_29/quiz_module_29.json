            "question": "When synthesizing the S.T.A.B.L.E. Method™ for a complex case involving both Type 2 Diabetes and Stage 2 Hypertension, which 'S' (Stress) intervention is prioritized to prevent the 'Dawn Phenomenon'?",
            "options": [
                "Implementing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at 6:00 PM",
                "Optimizing sleep hygiene to reduce nocturnal cortisol surges",
                "Increasing sodium intake to stabilize blood pressure during sleep",
                "Strict caloric restriction starting after 4:00 PM"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In complex cases, nocturnal cortisol surges are a primary driver of the Dawn Phenomenon. Optimizing sleep hygiene (Stress/Environment) reduces the hepatic glucose output triggered by early morning cortisol spikes."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "In the context of 'Advanced Biometric Triangulation,' what does a declining Heart Rate Variability (HRV) trend alongside a stable 7-day CGM average (GMI) usually signify?",
            "options": [
                "The client has reached optimal metabolic flexibility",
                "The client's insulin sensitivity is improving rapidly",
                "Systemic 'Allostatic Load' is increasing, indicating a risk of future glucose volatility",
                "The CGM sensor is likely malfunctioning and needs replacement"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV serves as a leading indicator. A declining trend suggests the autonomic nervous system is under stress (Allostatic Load), which often precedes a breakdown in glycemic control even if current glucose readings appear stable."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Lesson 3 discusses 'Metabolic Complexity.' Why must a Master Practitioner exercise caution when interpreting HbA1c in a client with advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)?",
            "options": [
                "CKD causes glucose to bind more tightly to hemoglobin",
                "Reduced red blood cell lifespan in CKD often leads to a falsely low HbA1c",
                "CKD patients always have higher HbA1c regardless of diet",
                "HbA1c cannot be measured in the presence of proteinuria"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In CKD, factors like anemia and shortened red blood cell survival can lead to HbA1c readings that underestimate the client's actual average blood glucose levels, necessitating the use of CGM data for accuracy."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Psychosocial Mastery, what is the 'Diabetes Distress' prevalence rate among insulin-using Type 2 patients, and how does it impact the S.T.A.B.L.E. Method™?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 10%; it has minimal impact on physiological outcomes",
                "Approximately 45%; it creates a 'behavioral paralysis' that prevents 'A' (Activity) adherence",
                "Exactly 75%; it requires immediate psychiatric hospitalization",
                "Less than 5%; it is largely a myth in modern coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates nearly 45% of patients experience significant diabetes distress, which manifests as emotional exhaustion and prevents them from engaging in the behavioral components (like Activity or Timing) of the S.T.A.B.L.E. Method™."

        {
            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "When collaborating with a client's medical team (Lesson 5), which document is most effective for a Coach to provide the physician to advocate for a medication review?",
            "options": [
                "A 3-day food log with subjective energy ratings",
                "A 'Triangulation Report' showing the correlation between specific 'T' (Timing) shifts and hypoglycemic events",
                "A list of recommended herbal supplements for the doctor to approve",
                "A testimonial from another client with a similar condition"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical advocacy is most effective when providing objective, data-driven reports that correlate specific lifestyle variables (Timing) with glycemic outcomes (CGM data), allowing the physician to make informed dosage adjustments."

        {
            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6 (Metabolic Resilience), a 'regression' is defined as a return to old patterns. What is the recommended 'Master Practitioner' response to a client's 2-week lapse in 'B' (Blood Sugar Monitoring)?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate termination of the coaching contract",
                "Increasing the intensity of the 'A' (Activity) protocol to compensate",
                "A 'Root Cause Inquiry' to identify the psychosocial barrier that triggered the lapse",
                "Ignoring the lapse to avoid shaming the client"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regressions are data points. A Master Practitioner uses a 'Root Cause Inquiry' to determine if the lapse was due to burnout, distress, or environmental changes, rather than simply focusing on the lack of data."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "Scaling the S.T.A.B.L.E. Method™ (Lesson 7) highlights that group dynamics can improve outcomes. What specific statistical benefit was noted for group-based metabolic interventions?",
            "options": [
                "A 0.5% to 1.0% additional reduction in HbA1c compared to individual care",
                "A 100% elimination of the need for Metformin",
                "Group participants require 50% less protein in their diet",
                "There is no statistical difference between group and individual coaching"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses of group-based diabetes education and support show an additional 0.5% to 1.0% reduction in HbA1c, likely due to social support and collective problem-solving."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "A client presents with a 'Metabolic Stall' where weight and glucose have plateaued despite 100% adherence. Which intervention from Lesson 6 is most appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Decreasing caloric intake by another 500 calories",
                "Implementing a 'Metabolic Reset' phase with increased 'S' (Stress management) and maintenance calories",
                "Switching the client to a carnivore-only diet immediately",
                "Increasing the frequency of glucose testing to 20 times per day"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stalls are often the result of metabolic adaptation. A 'Metabolic Reset' focuses on downregulating the stress response and providing adequate energy to signal safety to the endocrine system, breaking the plateau."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Master Practitioner’s Legacy' (Lesson 8) regarding client 'Metabolic Autonomy'?",
            "options": [
                "Ensuring the client remains dependent on the coach for life",
                "Teaching the client to interpret their own 'Biometric Triangulation' to make real-time adjustments",
                "Having the client recruit five new members to the coaching program",
                "Moving the client to a supplement-only protocol"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability is achieved when a client moves from 'Coach-led' to 'Self-led' (Metabolic Autonomy), where they can independently use the S.T.A.B.L.E. framework and their own data to navigate life's variables."

        {
            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "During a 'Biometric Triangulation' analysis, you notice a client’s glucose spikes only on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. You find they attend a high-stress 8:00 AM meeting those days. This is an example of integrating which two S.T.A.B.L.E. variables?",
            "options": [
                "Activity and Blood Sugar Monitoring",
                "Stress and Timing",
                "Environment and Activity",
                "Supplements and Blood Sugar Monitoring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This identifies the intersection of 'Stress' (the meeting) and 'Timing' (the specific mornings), demonstrating how external psychosocial factors directly drive glycemic variability."
