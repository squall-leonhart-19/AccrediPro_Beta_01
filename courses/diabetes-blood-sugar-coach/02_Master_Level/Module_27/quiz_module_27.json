            "question": "Sarah, a Type 1 Diabetic (T1D) client, experiences severe hypoglycemia approximately 10 hours after a high-intensity resistance training session. What is the most likely physiological cause?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate depletion of circulating blood glucose during the workout",
                "Delayed-onset hypoglycemia due to nocturnal glycogen replenishment and increased GLUT4 sensitivity",
                "Excessive glucagon secretion triggered by anaerobic glycolysis",
                "A failure of the 'Honeymoon Phase' beta-cell regeneration"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance training increases insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 translocation for up to 24 hours. The 'lag effect' often occurs 7-11 hours post-exercise as the body moves glucose from the blood into the muscles to replenish glycogen stores."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "Research indicates that insulin resistance (IR) is a core feature of PCOS. What percentage of women with PCOS exhibit IR, regardless of their Body Mass Index (BMI)?",
            "options": [
                "25-35%",
                "50-60%",
                "70-80%",
                "95-100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Stepto et al., 2013) show that approximately 75% of lean women and 95% of overweight women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance, making it a nearly universal feature of the condition."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A client who had Gestational Diabetes (GDM) is now 8 weeks postpartum. According to clinical guidelines, what is the mandatory screening requirement to assess metabolic recovery?",
            "options": [
                "A single fasting plasma glucose test immediately after delivery",
                "A 75g 2-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at 6-12 weeks postpartum",
                "An HbA1c test 1 week after discharge",
                "No screening is required if the baby was born at a normal weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Because women with a history of GDM have a 10-fold increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, a 75g OGTT is required between 6 and 12 weeks postpartum to identify persistent glucose intolerance."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "The 'Athlete's Paradox' refers to which metabolic phenomenon observed in high-performance endurance athletes?",
            "options": [
                "High levels of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) paired with high insulin sensitivity",
                "Low glycogen stores despite high carbohydrate intake",
                "High resting blood glucose levels despite low body fat",
                "Increased insulin resistance due to excessive caloric consumption"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Athlete's Paradox describes how trained athletes have high levels of fat stored within muscle cells (IMCL), which is usually a marker of IR in sedentary individuals, yet they remain highly insulin sensitive because they use that fat efficiently for fuel."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "In geriatric populations, 'Type 3 Diabetes' is an emerging term used to describe which specific pathological process?",

                "Diabetes caused exclusively by the loss of muscle mass (Sarcopenia)",
                "A form of diabetes that only responds to injectable medications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type 3 Diabetes refers to the hypothesis that Alzheimer's is a metabolic disease characterized by brain-specific insulin resistance and IGF-1 deficiency, leading to cognitive decline."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "Shift workers have a 40% higher risk of metabolic syndrome. What is the primary hormonal mechanism behind 'night-shift glucose intolerance'?",
            "options": [
                "Cortisol levels drop too low during the night shift",
                "Melatonin, which peaks at night, binds to MT1 receptors and acutely inhibits insulin secretion",
                "The liver stops producing glucose entirely during the biological night",
                "Vitamin D deficiency from lack of sunlight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Melatonin and insulin have an inverse relationship. When shift workers eat during their biological night (when melatonin is high), melatonin inhibits the pancreas from secreting enough insulin, leading to exaggerated postprandial glucose spikes."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A client who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 12 months ago reports 'shakiness, sweating, and confusion' about 2 hours after eating a bowl of white rice. What is the most likely clinical explanation?",
            "options": [
                "Early Dumping Syndrome caused by osmotic fluid shifts",

                "Bacterial overgrowth in the bypassed section of the intestine",
                "Normal recovery from surgery"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Late Dumping Syndrome occurs 1-3 hours after a high-glycemic meal. The rapid entry of glucose into the small intestine causes a massive surge in GLP-1 and insulin, which subsequently drops blood sugar to dangerously low levels."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "During puberty, what physiological change in insulin dynamics is considered 'normal,' and why is it significant for pediatric metabolic coaching?",
            "options": [
                "Insulin sensitivity increases by 50% to allow for rapid growth",
                "Insulin sensitivity transiently decreases by 30-50%, increasing the risk of metabolic 'crossover' in overweight children",
                "The pancreas stops producing insulin for 6 months during the peak growth spurt",
                "HbA1c naturally rises to 7.0% during puberty"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Puberty induces a physiological, transient state of insulin resistance (a 30-50% drop in sensitivity). In children already struggling with obesity, this can 'tip the scales' toward clinical Type 2 Diabetes."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Which nutritional supplement ratio has been clinically shown to be most effective for restoring ovulation and improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS patients?",
            "options": [
                "1:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to Magnesium",
                "40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol",
                "10:1 ratio of Berberine to Inositol",
                "5:1 ratio of Omega-3 to Vitamin D"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol mimics the physiological plasma ratio and has been shown in multiple meta-analyses to be superior for metabolic and reproductive outcomes in PCOS."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "To combat Sarcopenic Obesity in elderly diabetic clients, what is the recommended protein intake threshold to maintain muscle mass and support glucose disposal?",

                "0.6 g/kg of body weight",
                "0.8 g/kg of body weight",
                "1.2 - 1.5 g/kg of body weight",
                "3.0 - 4.0 g/kg of body weight"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to 'anabolic resistance' in the elderly, higher protein intakes (1.2-1.5 g/kg) are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and maintain the muscle mass necessary for glucose disposal."
