            "question": "When interpreting Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data, a Coefficient of Variation (CV) above which threshold is the clinical gold standard for identifying 'unstable' glycemic variability?",
            "options": [
                "20%",
                "28%",
                "36%",
                "42%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "International consensus guidelines state that a CV of 36% or higher indicates unstable glycemic control and high glycemic variability, which is a stronger predictor of complications than A1c alone."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "The 'Neuro-Metabolic Axis' relies on glucose-sensing neurons located primarily in which area of the hypothalamus to regulate systemic energy balance?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Arcuate Nucleus (ARC) contains specialized POMC and AgRP neurons that sense circulating glucose and hormones to coordinate metabolic responses and appetite."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client undergoes indirect calorimetry and shows a Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) of 0.72 while in a fasted state. What does this signify regarding their metabolic flexibility?",
            "options": [
                "They are primarily burning carbohydrates and lack flexibility.",
                "They are in a state of metabolic crisis.",
                "They demonstrate high metabolic flexibility by efficiently oxidizing fatty acids.",
                "Their protein oxidation is dangerously high."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An RER of 0.70 to 0.75 in a fasted state indicates that the body has successfully shifted to fat oxidation, a hallmark of metabolic flexibility."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "In the context of Nutrigenomics and the S.T.A.B.L.E. protocol, a client with the 'TT' risk genotype of the TCF7L2 gene is likely to experience which clinical outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Superior weight loss on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.",
                "Impaired GLP-1 secretion and a higher risk of failure on standard low-fat interventions.",
                "Total immunity to the effects of saturated fats.",
                "Enhanced insulin sensitivity regardless of exercise levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The TCF7L2 polymorphism is associated with impaired insulin secretion and reduced GLP-1 levels, often requiring more aggressive carbohydrate management than the general population."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "Which behavioral psychology technique involves creating 'If-Then' plans to automate responses to triggers, potentially doubling the rate of goal attainment in chronic disease management?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementation Intentions (If-Then planning) bridge the 'intention-behavior gap' by creating pre-determined responses to specific cues, significantly improving adherence in diabetic populations."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A Master Practitioner must be aware that clients taking SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., Canagliflozin) are at an increased risk for which rare but serious condition when adopting a ketogenic diet?",
            "options": [
                "Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State",
                "Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis (EDKA)",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SGLT2 inhibitors can cause the body to continue excreting glucose in the urine even during ketosis, leading to ketoacidosis with relatively normal blood sugar levels (Euglycemic DKA)."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "For an insulin-resistant athlete, what is the primary mechanism by which intense muscle contraction improves glucose uptake during a workout?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction stimulates GLUT4 transporters to move to the cell surface via the AMPK pathway, bypassing the need for insulin to clear glucose from the blood."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "A client's CGM shows a 'Somogyi Effect.' How does this differ from the 'Dawn Phenomenon'?",
            "options": [
                "Somogyi involves a rise in blood sugar due to growth hormone, while Dawn involves cortisol.",
                "Somogyi is caused by nocturnal hypoglycemia followed by a rebound rise, whereas Dawn is a rise without preceding hypoglycemia.",
                "Somogyi only happens in Type 2 Diabetes, while Dawn only happens in Type 1.",
                "There is no difference; they are interchangeable terms."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somogyi Effect is a rebound hyperglycemia triggered by the body's counter-regulatory response to a 'dip' (hypoglycemia) in the middle of the night."

            "id": "q24_9",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PGC-1alpha (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) is the central regulator that drives the creation of new mitochondria and improves fat oxidation."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "According to Ethical Leadership standards for Master Practitioners, what is the correct protocol when a client's glucose data suggests their medication dosage may be too high?",
            "options": [
                "Instruct the client to cut their dose in half immediately.",
                "Suggest the client stop the medication for three days to 'test' the response.",
                "Provide the client with a structured data report and advise them to consult their prescribing physician for a dose review.",
                "Change the client's S.T.A.B.L.E. protocol to include more sugar to balance the medication."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never adjust or advise on medication dosages. The ethical boundary is to provide the data and facilitate the conversation between the client and their medical provider."
