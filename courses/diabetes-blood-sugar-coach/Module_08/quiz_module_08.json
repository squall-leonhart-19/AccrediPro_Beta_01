            "question": "Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) contribute to vascular damage primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Binding to RAGE receptors and triggering pro-inflammatory signaling",
                "Increasing the production of insulin in the pancreas",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "AGEs bind to the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), which activates NF-κB, leading to oxidative stress and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that damage vascular tissues."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The enzyme aldose reductase converts glucose into sorbitol. Because sorbitol does not easily cross cell membranes, it accumulates, causing osmotic stress that contributes to diabetic neuropathy."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'first hit' is the accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis), often caused by insulin resistance. The 'second hit' involves oxidative stress or inflammation that progresses steatosis to NASH."

            "id": "q8_6",
