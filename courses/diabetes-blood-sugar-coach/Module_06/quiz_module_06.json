            "question": "According to the STABLE Method™, how does a single night of partial sleep deprivation (4 hours) impact metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "It has negligible effects if the person is young and healthy",
                "It can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by up to 25% the following day",
                "It primarily affects fat oxidation but leaves glucose metabolism untouched",
                "It increases insulin sensitivity as a compensatory survival mechanism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (Donga et al., 2010) demonstrates that just one night of partial sleep deprivation induces significant insulin resistance in multiple metabolic pathways, comparable to the effects of several weeks of a high-fat diet."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which blue light exposure at night disrupts glucose regulation?",
            "options": [
                "It causes immediate destruction of pancreatic alpha cells",
                "It suppresses melatonin, which normally binds to MT1/MT2 receptors on beta cells to regulate insulin secretion",
                "It increases the absorption rate of glucose in the small intestine",
                "It triggers an immediate release of glucagon from the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light suppresses the pineal gland's production of melatonin. Melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) are located on pancreatic beta cells; their activation is crucial for the nocturnal 'rest' of the pancreas and proper glucose timing."

        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "In the context of chronic stress, what does the 'Sticky Blood' effect refer to?",
            "options": [
                "Increased dietary sugar sticking to red blood cells (HbA1c)",
                "Elevated levels of fibrinogen and PAI-1, increasing blood viscosity and cardiovascular risk",
                "A rare condition where insulin molecules adhere to the arterial walls",
                "The sensation of lethargy following a high-cortisol event"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress activates the HPA axis, increasing cortisol which stimulates the production of fibrinogen and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This increases blood viscosity (making it 'sticky') and reduces fibrinolysis, raising the risk of clots and microvascular damage."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) acts as the 'Master Clock.' Where are the 'Peripheral Clocks' primarily located that influence the STABLE Method™ protocols?",
            "options": [
                "Only in the eyes and skin",
                "Exclusively in the brain's pituitary gland",
                "In almost every tissue, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue",
                "Only in the gut microbiome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the SCN coordinates the system, peripheral clocks exist in nearly all tissues. The clocks in the liver, muscle, and pancreas are particularly important for blood sugar coaching as they dictate when these organs are most sensitive to insulin."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) techniques, such as deep diaphragmatic breathing, help lower blood sugar by:",
            "options": [
                "Increasing sympathetic 'Fight or Flight' activity",
                "Directly burning calories through respiratory effort",
                "Activating the parasympathetic nervous system to improve insulin signaling and gut motility",
                "Reducing the amount of oxygen in the blood"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus nerve is the primary component of the parasympathetic nervous system. Stimulation improves the 'Rest and Digest' state, which facilitates efficient insulin secretion and reduces the hepatic glucose output triggered by stress."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Which endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) is specifically noted for mimicking estrogen and interfering with PPARγ signaling, potentially leading to 'obesogen' effects?",
            "options": [
                "Sodium Chloride",
                "Bisphenol A (BPA)",
                "Vitamin D3",
                "Magnesium Sulfate"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "BPA is a well-studied EDC found in plastics and receipts. It interferes with hormonal signaling, promotes adipogenesis (fat cell creation), and is linked to increased insulin resistance even at low 'safe' doses."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "How does chronic dehydration contribute to elevated fasting blood glucose levels?",
            "options": [
                "It causes the kidneys to produce more glucose",
                "It triggers the release of vasopressin (ADH), which stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver",
                "It makes the insulin molecules too large to enter cells",
                "Dehydration has no effect on blood glucose"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low water intake triggers vasopressin. Beyond water retention, vasopressin acts on V1a receptors in the liver to stimulate the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, raising blood sugar levels independently of food intake."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Dawn Phenomenon' (high morning glucose). According to Phase 5 protocols, what is a recommended lifestyle intervention?",
            "options": [
                "Eat a high-carb snack at 11:00 PM to 'prime' the pump",
                "Perform high-intensity interval training (HIIT) immediately before bed",
                "Implement a 'Digital Sunset' 2 hours before bed and ensure total darkness during sleep",
                "Increase caffeine intake in the evening to boost metabolism"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'Digital Sunset' reduces blue light exposure, allowing for natural melatonin rise and lower overnight cortisol. This helps mitigate the exaggerated cortisol spike in the morning that contributes to the Dawn Phenomenon."

        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "What is the significance of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in blood sugar coaching?",
            "options": [
                "It measures the exact amount of glucose in the interstitial fluid",
                "It is a proxy measurement for autonomic nervous system balance and Vagal tone",
                "It determines the client's maximum heart rate for exercise",
                "It is used to calculate the glycemic load of a meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats. Higher HRV generally indicates better Vagal tone and a more resilient parasympathetic nervous system, which correlates with better glucose regulation and stress recovery."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Based on Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) research, when is insulin sensitivity typically at its highest?",
            "options": [
                "Between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM",
                "In the morning and early afternoon",
                "Immediately after a high-protein dinner",
                "Sensitivity is constant throughout the 24-hour cycle"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Circadian biology dictates that insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food are highest in the morning. As the day progresses toward the biological night, the body naturally becomes more insulin resistant."
