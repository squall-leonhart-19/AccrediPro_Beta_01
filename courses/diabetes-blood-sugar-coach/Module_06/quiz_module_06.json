            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "According to Self-Determination Theory (SDT) discussed in Lesson 1, which psychological need is most critical for a client to transition from extrinsic 'compliance' to intrinsic 'ownership' of their metabolic health?",
            "options": [
                "External validation from the coach",
                "Autonomy: The feeling of being the origin of one's own behavior",
                "Strict adherence to a pre-defined meal plan",
                "Fear-based motivation regarding long-term complications"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autonomy is the cornerstone of intrinsic motivation. When a client feels they are the 'author' of their choices rather than following a coach's orders, long-term metabolic stability becomes significantly more sustainable."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In Behavioral Architecture (Lesson 2), the concept of 'Friction' is used to influence habits. Which of the following is an example of increasing friction for a 'maladaptive' habit?",
            "options": [
                "Placing pre-cut vegetables at eye level in the refrigerator",
                "Setting out workout clothes the night before",
                "Storing ultra-processed snack foods in an opaque container on a high, hard-to-reach shelf",
                "Automating a grocery delivery of healthy staples"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increasing friction means making a negative habit harder to perform. Placing snacks in hard-to-reach, non-visible locations adds physical and cognitive steps, reducing the likelihood of impulsive consumption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "When navigating high-risk social environments (Lesson 3), what is the primary purpose of the 'Pre-Game' strategy?",
            "options": [
                "To eat a full meal before the event so no food is consumed there",
                "To stabilize blood sugar and reduce 'hunger-driven' impulsivity through a high-protein/fiber snack",
                "To announce to the entire group that you are on a strict diet",
                "To avoid the social event entirely to prevent a relapse"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Pre-Game' strategy involves consuming a small, blood-sugar-stabilizing snack (protein/fiber) to ensure the client arrives with stable glucose, preventing the physiological 'hunger-panic' that leads to poor choices in social settings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "In advanced data analysis (Lesson 4), what is the clinical significance of a Coefficient of Variation (CV) below 36%?",
            "options": [
                "It indicates the client is at high risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia",
                "It is the international consensus target for 'stable' glucose variability",
                "It means the client's A1c is guaranteed to be below 6.0%",
                "It suggests the client is not eating enough carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Coefficient of Variation (CV) measures glycemic variability. A CV < 36% is the clinical threshold for stable glucose; higher percentages indicate 'swinging' blood sugar, which is a greater predictor of complications than A1c alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "The 'Abstinence Violation Effect' (AVE), discussed in Lesson 5, often leads to which counterproductive behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Immediate corrective action after a small slip",
                "An 'all-or-nothing' spiral where a single lapse leads to a total collapse of the protocol",
                "Increased motivation to exercise the following day",
                "More frequent blood sugar monitoring"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "AVE occurs when a client views a single lapse as a total failure of their identity or program, leading to the 'What the Hell' effect where they continue to make poor choices because they feel the 'streak' is broken."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "As a coach shifts from 'Guide' to 'Consultant' (Lesson 6), how should their communication style change during sessions?",
            "options": [
                "The coach should provide more direct instructions and meal plans",
                "The coach should speak for 80% of the session to ensure all data is covered",
                "The coach should use more 'Reflective Listening' and allow the client to lead the problem-solving process",
                "The coach should set the client's weekly goals without their input"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Consultant phase is about fostering autonomy. The coach moves into a supportive role where they reflect the client's insights back to them, allowing the client to develop their own solutions and mastery."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "Lesson 8 addresses 'Future-Proofing' for aging. Why is the prevention of sarcopenia (muscle loss) a primary metabolic priority for clients over age 60?",
            "options": [
                "Muscle tissue is the largest 'sink' for glucose disposal in the body",
                "Muscle loss prevents the absorption of Vitamin D",
                "Sarcopenia causes an immediate increase in dietary fat absorption",
                "Aging clients no longer require insulin if they have high muscle mass"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle is the primary site for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. As clients age, maintaining muscle mass is critical for maintaining insulin sensitivity and preventing type 2 diabetes progression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "According to the International Consensus on Time in Range (TIR) discussed in Lesson 4, what is the standard target percentage for TIR (70-180 mg/dL) for most non-pregnant adults?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 50%",
                "Greater than 70%",
                "Greater than 95%",
                "Exactly 100%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The clinical target for most adults with diabetes is to spend >70% of the day within the range of 70-180 mg/dL, which correlates strongly with a reduction in microvascular complications."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In the 'Bounce Back' Protocol (Lesson 5), what is the recommended timeframe for a client to perform a 'Pattern Analysis' after a significant metabolic lapse?",
            "options": [
                "Within 1 hour of the lapse",
                "Within 24-48 hours, once physiological stability is regained",
                "One month after the lapse occurred",
                "Only if the lapse lasts for more than a week"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Analysis should happen within 24-48 hours. This is close enough to the event for accurate recall, but allows enough time for the 'emotional' brain to calm down and the 'logical' brain to take over."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Lesson 7 discusses 'Social Contagion.' How can a coach leverage this phenomenon to improve a client's long-term success?",
            "options": [
                "By isolating the client from all friends who eat poorly",
                "By encouraging the client to join or create a community of peers with similar health goals",
                "By telling the client to ignore the behaviors of their spouse",
                "By providing the client with a list of celebrities who have diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social Contagion suggests that behaviors (both healthy and unhealthy) spread through networks. By embedding a client in a health-conscious community, the 'norm' shifts toward metabolic health, making maintenance easier."
