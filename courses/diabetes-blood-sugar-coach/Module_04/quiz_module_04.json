            "question": "During muscle contraction, how does the GLUT4 transporter reach the cell membrane to facilitate glucose uptake without the need for insulin?",
            "options": [
                "Via the stimulation of the PI3K pathway through IGF-1 receptors",
                "Through the activation of the AMPK pathway triggered by an increased AMP:ATP ratio",
                "By the direct binding of glucose molecules to the sarcoplasmic reticulum",
                "Through the suppression of cortisol and glucagon during aerobic activity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction increases the AMP:ATP ratio, which activates Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). This pathway triggers GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane independently of the insulin-signaling (PI3K) pathway."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A 2016 study published in Diabetologia compared a single 30-minute daily walk to three 10-minute post-meal walks. What was the finding regarding postprandial glucose levels?",
            "options": [
                "The single 30-minute walk was 5% more effective at lowering morning fasting glucose",
                "There was no statistically significant difference between the two protocols",
                "Post-meal walking was 12% more effective at lowering blood sugar than a single bout",
                "Walking immediately before a meal was superior to walking after a meal"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study found that 10-minute walks taken after each meal were significantly more effective—averaging a 12% greater reduction in postprandial glucose—compared to a single 30-minute walk per day."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Skeletal muscle is responsible for approximately what percentage of insulin-mediated glucose disposal in the postprandial state?",
            "options": [
                "Approximately 80%",
                "Less than 40%",
                "Exactly 50%",
                "Approximately 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle is the primary site for glucose disposal, accounting for roughly 80% of glucose uptake following a meal. This highlights why sarcopenia (muscle loss) is a major risk factor for insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Why is High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) specifically effective for 'metabolic clearing' in Type 2 Diabetes clients?",
            "options": [
                "It primarily burns adipose tissue during the active intervals",
                "It reduces the heart rate variability, allowing for better insulin signaling",
                "It causes rapid glycogen depletion, creating a massive 'sink' for subsequent glucose storage",
                "It lowers blood pressure, which indirectly increases insulin sensitivity"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HIIT utilizes high-intensity bursts that rapidly deplete muscle glycogen. This creates a physiological demand (a 'sink') that forces the body to prioritize glucose disposal to replenish those stores for up to 24-48 hours."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the impact of NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) on blood sugar management?",
            "options": [
                "NEAT is only relevant for weight loss and has no impact on GLUT4",
                "Low NEAT levels are associated with 'sitting disease' and suppressed LPL activity",
                "NEAT must be performed at 60% of VO2 max to influence insulin sensitivity",
                "NEAT refers specifically to structured resistance training sessions"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "NEAT includes all movement that isn't structured exercise. Low NEAT (prolonged sitting) suppresses Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) activity and reduces the frequency of non-insulin mediated glucose uptake, contributing to metabolic dysfunction."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "When working with a Type 1 Diabetic client, why might you observe a temporary *increase* in blood glucose during a heavy resistance training session or a sprint?",
            "options": [
                "The release of catecholamines (adrenaline/noradrenaline) stimulates hepatic glucose production",
                "The muscle is unable to use GLUT4 transporters during anaerobic work",
                "Resistance training causes an immediate shutdown of the pancreas",
                "The client is likely experiencing the 'Somogyi Effect' mid-workout"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-intensity anaerobic exercise triggers a stress response, releasing catecholamines. These hormones signal the liver to release stored glucose (glycogenolysis) faster than the muscles can use it, leading to a temporary rise in blood sugar."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "The 'Lag Effect' of exercise-induced hypoglycemia refers to a drop in blood sugar that typically occurs how many hours after a workout?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately (within 15 minutes)",
                "1 to 2 hours post-exercise",
                "6 to 15 hours post-exercise",
                "Exactly 24 hours post-exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Lag Effect' or delayed onset hypoglycemia often occurs 6-15 hours after exercise as the body continues to pull glucose from the blood to replenish muscle glycogen stores, often occurring overnight."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "In the STABLE Method™, Phase 3 (Active Sensitization) focuses on which primary physiological goal?",
            "options": [
                "Restoring the gut microbiome through fermented foods",
                "Aggressive caloric restriction to induce rapid weight loss",
                "Upregulating GLUT4 expression and increasing mitochondrial density",
                "Eliminating all carbohydrates to prevent insulin spikes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 3: Active Sensitization focuses on using movement to improve the body's ability to handle glucose by increasing the number of GLUT4 transporters and improving mitochondrial efficiency."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "According to the '10-Minute Rule' for post-meal walking, what is the optimal window to begin the walk to catch the glucose peak?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately after the first bite of food",
                "Within 20–30 minutes after finishing the meal",
                "Two hours after the meal is completely digested",
                "Only after blood sugar has already returned to baseline"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To most effectively blunt the postprandial spike, movement should ideally begin within 20-30 minutes after finishing a meal, coinciding with the early stages of glucose absorption into the bloodstream."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client presents with 'Sarcopenic Obesity.' Why is resistance training prioritized over steady-state cardio in their STABLE Method™ plan?",
            "options": [
                "Cardio is dangerous for individuals with high body fat percentages",
                "Resistance training is the only way to activate the AMPK pathway",
                "Increasing muscle mass increases the total volume of the 'glucose sink,' improving long-term basal metabolic rate",
                "Resistance training prevents the absorption of dietary fats in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In sarcopenic obesity, the client has low muscle mass and high fat mass. Resistance training is prioritized to build the 'glucose sink' (muscle tissue), which provides more surface area for GLUT4 translocation and improves glucose disposal capacity."
