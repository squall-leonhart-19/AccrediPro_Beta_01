            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which hormone acts as the primary counter-regulatory agent to insulin by stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and contributing to the 'Dawn Phenomenon'?",
            "options": [
                "Adiponectin",
                "Cortisol",
                "Ghrelin",
                "Melatonin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol is a glucocorticoid that increases blood glucose by stimulating gluconeogenesis in the liver and antagonizing the effects of insulin, particularly in the early morning hours (Dawn Phenomenon)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "In healthy individuals, the 'Incretin Effect' is responsible for what percentage of the total insulin response following oral glucose ingestion?",
            "options": [
                "10-20%",

                "Over 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In healthy individuals, gut-derived incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) account for approximately 50-70% of the total insulin secreted after a meal, a response that is significantly diminished in Type 2 diabetics."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A client consistently sleeping less than 5 hours per night is likely to experience which hormonal shift in the Hunger-Satiety Axis?",
            "options": [
                "Increased Leptin and Decreased Ghrelin",
                "Decreased Leptin and Increased Ghrelin",

                "Decreased Glucagon and Increased GLP-1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation leads to a decrease in the satiety hormone leptin and an increase in the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin, typically resulting in increased caloric intake and weight gain."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Unlike most adipokines, Adiponectin levels display which specific relationship with body fat mass?",
            "options": [
                "A positive correlation (higher fat = higher adiponectin)",
                "No correlation at all",
                "An inverse correlation (higher fat = lower adiponectin)",
                "A bell-curve correlation peaking at 25% body fat"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adiponectin is unique because its levels decrease as visceral adiposity increases. Lower levels of adiponectin are associated with increased insulin resistance and systemic inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",

                "T3 (Triiodothyronine)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "T3 is the metabolically active thyroid hormone that enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing the expression of GLUT4 glucose transporters and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, why do many women experience a temporary decrease in insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Estrogen levels are at their lowest",
                "Progesterone levels rise, antagonizing insulin action",
                "Testosterone levels peak, causing muscle resistance",
                "Adrenaline production increases to prepare for menstruation"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rise in progesterone during the luteal phase is associated with increased insulin resistance, often requiring adjustments in medication or lifestyle for women with diabetes."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "The term 'Allostatic Load' in metabolic health refers to:",

                "The ratio of insulin to glucagon in the fasting state"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allostatic load represents the 'price the body pays' for being forced to adapt to adverse psychosocial or physical situations, which eventually leads to the breakdown of glycemic control."

                "Breaking down muscle tissue, increasing heart rate, and lowering blood pressure"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 is an incretin that enhances insulin secretion only when glucose is present, suppresses postprandial glucagon, and slows the rate at which food leaves the stomach."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the action of the native GLP-1 hormone, which is secreted by the L-cells in the ileum and colon in response to nutrient intake."
