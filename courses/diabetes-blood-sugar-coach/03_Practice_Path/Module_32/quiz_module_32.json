            "question": "To avoid the 'unauthorized practice of medicine' as a Diabetes & Blood Sugar Coach, which of the following is the most critical legal distinction in your client agreements?",
            "options": [
                "Providing medical nutrition therapy (MNT) instead of general nutrition education.",
                "Explicitly stating that the service is educational and supportive, not diagnostic or prescriptive.",

                "Ensuring that the coach holds a personal trainer certification in addition to coaching."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lesson 2 emphasizes that coaches must differentiate their scope from licensed medical providers. Legally, coaches provide education, accountability, and support, whereas 'diagnosing' or 'prescribing' (even supplements or specific dosages) is reserved for licensed clinicians."

            "question": "In the context of 'Financial Architecture' (L3), if your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is $400 and your Lifetime Value (LTV) per client is $1,200, what is your LTV:CAC ratio and is it considered healthy?",
            "options": [

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 3:1 LTV:CAC ratio is widely considered the 'sweet spot' for professional coaching practices, indicating that for every dollar spent on marketing, three dollars are generated in lifetime revenue, allowing for operational overhead and profit."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-ticket sales (L4) require high trust. Demonstrating expertise through evidence-based content (webinars/white papers) establishes authority, which is essential for premium pricing in the metabolic health space."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scalability (L7) requires Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Without them, as the volume of clients increases, the quality of the intervention often drops because the delivery isn't systematized."
