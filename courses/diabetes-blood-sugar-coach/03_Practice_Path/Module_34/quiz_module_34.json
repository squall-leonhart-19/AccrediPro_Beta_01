            "question": "When architecting a scalable blood sugar group program, which cohort size is statistically associated with the highest levels of peer-to-peer engagement and retention according to the 'Social Density' principle?",
            "options": [
                "3-5 participants",
                "12-18 participants",
                "40-50 participants",
                "100+ participants"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research into group dynamics suggests that 12-18 participants is the 'sweet spot' for health coaching; it is large enough to ensure diverse perspectives and consistent activity, but small enough to prevent social loafing and maintain intimacy."

            "question": "In the context of Tuckman's Stages of Group Development, how should a Master Facilitator respond during the 'Storming' phase of a 12-week diabetes reversal group?",
            "options": [
                "Ignore the conflict to avoid giving it power.",
                "Immediately disband the group and move to 1-on-1 coaching.",
                "Normalize the conflict as a sign of progress and facilitate the creation of shared 'Community Agreements'.",
                "Strictly enforce the curriculum and prevent any non-educational discussion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Storming phase is a natural part of group development where members test boundaries. Facilitating shared agreements helps the group transition into the 'Norming' phase where real growth occurs."

            "question": "When designing an intensive workshop curriculum for blood sugar management, the '70-20-10' Rule of Learning suggests that 70% of the program should be dedicated to what?",
            "options": [
                "Didactic lectures and slide presentations",
                "Experiential learning and practical application (e.g., meal prep, glucose monitoring labs)",

                "Formal assessment and certification exams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 70-20-10 model posits that 70% of knowledge comes from job-related experiences (practical application), 20% from interactions with others, and only 10% from formal educational events."

            "options": [
                "To replace the need for a qualified coach or facilitator.",
                "To reduce the cost of software by avoiding live video tools.",
                "To maintain behavioral momentum between live sessions and provide 'just-in-time' support.",
                "To store legal documents and HIPAA waivers exclusively."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Asynchronous elements (like forums or chat apps) are critical for maintaining the 'behavioral arc,' ensuring participants remain engaged with their blood sugar goals when the coach is not present."

            "options": [
                "VOI is the same as ROI but used in non-profit sectors.",
                "VOI measures 'soft' outcomes like employee morale, energy levels, and presenteeism, whereas ROI focuses on direct healthcare cost savings.",
                "VOI measures the speed of weight loss, while ROI measures the reduction in HbA1c.",
                "VOI is a legal requirement for institutional partnerships, while ROI is optional."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While ROI (Return on Investment) looks at hard dollars saved, VOI (Value on Investment) looks at broader organizational benefits like culture, retention, and productivity which are vital for long-term corporate partnerships."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show that group-based interventions result in a statistically significant reduction of 0.5% to 0.8% in HbA1c, often outperforming individual care due to the social support and collective efficacy factors."

                "The coach can guarantee that all participants will keep each other's information secret.",
                "Participants are legally bound by HIPAA to the same extent as the healthcare provider.",
                "The coach must inform participants that while the coach maintains confidentiality, the group setting cannot guarantee absolute privacy from other members.",
                "Confidentiality is not required in a group setting as it is considered a public forum."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethically, a coach must provide a 'Group Confidentiality Disclosure' stating that they cannot control the actions of other participants, even though a culture of privacy is encouraged."

            "options": [
                "It allows the facilitator to stop working entirely while keeping 100% of the revenue.",
                "It enables rapid scaling and impact by allowing other trained professionals to deliver the curriculum under a brand's standards.",
                "It eliminates the need for any legal contracts or insurance.",
                "It prevents the facilitator from having to update the curriculum for at least 10 years."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Licensing allows the program's reach to expand exponentially without the founder needing to lead every session, while maintaining quality control through 'Train-the-Trainer' protocols."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "A participant in your group program, 'John,' consistently interrupts others to share complex medical research that confuses the group. This is known as 'The Expert' facilitator trap. How should you handle this?",
            "options": [
                "Publicly correct John to assert your dominance as the coach.",
                "Mute John and remove him from the program immediately.",
                "Acknowledge John's contribution and use a 'Parking Lot' strategy to address technical questions at the end, redirecting the group to the current objective.",
                "Stop the lesson and let John teach the rest of the session to save time."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Parking Lot' technique allows the facilitator to validate the participant without losing control of the group's time or the lesson's primary focus."

            "options": [
                "To make the data look more professional and scientific.",
                "To ensure the data is compatible with Microsoft Excel.",
                "To protect participant privacy by removing Personal Health Information (PHI) so the data can be analyzed as a group trend.",
                "To prevent the clinic from knowing which participants failed the program."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "De-identification is a legal and ethical requirement when sharing data with third parties, ensuring that individual identities are protected while still demonstrating the program's efficacy through group averages."
