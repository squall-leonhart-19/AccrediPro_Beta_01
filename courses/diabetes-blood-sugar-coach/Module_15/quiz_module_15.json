        {
            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the context of Advanced Glycemic Variability (GV), what is the clinically accepted Coefficient of Variation (CV) threshold above which a client's glucose is considered 'unstable'?",
            "options": ["24%", "30%", "36%", "42%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Coefficient of Variation (CV) of >36% is the established threshold defining high glycemic variability and unstable glucose control, significantly increasing the risk of hypoglycemia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "The 'Incretin Effect' accounts for what percentage of the total insulin response following an oral glucose load in healthy individuals?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-45%", "50-70%", "85-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In healthy individuals, the gut-derived hormones GLP-1 and GIP are responsible for 50-70% of the insulin response after eating, a mechanism that is often severely blunted in T2D patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which micronutrient acts as a critical cofactor for the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor, facilitating the initial step of insulin signaling?",
            "options": ["Magnesium", "Zinc", "Vitamin D3", "Manganese"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is essential for the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor's tyrosine kinase; deficiency leads to impaired post-receptor signaling and increased insulin resistance."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A client presents with a fasting glucose of 145 mg/dL. A 3:00 AM check reveals a glucose level of 58 mg/dL. Which physiological phenomenon is most likely occurring?",
            "options": ["Dawn Phenomenon", "Somogyi Effect", "Adaptive Thermogenesis", "Hepatic Glucose Paradox"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Somogyi Effect is characterized by rebound hyperglycemia in the morning following an undetected hypoglycemic event during the night (nocturnal hypoglycemia)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "According to Chrono-nutrition research, what is the observed effect on postprandial glucose when the same meal is consumed at 8:00 PM versus 8:00 AM?",
            "options": ["No significant difference in glucose response", "Glucose levels are approximately 20-30% higher in the evening", "Glucose levels are 15% lower in the evening due to melatonin", "Insulin sensitivity increases in the evening to prepare for fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Due to circadian rhythms, insulin sensitivity and the thermic effect of food (TEF) are highest in the morning; evening meals typically result in significantly higher glucose excursions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the pathophysiology of NAFLD, which process is specifically accelerated by high fructose intake, bypassing the rate-limiting enzyme phosphofructokinase?",
            "options": ["Glycogenolysis", "Beta-oxidation", "De novo lipogenesis (DNL)", "Ketogenesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fructose is metabolized primarily in the liver and directly enters the lipogenic pathway, driving De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and the accumulation of intrahepatic triglycerides."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "The 'Atherogenic Dyslipidemia' triad common in diabetic clients consists of which three markers?",
            "options": ["High LDL, High HDL, Low Triglycerides", "Low LDL, Low HDL, High Triglycerides", "High Triglycerides, Low HDL, Small Dense LDL particles", "High Total Cholesterol, High HDL, Low VLDL"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetes is specifically characterized by the triad of elevated triglycerides, low HDL levels, and the presence of small, dense LDL particles (Pattern B)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "What percentage of individuals with Type 2 Diabetes are estimated to experience 'Diabetes Distress' (DD) at any given time, according to recent meta-analyses?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "33-50%", "65-75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diabetes Distress (DD) is highly prevalent, affecting between 33% and 50% of the T2D population, and is distinct from clinical depression as it relates specifically to the burden of disease management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Which specific GLP-1 action is most responsible for the reduction in postprandial glucose spikes beyond its effect on insulin secretion?",
            "options": ["Inhibition of glucagon secretion", "Slowing of gastric emptying", "Increased renal glucose excretion", "Stimulation of hepatic glycogen storage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While GLP-1 does inhibit glucagon, its ability to slow gastric emptying (the 'ileal brake') is a primary mechanism for flattening postprandial glucose curves."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client has a Time in Range (TIR) of 70%, but a MAGE (Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursions) score of 120 mg/dL. What does this indicate to the coach?",
            "options": ["The client has excellent, stable control.", "The client is spending too much time in hypoglycemia.", "The client has high glycemic variability despite meeting TIR targets.", "The client's A1c is likely below 5.5%."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high MAGE score (typically >60-80 mg/dL) indicates significant glucose swings. Even if the client is within the 70-180 mg/dL range (TIR), high variability increases oxidative stress and vascular damage."
