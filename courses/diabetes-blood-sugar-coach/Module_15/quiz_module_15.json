            "options": [
                "To limit the number of clients you have to work with",
                "To establish yourself as a specialist, allowing for higher authority and value-based pricing",
                "Because general health coaching is legally prohibited in most states",
                "To avoid having to learn about different types of diabetes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Niche specialization allows a practitioner to tailor their expertise to a specific problem (e.g., Type 2 reversal or Gestational management), which increases perceived value and allows for higher pricing compared to a generalist."

                "Clients prefer paying for time rather than results",
                "It shifts the focus from the cost of your time to the impact of the transformation for the client",
                "Hourly billing is technically difficult to track in a digital practice"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Value-based pricing aligns the practitioner's compensation with the client's health outcomes (like reducing HbA1c or medication dependency) rather than just the time spent in a session."
