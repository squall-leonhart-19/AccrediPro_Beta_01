                "32–34 weeks"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Standard clinical guidelines (ADA and ACOG) recommend universal screening for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation using a 75g OGTT or a two-step approach."

            "question": "A 35-year-old lean patient is misdiagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes but fails to respond to oral agents and tests positive for Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

                "Cushing's Syndrome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LADA, often called Type 1.5, occurs in adults and is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies (like GAD) and a slower progression to insulin dependence than juvenile Type 1."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Which form of Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is the most common and is often characterized by extreme sensitivity to low-dose sulfonylureas?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In geriatric care, targets are relaxed to <8.0% or <8.5% for frail patients to prioritize the prevention of hypoglycemia, which carries higher risks of falls and cardiovascular events in the elderly."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "How does high-intensity anaerobic exercise, such as heavy weightlifting or sprinting, typically affect blood glucose levels during the activity?",
            "options": [
                "It causes an immediate and sharp decline in glucose.",
                "It may cause a transient rise in glucose due to catecholamine release.",
                "It has no measurable effect on blood glucose.",
                "It causes glucose to stabilize at exactly 100 mg/dL."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anaerobic exercise triggers a 'fight or flight' response, increasing adrenaline and glucagon, which causes the liver to release glucose, often resulting in a temporary spike."
        },

                "Compulsive checking of glucose levels more than 20 times per day."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diabulimia is a serious eating disorder where individuals with Type 1 Diabetes deliberately withhold insulin to lose weight through calorie loss in the urine (glycosuria)."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Late Dumping Syndrome occurs 1–3 hours after eating due to a rapid insulin surge in response to quick glucose transit into the small intestine, leading to reactive hypoglycemia."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "What is the primary concern when managing 'the honeymoon phase' in pediatric Type 1 Diabetes?",
            "options": [
                "The child has been cured of diabetes.",
                "Insulin needs may drop significantly, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia if doses aren't adjusted.",
                "The child will develop an immediate resistance to all insulin types.",
                "Ketones will always be high regardless of glucose levels."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The honeymoon phase is a period of temporary beta-cell recovery. Failure to reduce insulin doses during this time can lead to severe hypoglycemia."

                "Increase basal insulin by 20% to provide more energy.",
                "Stop all insulin 24 hours before the race.",
                "Reduce the mealtime bolus (before exercise) by 25–75%.",
                "Bolus for 100% of the carbohydrates consumed during the race."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For prolonged aerobic exercise, reducing the rapid-acting insulin dose taken before the activity (by 25-75% depending on intensity) is a primary strategy to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycemia."
