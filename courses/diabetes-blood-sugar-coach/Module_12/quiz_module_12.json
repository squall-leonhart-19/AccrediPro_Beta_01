            "question": "A 2019 study on Early Time-Restricted Feeding (eTRF) compared to a control group eating over 12 hours found that ending the eating window by 3:00 PM resulted in which specific metabolic outcome?",
            "options": [
                "Increased muscle protein synthesis despite lower caloric intake",
                "Significantly lower mean 24-hour glucose levels and reduced oxidative stress markers",
                "No change in insulin sensitivity but significant weight loss",
                "Increased LDL cholesterol due to prolonged fasting states"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "eTRF (finishing the eating window by mid-afternoon) aligns with circadian rhythms, which improves insulin sensitivity and lowers 24-hour glucose levels more effectively than late-shifted windows."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "When a Type 2 Diabetic client transitions to an extended fast (>24 hours), which class of medication carries the highest risk for 'euglycemic ketoacidosis'?",
            "options": [
                "Biguanides (Metformin)",
                "Sulfonylureas (Glipizide)",
                "SGLT2 Inhibitors (Canagliflozin)",
                "DPP-4 Inhibitors (Sitagliptin)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SGLT2 inhibitors can lead to euglycemic ketoacidosis during fasting because they promote glucose excretion while insulin levels are low, potentially causing a dangerous shift in ketone production without high blood sugar."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In the context of a therapeutic Ketogenic diet, what is the 'Physiological Insulin Resistance' (Adaptive Glucose Sparing) often observed in long-term adherents?",
            "options": [
                "A pathological state indicating the development of Type 2 Diabetes",
                "A temporary spike in blood sugar caused by high fat intake",
                "A benign adaptation where muscles preserve glucose for the brain by slightly reducing insulin sensitivity",
                "A failure of the pancreas to produce sufficient basal insulin"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Physiological insulin resistance is a glucose-sparing mechanism where the body prioritizes available glucose for the brain and RBCs while muscles utilize fatty acids and ketones; it is distinguished from pathological resistance by a low fasting insulin level."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Whole-food plant-based (WFPB) diets improve insulin sensitivity primarily through the production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Which mechanism describes how SCFAs like butyrate assist in glucose metabolism?",
            "options": [
                "By directly neutralizing dietary glucose in the stomach",
                "By activating G-protein coupled receptors (GPR41/43) that stimulate GLP-1 secretion",
                "By inhibiting the absorption of all dietary fats",
                "By increasing the excretion of insulin through the kidneys"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs produced from fiber fermentation act as signaling molecules that trigger the release of GLP-1 and PYY, hormones that enhance insulin secretion and improve satiety."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client is using an elimination diet to identify inflammatory triggers. After 21 days of elimination, they reintroduce dairy and notice a 20 mg/dL increase in fasting glucose the next morning. What is the likely physiological link?",
            "options": [
                "Dairy contains high amounts of hidden sucrose",
                "Systemic inflammation (evidenced by CRP) can acutely impair insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation",
                "The calcium in dairy inhibits the action of Metformin",
                "Dairy consumption immediately destroys pancreatic beta cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inflammatory responses to food triggers can increase pro-inflammatory cytokines, which interfere with the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) signaling, leading to acute insulin resistance and higher glucose."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Why does alcohol consumption pose a significant risk of 'delayed hypoglycemia' for diabetics taking insulin or secretagogues?",
            "options": [
                "Alcohol stimulates the rapid production of new insulin in the pancreas",
                "Alcohol increases the rate of gastric emptying, moving sugar too fast",
                "The liver prioritizes ethanol metabolism, which inhibits gluconeogenesis",
                "Alcohol molecules bind to glucose and prevent it from entering cells"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liver treats alcohol as a toxin and prioritizes its breakdown. This process uses up NAD+, which is required for gluconeogenesis, effectively shutting down the liver's ability to release glucose into the blood."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which of the following non-nutritive sweeteners has been shown in some clinical trials to potentially trigger a 'cephalic phase insulin response' despite having no calories?",
            "options": [
                "Erythritol",
                "Stevia (Rebaudioside A)",
                "Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K)",
                "Monk Fruit (Mogrosides)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While controversial, some studies suggest that Acesulfame Potassium can stimulate insulin secretion via the sweet taste receptors on the tongue and in the gut, even without a rise in blood glucose."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "Berberine is often compared to Metformin in its efficacy. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials found that 1500mg of Berberine daily was comparable to Metformin in reducing HbA1c. What is its primary mechanism of action?",
            "options": [
                "Binding to the insulin receptor to mimic insulin",
                "Activation of Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK)",
                "Inhibition of Alpha-glucosidase in the small intestine",
                "Increasing the excretion of glucose through sweat glands"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine activates AMPK, often called the 'metabolic master switch,' which increases glucose uptake in muscles and inhibits glucose production in the liver, similar to Metformin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Magnesium deficiency is prevalent in 25-38% of Type 2 Diabetics. What is the specific role of Magnesium in the insulin signaling pathway?",
            "options": [
                "It is a structural component of the insulin molecule",
                "It is required for the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor",
                "It transports glucose through the blood-brain barrier",
                "It prevents the breakdown of GLP-1 in the bloodstream"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium acts as a cofactor for the enzyme tyrosine kinase. Without adequate magnesium, the insulin receptor cannot properly 'switch on' to allow glucose to enter the cell (GLUT4 translocation)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client on a stable dose of 40 units of basal insulin wants to attempt a 36-hour fast. Based on clinical safety protocols, what is the typical recommended adjustment for their basal dose on the day of the fast?",
            "options": [
                "Stop all insulin immediately to allow for maximum fat burning",
                "Increase the dose by 10% to account for the stress of fasting",
                "Reduce the basal dose by 30% to 50% under medical supervision",
                "Keep the dose exactly the same but drink fruit juice if they feel shaky"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "To prevent severe hypoglycemia during a fast, clinical guidelines typically recommend a 30-50% reduction in basal insulin, though this must always be managed by the prescribing physician."
