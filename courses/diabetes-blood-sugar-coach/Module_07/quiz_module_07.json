            "question": "According to the Discordance Hypothesis discussed in Lesson 1, what is the primary driver of the modern metabolic disease epidemic?",
            "options": [
                "A lack of cardiovascular exercise compared to hunter-gatherer societies.",
                "The rapid shift from nutrient-dense whole foods to ultra-processed foods that our genes have not adapted to.",
                "A natural evolutionary decline in the human pancreas's ability to produce insulin.",
                "The consumption of too many saturated fats from animal sources."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Discordance Hypothesis posits that our genes, which evolved over 2.5 million years in a nutrient-scarce environment, are in conflict with the modern 'obesogenic' environment of calorie-rich, nutrient-poor processed foods."

        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "The 'Protein Leverage Hypothesis' suggests that humans will continue to consume energy (calories) until which requirement is met?",
            "options": [
                "A specific threshold of glucose for brain function.",
                "A specific volume of fiber to trigger gastric stretch receptors.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Protein Leverage Hypothesis states that the body prioritizes protein; if the diet is low in protein density, individuals will over-consume fats and carbohydrates to reach their protein target."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Using the STABLE Method™ 1:5 Fiber-to-Carb Ratio, if a food product contains 30 grams of Total Carbohydrates, what is the minimum amount of fiber it should contain to be considered 'metabolically favorable'?",
            "options": [
                "2 grams",
                "3 grams",

                "15 grams"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 1:5 ratio rule (Total Carbs divided by 5) suggests that for every 5g of carbs, there should be at least 1g of fiber. 30 / 5 = 6 grams of fiber."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical studies, including those by Shukla et al., show that sequencing protein and fiber before starch/sugar can reduce glucose excursions by 30-40% and insulin requirements by up to 50%."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-cells located in the lining of the intestines secrete GLP-1 in response to nutrients like short-chain fatty acids (from fiber fermentation) and bitter compounds."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Why are industrial seed oils (like soybean and corn oil) considered 'evolutionary mismatches' in the STABLE Method™?",
            "options": [
                "They contain too much Vitamin E which interferes with insulin.",
                "They are too expensive for the average client to maintain.",
                "They are high in Linoleic Acid (Omega-6), which can oxidize into pro-inflammatory compounds like 4-HNE.",
                "They have a smoke point that is too high for domestic cooking."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modern diets often have an Omega 6:3 ratio of 15:1 or higher, largely due to seed oils. High linoleic acid intake is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and systemic inflammation."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polyphenols slow down the breakdown of starches into simple sugars by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for carbohydrate digestion, leading to a flatter glucose curve."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "A client with a high TG/HDL ratio (>3.0) and significant insulin resistance (HOMA-IR > 2.5) would likely benefit MOST from which evolutionary variation initially?",
            "options": [
                "A High-Carb, Low-Fat Vegan diet.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with advanced insulin resistance often lack the 'metabolic flexibility' to handle moderate-to-high carb loads; a ketogenic or very low-carb approach helps lower insulin levels and improve the TG/HDL ratio rapidly."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Walnuts and olives provide healthy fats, fiber, and polyphenols with minimal glycemic impact, aligning with the nutrient density and low-inflammatory goals of Phase 6."
