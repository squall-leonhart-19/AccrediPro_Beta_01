            "question": "Which biomarker is considered superior to HbA1c for assessing glycemic control in clients with conditions that shorten red blood cell lifespan, such as hemolytic anemia or pregnancy?",
            "options": ["Fructosamine (Glycated Albumin)", "C-Peptide", "HOMA-IR", "Fasting Plasma Glucose"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Fructosamine measures glycated proteins (primarily albumin) which have a half-life of 14-21 days. Unlike HbA1c, it is not affected by red blood cell turnover rate, making it more accurate for those with anemia or rapid glycemic changes."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In the biochemistry of glucose transport, magnesium plays a critical role as a 'second messenger.' What is its specific function at the insulin receptor level?",
            "options": ["It binds to the alpha-subunit to trigger insulin release", "It is required for the autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor", "It inhibits the GLUT4 vesicle from reaching the cell membrane", "It degrades excess insulin in the bloodstream"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is a mandatory cofactor for the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor's beta-subunit. Without sufficient magnesium, the receptor cannot properly autophosphorylate, leading to systemic insulin resistance."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Which gut microbe is identified in Lesson 3 as a 'keystone species' for its ability to stimulate GLP-1 secretion and improve the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier?",
            "options": ["Lactobacillus acidophilus", "Akkermansia muciniphila", "Escherichia coli", "Bifidobacterium longum"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila interacts with the intestinal lining to increase the production of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), which enhances insulin secretion and slows gastric emptying."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Exercise triggers GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane even in the absence of insulin. Which signaling pathway is primarily responsible for this insulin-independent effect?",
            "options": ["The PI3K/Akt pathway", "The AMPK (Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase) pathway", "The mTOR pathway", "The Cortisol-Glucagon pathway"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Muscle contraction increases the AMP:ATP ratio, activating the AMPK pathway. This acts as an alternative 'back door' to move GLUT4 transporters to the cell surface, allowing glucose uptake without requiring insulin."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "The 'Dawn Phenomenon' is driven by the early morning surge of which hormone, leading to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "Cortisol", "Leptin", "Oxytocin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol levels naturally rise between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM. In insulin-resistant individuals, this surge triggers the liver to release excess glucose (gluconeogenesis) that the body cannot efficiently clear, resulting in high fasting numbers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "According to circadian biology research (Lesson 6), why is late-night eating particularly detrimental to glucose tolerance?",
            "options": ["Melatonin inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells via MTNR1B receptors", "The stomach stops producing digestive enzymes after 8:00 PM", "Cortisol levels are at their highest at midnight", "Glutamine is converted to glucose more rapidly at night"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Melatonin, the hormone of darkness, binds to receptors on the pancreas (MTNR1B) and inhibits insulin secretion. Eating when melatonin is high results in significantly higher post-prandial glucose levels."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "How does 'Diabetes Distress' differ from Clinical Depression in a coaching context?",
            "options": ["Diabetes Distress requires pharmaceutical intervention with SSRIs", "Diabetes Distress is specifically tied to the emotional burdens and worries of managing diabetes", "Diabetes Distress only affects patients with Type 1 Diabetes", "There is no difference; they are the same clinical diagnosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diabetes Distress is a specific emotional reaction to the rigors of diabetes management. Unlike clinical depression, it is directly linked to the disease state and often responds better to behavioral support and management education."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the S.T.A.B.L.E. Protocol (Lesson 8), what does the 'S' represent in the context of clinical case management?",
            "options": ["Sugar Restriction", "Stress & Sleep Optimization", "Sodium Reduction", "Sedentary Behavior Modification"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The S.T.A.B.L.E. Protocol begins with Stress & Sleep Optimization (S) because dysregulated cortisol and circadian rhythms can undermine even the best nutritional interventions."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A client has an HbA1c of 5.6% but frequently feels 'crashes' and brain fog after meals. Which test would best identify these hidden post-prandial glucose spikes?",
            "options": ["1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG)", "Fasting Insulin", "Total Cholesterol", "Uric Acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "1,5-Anhydroglucitol (marketed as GlycoMark) drops in the blood when glucose exceeds the renal threshold (approx. 180 mg/dL). It is the most sensitive marker for detecting glycemic variability and post-meal spikes over the previous 1-2 weeks."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Research on exercise timing (Lesson 4) suggests that a 15-minute walk is most effective for lowering the glucose excursion when performed:",
            "options": ["Immediately upon waking on an empty stomach", "60 minutes before the largest meal of the day", "15 to 45 minutes after starting a meal", "Immediately before going to sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'post-prandial window' (15-45 minutes after eating) is when glucose enters the bloodstream. Activating the GLUT4 'glucose sinks' through light activity during this window significantly flattens the glucose curve."
