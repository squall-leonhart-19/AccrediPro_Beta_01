            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "According to the 2019 International Consensus on Time in Range (TIR), what is the recommended target percentage for a non-pregnant adult with Type 2 Diabetes to spend between 70-180 mg/dL?",
            "options": [
                "Greater than 50%",
                "Greater than 60%",
                "Greater than 70%",
                "Greater than 90%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clinical guidelines establish that spending >70% of the day within the 70-180 mg/dL range correlates strongly with a reduction in microvascular complications, roughly equating to an HbA1c of 7.0% or less."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client's CGM data shows a steady rise in glucose starting around 3:00 AM and peaking at 8:00 AM, despite no food intake. There was no preceding hypoglycemia during the night. What is this pattern called?",
            "options": [
                "The Somogyi Effect",
                "The Dawn Phenomenon",
                "Reactive Hypoglycemia",
                "The Pizza Effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Dawn Phenomenon is characterized by an early-morning rise in blood glucose caused by the natural release of counter-regulatory hormones (growth hormone, cortisol, adrenaline) without a preceding low."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "When comparing Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) or CGM to traditional finger pricks, what is the 'lag time' caused by measuring interstitial fluid instead of capillary blood?",
            "options": [
                "0-2 minutes",
                "5-15 minutes",
                "20-30 minutes",
                "45-60 minutes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interstitial fluid glucose levels lag behind blood glucose levels by approximately 5 to 15 minutes because glucose must travel from the capillaries into the interstitial space."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In Phase 2 of the STABLE Method™, a 'Bio-individual Food Trigger' is typically identified when a specific food causes a glucose excursion of more than ____ mg/dL from the pre-meal baseline.",
            "options": [
                "10 mg/dL",
                "20 mg/dL",
                "30 mg/dL",
                "50 mg/dL"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While individual targets vary, the STABLE Method™ identifies a 'trigger' as a rise of >30 mg/dL from baseline, indicating a significant glycemic load or sensitivity to that specific food item."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Research cited in Lesson 5 indicates that a single night of sleep restriction (4 hours) can reduce peripheral insulin sensitivity by approximately how much?",
            "options": [

                "50%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies (e.g., Donga et al., 2010) have shown that even one night of partial sleep deprivation can reduce insulin sensitivity by 25-30%, leading to significantly higher next-day glucose readings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which metric is considered the 'gold standard' for assessing Glycemic Variability (GV) and is associated with increased oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk?",
            "options": [
                "Average Glucose",
                "Estimated HbA1c (eAG)",
                "Coefficient of Variation (%CV)",
                "Total Daily Dose (TDD)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Coefficient of Variation (%CV) measures the magnitude of glucose swings. A target of <36% is generally recommended to define 'stable' glucose control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client reports a 'scary' low glucose alert of 45 mg/dL at 2:00 AM. They felt no symptoms and a finger prick immediately showed 98 mg/dL. What is the most likely technical explanation?",
            "options": [
                "Sensor sensor failure",
                "A 'Compression Low' caused by sleeping on the sensor",
                "The Somogyi Effect",
                "Rapid insulin onset"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compression lows occur when physical pressure is applied to the sensor area, pushing interstitial fluid away from the filament, resulting in a false low reading that does not reflect actual blood glucose."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "The 'Pizza Spike' (a delayed glucose rise occurring 4-6 hours after a meal) is primarily caused by which physiological mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Rapid absorption of simple sugars",
                "High fat and protein content slowing gastric emptying and inducing late-phase insulin resistance",
                "The breakdown of fiber into glucose",
                "Stress-induced cortisol release from overeating"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-fat, high-protein meals slow down the digestion of carbohydrates and can increase insulin resistance several hours later, leading to a prolonged, delayed glucose elevation."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "When troubleshooting CGM accuracy, the '20/20 Rule' suggests that a sensor is considered accurate if it is within 20 mg/dL of a finger prick (if <200 mg/dL) or within ____% (if >200 mg/dL).",
            "options": [
                "5%",
                "10%",
                "15%",
                "20%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 20/20 rule is a standard for CGM accuracy: readings should be within 20 mg/dL of a lab-simulated value when glucose is low/normal, or within 20% when glucose is high."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary goal of 'Data-Driven Coaching' in Phase 2 of the STABLE Method™?",
            "options": [
                "To eliminate all carbohydrates from the client's diet",
                "To use real-time data to create a 'closed-loop' feedback system for behavioral change",
                "To replace the need for a primary care physician",
                "To focus solely on HbA1c regardless of daily fluctuations"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Data-driven coaching focuses on using CGM data as a biofeedback tool, allowing clients to see the immediate impact of food, stress, and movement, which facilitates more sustainable and personalized behavioral changes."
