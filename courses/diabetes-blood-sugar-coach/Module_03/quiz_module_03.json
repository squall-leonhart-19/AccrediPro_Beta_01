            "question": "Skeletal muscle is the primary site for post-prandial glucose disposal. Approximately what percentage of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake occurs in the skeletal muscle?",
            "options": [
                "40-50%",
                "60-70%",
                "Around 80%",
                "Over 95%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Skeletal muscle acts as the body's primary 'glucose sink,' accounting for approximately 80% of glucose clearance from the blood following a meal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which specific protein transporter is translocated to the cell membrane during muscle contraction, allowing for insulin-independent glucose uptake?",
            "options": [
                "GLUT1",
                "GLUT2",
                "GLUT3",
                "GLUT4"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "GLUT4 is the primary glucose transporter in muscle cells. During exercise, muscle contraction triggers GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface via the AMPK pathway, independent of insulin."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to the 'Power of Post-Prandial Movement' lesson, a 10-15 minute walk shortly after a meal has been shown to reduce glucose spikes by approximately how much?",
            "options": [
                "5-10%",
                "Around 22%",
                "Exactly 45%",
                "It only affects fasting glucose, not spikes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research (e.g., Reynolds et al., 2016) indicates that short bouts of post-meal walking can reduce the post-prandial glucose excursion by approximately 22% compared to a single daily bout of exercise."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client with Type 2 Diabetes is performing High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). What is the primary metabolic advantage of HIIT regarding 'Metabolic Conditioning'?",
            "options": [
                "It burns more fat during the actual work interval than Zone 2 cardio",
                "It increases mitochondrial density and GLUT4 expression more rapidly than steady-state work",
                "It eliminates the need for resistance training entirely",
                "It lowers blood sugar for only 30 minutes post-exercise"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIIT provides a potent stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis and increased GLUT4 expression, leading to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity in a fraction of the time required for traditional aerobic training."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "When applying the 'Rule of 15' for exercise-induced hypoglycemia, what is the correct procedure?",
            "options": [
                "Consume 15g of fiber and wait 15 minutes",
                "Consume 15g of fast-acting carbohydrates and retest blood glucose in 15 minutes",
                "Perform 15 minutes of light walking to stabilize the sugar",
                "Consume 15g of protein and 15g of fat to slow digestion"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Rule of 15 involves consuming 15 grams of fast-acting glucose (e.g., glucose tabs, juice) and waiting 15 minutes to retest blood sugar levels to ensure they have returned to a safe range (>70-90 mg/dL)."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Regarding 'Circadian Synchronization,' what does research suggest about the timing of high-intensity exercise for T2D clients?",
            "options": [
                "Morning exercise always results in the lowest HbA1c",
                "Late afternoon or evening exercise may be more effective for glucose control than morning sessions",
                "Exercise should only be performed at 4:00 AM for cortisol management",
                "Timing has no impact on glucose disposal whatsoever"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that late afternoon or early evening exercise (approx. 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM) may result in better glycemic control and insulin sensitivity improvements compared to morning exercise in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "Resistance training builds the 'Glucose Sink.' What is the primary mechanism by which hypertrophy improves long-term glycemic management?",
            "options": [
                "By increasing the total surface area and volume of tissue available for glucose storage",
                "By decreasing the body's need for amino acids",
                "By preventing the liver from producing any endogenous glucose",
                "By increasing the heart rate to aerobic zones"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hypertrophy increases the total amount of muscle mass. Since muscle is the primary site for glucose disposal, a larger 'sink' (more muscle) allows for greater total glucose clearance and improved basal metabolic rate."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client presents with a pre-exercise blood glucose reading of 310 mg/dL (17.2 mmol/L). According to safety guidelines, what is the appropriate action?",
            "options": [
                "Proceed with HIIT to burn off the excess sugar quickly",
                "Delay exercise and check for ketones; avoid vigorous activity until levels drop",
                "Drink a protein shake and start resistance training",
                "Perform 60 minutes of heavy deadlifts"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exercise is generally contraindicated if blood glucose is >300 mg/dL (or >250 mg/dL with ketones) because the stress response of exercise can further elevate glucose levels and increase the risk of ketoacidosis."

            "question": "What is the recommended minimum frequency for resistance training in the 'Activate Movement Coaching Blueprint' for T2D management?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Professional guidelines (ADA/ACSM) and the course blueprint recommend at least 2-3 days of resistance training per week, targeting all major muscle groups, to maintain insulin sensitivity."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have shown that prolonged sedentary time is a significant independent risk factor for T2D, with some data showing up to a 112% increased risk compared to those with high NEAT levels."
