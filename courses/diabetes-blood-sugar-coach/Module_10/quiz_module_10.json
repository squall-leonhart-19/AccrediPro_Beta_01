            "question": "Metformin is considered first-line therapy for Type 2 Diabetes. What is its primary mechanism of action?",
            "options": [
                "Stimulating the pancreas to secrete more insulin",
                "Increasing glucose excretion through the kidneys",
                "Inhibiting hepatic glucose production (gluconeogenesis)",
                "Slowing the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metformin primarily works by reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver (gluconeogenesis) and improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) represents a newer class of medication. How does its mechanism differ from Semaglutide (Ozempic)?",
            "options": [
                "It is a dual agonist targeting both GLP-1 and GIP receptors",
                "It is an oral medication rather than an injectable",
                "It works exclusively on the SGLT2 transport protein",
                "It is a long-acting basal insulin analog"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While Semaglutide is a selective GLP-1 receptor agonist, Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of both the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, often leading to greater weight loss and A1c reduction."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A client taking an SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g., Empagliflozin) should be specifically monitored for which of the following side effects due to the medication's mechanism?",
            "options": [
                "Severe hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy",
                "Genital mycotic infections (yeast infections)",
                "Rapid weight gain and peripheral edema",
                "Vitamin B12 deficiency"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SGLT2 inhibitors lower blood sugar by promoting glycosuria (excreting glucose in the urine). This increased urinary glucose provides a substrate for yeast growth, increasing the risk of genital mycotic infections."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When working with a client using rapid-acting insulin (e.g., Lispro or Aspart), what is the typical 'onset' time the coach should be aware of for mealtime bolusing?",
            "options": [
                "30 to 60 minutes",
                "5 to 15 minutes",
                "2 to 4 hours",
                "Immediate (0 minutes)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid-acting insulin analogs typically have an onset of 5 to 15 minutes, peak at 1 to 2 hours, and have a duration of 3 to 5 hours."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A 'Hybrid Closed-Loop' insulin pump system is characterized by which of the following?",
            "options": [
                "A pump that requires no user input for meals or exercise",
                "The integration of a CGM and an algorithm that automatically adjusts basal insulin delivery",
                "A manual pump that only delivers a set rate of insulin every 24 hours",
                "A system that eliminates the need for any fingerstick calibrations or site changes"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hybrid Closed-Loop systems (often called 'Artificial Pancreas' systems) use an algorithm to communicate between a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and an insulin pump to automatically adjust basal rates, though users still typically bolus for meals."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to the scope of practice for a Diabetes Coach, what is the appropriate response if a client complains of severe GI distress after starting Metformin?",
            "options": [
                "Tell the client to stop taking the medication immediately",
                "Suggest the client switch to the Extended Release (ER) version",
                "Advise the client to document their symptoms and consult their prescribing physician for a dosage adjustment",
                "Recommend a specific over-the-counter probiotic to mitigate the side effect"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coaches must never alter or recommend changes to prescription dosages. The correct action is to help the client document symptoms so they can have an informed conversation with their medical provider."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Which class of oral hypoglycemic agents carries the highest risk of causing hypoglycemia because it stimulates insulin secretion regardless of blood glucose levels?",
            "options": [
                "Biguanides (Metformin)",
                "Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone)",
                "Sulfonylureas (Glipizide)",
                "DPP-4 Inhibitors (Sitagliptin)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sulfonylureas are 'insulin secretagogues' that stimulate the beta cells to release insulin independently of blood glucose levels, significantly increasing the risk of hypoglycemia compared to Metformin or TZDs."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In the context of 'Deprescribing Support,' what is the coach's primary role when a client's blood sugar begins to normalize through lifestyle changes?",
            "options": [
                "Calculating the new, lower dose of insulin the client should take",
                "Providing the medical data and trends to the client to share with their doctor for potential medication reduction",
                "Informing the client that they are 'cured' and no longer need medication",
                "Contacting the doctor directly to demand a prescription change"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The coach supports deprescribing by helping the client gather organized data (CGM reports, food logs) that demonstrates the need for a medication review by the licensed medical provider."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as Pioglitazone, primarily work by activating which receptor to improve insulin sensitivity?",

                "GLUT4",
                "PPAR-gamma",
                "Alpha-glucosidase",
                "GLP-1"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TZDs are agonists for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), which regulates genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, primarily in adipose tissue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client on a GLP-1 agonist reports feeling 'excessively full' for 12+ hours after a small meal. Which physiological effect of the medication is likely responsible?",
            "options": [
                "Increased insulin sensitivity",
                "Delayed gastric emptying",
                "Suppression of glucagon",
                "Increased renal glucose threshold"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 agonists slow down gastric emptying (gastroparesis-like effect), which increases satiety but can lead to significant bloating or nausea if meal portions are not adjusted."
