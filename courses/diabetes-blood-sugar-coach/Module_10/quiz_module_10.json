            "question": "According to the Advanced Glycemic Variability standards, what is the target 'Coefficient of Variation' (CV) percentage recommended to define stable glycaemia and minimize hypoglycemia risk?",
            "options": [
                "Under 20%",
                "Under 36%",
                "Under 50%",
                "Exactly 70%"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Coefficient of Variation (CV) of <36% is the established clinical threshold for stable glycaemia. Values above 36% indicate high glycemic variability and a significantly increased risk of hypoglycemic events."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "In the context of the Gut-Incretin Axis, which specific bacterial species is most strongly associated with increased GLP-1 secretion and improved gut barrier integrity?",
            "options": [
                "Escherichia coli",
                "Lactobacillus acidophilus",
                "Akkermansia muciniphila",
                "Staphylococcus aureus"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila produces the protein Amuc_1100, which interacts with TLR2 to improve gut barrier function and stimulates GLP-1 secretion through the induction of L-cells."

        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Hepatic De Novo Lipogenesis (DNL) is significantly accelerated by fructose consumption because fructose bypasses which rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis?",
            "options": [
                "Glucokinase",
                "Phosphofructokinase (PFK)",
                "Pyruvate Kinase",
                "Hexokinase"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unlike glucose, fructose metabolism in the liver bypasses Phosphofructokinase (PFK), the main rate-limiting step of glycolysis. This leads to an unregulated flux of substrates into the DNL pathway, contributing to NAFLD."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, what is the primary reason many women experience a decrease in insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": [
                "Increased estrogen levels enhancing GLUT4",
                "The thermogenic effect of progesterone",
                "Elevated progesterone levels antagonizing insulin signaling",
                "A drop in cortisol levels"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the luteal phase, high levels of progesterone can have an anti-insulin effect, often requiring higher insulin doses or tighter carbohydrate management in women with diabetes to maintain euglycemia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Individuals carrying the risk allele of the MTNR1B gene should be particularly cautious with which lifestyle habit due to its impact on melatonin-induced insulin inhibition?",
            "options": [
                "High-intensity interval training",
                "Late-night eating (post-sunset)",
                "Morning caffeine consumption",
                "High-protein dieting"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTNR1B risk allele increases the expression of melatonin receptors on pancreatic beta cells. When melatonin rises (at night), it inhibits insulin secretion; therefore, late-night eating in these individuals results in significantly higher glucose excursions."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Berberine’s primary mechanism of action for lowering blood glucose is most similar to Metformin through the activation of which metabolic pathway?",
            "options": [
                "mTOR pathway",
                "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)",
                "The Polyol pathway",
                "The HPA Axis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine activates AMPK, which increases GLUT4 translocation, improves insulin sensitivity, and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, mirroring the primary mechanism of Metformin."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In the study of Psychometabolics, 'Reward Deficiency Syndrome' is characterized by the downregulation of which neuroreceptor in the striatum, often leading to sugar binging?",
            "options": [
                "Serotonin 5-HT1A",
                "Dopamine D2 receptors",
                "GABA-A receptors",
                "Cortisol receptors"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic overconsumption of hyper-palatable foods leads to a downregulation of Dopamine D2 receptors. This requires the individual to consume more sugar/fat to achieve the same 'reward' or dopamine spike, creating an addictive cycle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "The 'Athlete's Paradox' refers to the observation that endurance athletes have high levels of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) similar to T2D patients, but maintain high insulin sensitivity. Why is this?",
            "options": [
                "Athletes have lower mitochondrial density",
                "Athletes' IMCL is stored as inert droplets used for fuel during exercise",
                "Athletes have higher levels of systemic inflammation",
                "Athletes do not consume carbohydrates"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In athletes, IMCL is a metabolic adaptation providing a readily available fuel source that is frequently oxidized. In T2D, IMCL accumulates alongside toxic lipid intermediates (ceramides/diacylglycerols) because it is not being burned, leading to insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A client presents with an HbA1c of 6.5%, but their CGM data shows they spend 40% of their time above 180 mg/dL and 15% of their time below 70 mg/dL. What is the most critical intervention priority?",
            "options": [
                "Lowering the HbA1c further to 6.0%",
                "Increasing carbohydrate intake to prevent lows",
                "Reducing glycemic variability to increase Time in Range (TIR)",
                "Switching to a zero-carb diet immediately"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the HbA1c looks 'acceptable,' the high variability (high highs and frequent lows) is dangerous. The priority is to flatten the glucose curve and increase TIR to >70% to reduce oxidative stress and hypoglycemia risk."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "What is the 'Incretin Effect,' and how is it altered in patients with Type 2 Diabetes?",
            "options": [
                "It is the effect of glucagon on the liver; it is absent in T2D.",
                "It is the higher insulin response to oral vs. IV glucose; it is significantly diminished in T2D.",
                "It is the effect of exercise on glucose; it is enhanced in T2D.",
                "It is the release of cortisol in the morning; it is delayed in T2D."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Incretin Effect describes the fact that oral glucose elicits a much larger insulin response than intravenous glucose due to gut hormones (GLP-1/GIP). In Type 2 Diabetes, this effect is significantly blunted, contributing to postprandial hyperglycemia."
