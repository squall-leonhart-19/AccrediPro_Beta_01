    {
      "letter": "S",
      "meaning": "Stabilization of Glycemic Variability",
      "description": "The primary objective is to minimize 'blood sugar rollercoasters' by focusing on Time in Range (TIR) rather than just A1c. This involves utilizing the 'flattening the curve' principle to reduce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress caused by postprandial spikes."
    },
    {
      "letter": "T",
      "meaning": "Tactical Tracking & Data Integration",
      "description": "Evidence-based coaching relies on objective data from Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) or Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM). This step involves identifying bio-individual triggers by correlating specific foods, stressors, and sleep patterns with real-time glucose fluctuations."
    },
    {
      "letter": "A",
      "meaning": "Active Sensitization",
      "description": "This principle focuses on improving insulin receptor sensitivity through strategic physical movement and resistance training. By leveraging the GLUT4 translocation mechanism, we help clients clear glucose from the bloodstream into the muscle cells without a proportional increase in insulin secretion."
    },
    {
      "letter": "B",
      "meaning": "Biological & Endocrine Synergy",
      "description": "Diabetes management is not just about insulin; it requires balancing the entire endocrine system, including cortisol, glucagon, and leptin. We address the 'dawn phenomenon' and stress-induced hyperglycemia by optimizing the HPA axis and metabolic flexibility."
    },
    {
      "letter": "L",
      "meaning": "Lifestyle & Circadian Modulation",
      "description": "Blood sugar regulation is deeply tied to the body's internal clock and recovery systems. This step prioritizes sleep hygiene and stress resilience, as even a single night of partial sleep deprivation can induce insulin resistance in healthy individuals."
    },
    {
      "letter": "E",
      "meaning": "Evolutionary-Based Nutrition",
      "description": "This approach moves beyond simple calorie counting to focus on nutrient density, fiber-to-carb ratios, and the 'food order' effect. We emphasize whole-food interventions that align with human physiology to promote satiety and natural GLP-1 production."
