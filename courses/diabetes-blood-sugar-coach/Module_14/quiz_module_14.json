        {
            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which keystone bacterial species is specifically noted for its ability to degrade mucin, thereby strengthening the gut barrier and improving insulin sensitivity in overweight individuals?",
            "options": [
                "Lactobacillus acidophilus",
                "Akkermansia muciniphila",
                "Escherichia coli",
                "Bacteroides fragilis"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium that makes up 3-5% of the microbial community in healthy adults; its abundance is inversely correlated with obesity and insulin resistance."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "Metabolic Endotoxemia is characterized by a 2-3 fold increase in circulating levels of which substance, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LPS are pro-inflammatory molecules found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. When they leak into systemic circulation (endotoxemia), they bind to TLR4 receptors, triggering insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "In clinical meta-analyses, targeted multi-strain probiotic supplementation in Type 2 Diabetes patients has demonstrated an average HbA1c reduction of approximately:",

                "There is no measurable effect on HbA1c"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "The 'Second Meal Effect' describes how the fermentation of fiber at one meal improves glucose tolerance at the next. Which metabolite is primarily responsible for this by inhibiting free fatty acid release?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid produced during fiber fermentation, travels to the liver and inhibits gluconeogenesis and the release of free fatty acids, improving the glycemic response to subsequent meals."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Research published in 'Nature' (Suez et al.) highlighted that certain non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) can induce glucose intolerance. What was the primary mechanism identified?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study demonstrated that sweeteners like saccharin and sucralose alter the gut microbiome in a way that favors pathways associated with glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Chrono-nutrition suggests that the gut microbiome undergoes diurnal oscillations. How does late-night eating specifically disrupt this rhythm in relation to glucose?",
            "options": [
                "It increases Akkermansia production",
                "It aligns microbial genes with peripheral clocks",
                "It causes a phase-shift in microbial activity that impairs next-day insulin sensitivity",
                "It has no impact on the microbiome, only on the liver"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Late-night feeding disrupts the natural 'fasting' phase of the microbiome, leading to a loss of microbial rhythmicity which is associated with higher postprandial glucose levels the following morning."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a known endocrine disruptor. A 2021 study showed that even 'safe' levels of BPA exposure can lead to:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BPA interferes with insulin signaling pathways at the cellular level, specifically reducing the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, which prevents glucose from entering the cell."

                "Fiber has the same effect on everyone regardless of microbiome"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study found massive variability in how different people respond to the same food (e.g., some spiked on cookies, others on bananas), and this response was best predicted by combining microbiome data with clinical markers."

                "A low-fiber, high-protein diet"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Polyphenols and fermentable fibers strengthen the gut barrier and increase SCFA production, while high saturated fat (especially from processed sources) can actually facilitate the transport of LPS into the blood."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPR41/43) on enteroendocrine L-cells, triggering the release of GLP-1, which enhances insulin secretion and slows gastric emptying."
