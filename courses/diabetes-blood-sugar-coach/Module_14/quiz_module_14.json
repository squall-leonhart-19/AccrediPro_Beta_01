            "question": "According to the 'Power of Specificity' principle in Lesson 1, why is a niche like 'Post-Menopausal Women with Type 2 Diabetes' more profitable than 'General Health Coaching'?",
            "options": [
                "It allows for lower pricing due to a larger audience pool.",
                "It reduces marketing costs by increasing the conversion rate of targeted leads who feel 'seen'.",
                "It requires less specialized knowledge because the demographic is limited.",
                "General health coaching is legally restricted in most jurisdictions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Niche marketing increases the 'Resonance Factor.' When a client feels a program is designed specifically for their unique physiological and lifestyle challenges (like menopause and T2D), the perceived value and conversion rates increase significantly."

                "To provide a detailed 7-day meal plan to demonstrate immediate value."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective sales in health coaching relies on identifying the 'Gap.' By highlighting the emotional and physical cost of staying in their current state, the coach helps the client realize that the investment in coaching is less than the cost of continued health decline."

                "The coach is practicing within the scope of 'Educational Support'.",
                "This is considered 'Medical Nutrition Therapy' (MNT) and is legal for all coaches.",
                "This is a violation of the Scope of Practice as it constitutes 'Prescribing' or 'Adjusting Medication'.",
                "No boundary is crossed as long as the coach has a signed disclaimer."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diabetes coaches must never adjust, prescribe, or recommend changes to medication. This is the exclusive domain of licensed medical providers (MD, DO, NP, PA). Coaches should instead provide data for the client to discuss with their physician."

            "options": [
                "A prospect needs to interact with your brand an average of 7 times before making a purchase decision.",
                "You should only post on social media 7 times per month to avoid spamming.",
                "There are only 7 effective marketing channels for diabetes educators.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Rule of 7' is a classic marketing principle suggesting that repetition is key to building the trust and brand awareness necessary for a lead to convert into a paying client."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MOFU content is about nurturing leads. It bridges the gap between awareness and purchase by demonstrating expertise, showing results (case studies), and addressing common hesitations or myths."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Doctors are often frustrated by the lack of time they have for patient education. A coach provides the 'implementation' of the doctor's clinical goals, improving patient outcomes and making the doctor's job easier."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "High-ticket coaching is 'Value-Based' or 'Outcome-Based.' Clients pay for the result (reversing insulin resistance, avoiding complications) rather than just buying an hour of the coach's time."
