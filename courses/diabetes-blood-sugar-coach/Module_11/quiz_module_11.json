            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies, including those cited by the American Diabetes Association, suggest that 33% to 50% of people with diabetes experience diabetes distress—a specific emotional response to the burdens of managing the condition—which is significantly higher than the rate of clinical depression."

                "The Correction Bias"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Righting Reflex' is a natural but counterproductive tendency for practitioners to take the 'pro-change' side of an argument, which often triggers the client to defend their current behavior (sustain talk)."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A client says, 'I feel like I'm failing because I can't keep my glucose in range 100% of the time.' Which Cognitive Behavioral technique involves helping the client view this thought as a 'mental event' rather than an absolute truth?",

                "Behavioral Activation",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Decentering, or cognitive defusion, is a CBT technique where the client learns to observe thoughts as transient mental events rather than facts, reducing the emotional impact of 'all-or-nothing' thinking."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery experiences—the actual performance of a behavior and the resulting success—are the most influential source of self-efficacy. Small, achievable wins are critical for building long-term confidence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Person-first language (e.g., 'person with diabetes') avoids defining the individual by their disease, reducing stigma and promoting a more collaborative and empowered coaching relationship."

            "explanation": "Option B is Specific (walking after dinner), Measurable (20 minutes, 3 days), Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (next month). The other options are either too vague, unrealistic, or lack a timeframe."

                "The client refuses to share their diagnosis with their spouse."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Miscarried helping occurs when family members try to help (e.g., acting as the 'carb police') but do so in a way that feels controlling or critical, which often increases the client's stress and worsens metabolic outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Urge surfing teaches clients that cravings are temporary. By 'riding the wave' and observing the sensation without judgment or action, the craving naturally peaks and then declines in intensity."
