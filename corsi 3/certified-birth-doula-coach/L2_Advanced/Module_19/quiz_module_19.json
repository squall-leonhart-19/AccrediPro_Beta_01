        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial initial step in evidence-based doula practice?",
            "options": ["Implementing a new comfort technique immediately.", "Asking a clinical expert their opinion.", "Formulating a specific clinical question.", "Relying solely on personal experience."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Formulating a well-defined clinical question (often using the PICO framework) is the foundation of evidence-based practice, guiding the search for relevant research."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A doula is looking for studies on the effectiveness of acupressure for labor pain. Which database would be the MOST appropriate starting point for her search?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed", "Wikipedia", "A personal blog about childbirth"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including studies on alternative therapies like acupressure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What does the acronym 'PICO' stand for in the context of formulating a research question?",
            "options": ["Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome", "Procedure, Information, Control, Observation", "Problem, Interest, Context, Observation", "Population, Investigation, Comparison, Observation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "PICO is a framework used to define and structure clinical questions, ensuring they are focused and searchable. It stands for Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A research study reports a p-value of 0.06. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The results are statistically significant.", "The results are not statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level.", "The study is perfectly designed.", "The sample size is too small."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 means there is a 6% chance of observing the results if there is no real effect. This is above the conventional significance level of 0.05, so the results are not considered statistically significant."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "According to several meta-analyses discussed in the module, doula support is associated with which of the following positive birth outcomes?",
            "options": ["Increased rates of Cesarean birth", "Decreased use of epidural analgesia", "Longer duration of labor", "Increased postpartum depression"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show that doula support is associated with a decreased need for epidural analgesia, as well as shorter labors and fewer Cesarean births. Cunningham et al. (2023) highlighted this in their review."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A doula client states, 'I heard that doulas can guarantee a pain-free birth.' How should the doula respond, based on evidence-based practice?",
            "options": ["'That's absolutely correct! I have a 100% success rate.'", "'While doulas can provide significant comfort and support, we cannot guarantee a pain-free birth. Pain perception is individual and influenced by many factors.'", "'I can give you a special herb that will eliminate all pain.'", "'You're right, but it only works if you follow my instructions perfectly.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to manage client expectations realistically. Doulas provide support, but cannot eliminate pain. Transparency builds trust and avoids misleading clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is an ethical consideration when applying research findings in doula practice?",
            "options": ["Only using research that confirms your personal beliefs.", "Providing clients with biased information to influence their decisions.", "Ensuring clients understand the limitations of the research.", "Withholding information about potential risks associated with an intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is crucial. Clients need to understand the evidence supporting (or not supporting) an intervention, as well as any potential risks or limitations, to make autonomous decisions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the case study of Maria, a 32-year-old first-time mother, what was the primary benefit observed from continuous doula support during her labor?",
            "options": ["Complete elimination of labor pain", "A significant reduction in anxiety and improved coping mechanisms", "A guaranteed vaginal birth", "An extremely short labor duration"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While outcomes vary, Maria's case highlighted the positive impact of doula support on reducing anxiety and improving coping skills during labor, leading to a more positive birth experience. The case study did not guarantee any specific birth outcome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective way for a doula to advocate for evidence-based care within a hospital setting?",
            "options": ["Arguing with nurses and doctors about their practices.", "Presenting research findings respectfully and collaboratively to the care team.", "Demanding that the hospital change its policies immediately.", "Ignoring hospital protocols and implementing your own methods."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaboration and respectful communication are key. Presenting research findings in a non-confrontational manner and working with the care team fosters a positive environment for change."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is the MOST significant limitation of relying solely on anecdotal evidence (personal stories) when making recommendations to clients?",
            "options": ["Anecdotal evidence is always more reliable than research.", "Personal stories are always false.", "Anecdotal evidence is subject to bias and cannot be generalized.", "Personal stories are only valuable if they come from experts."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Anecdotal evidence can be compelling, but it's inherently biased and doesn't account for confounding factors. Research studies use rigorous methods to minimize bias and determine cause-and-effect relationships."
