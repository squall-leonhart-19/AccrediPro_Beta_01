            "question": "A client expresses anxiety about an upcoming induction due to a history of traumatic medical experiences. Which communication technique is MOST effective in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Reassuring her that inductions are routine and safe.", "Exploring her past experiences and validating her feelings.", "Advising her to discuss her concerns with her doctor and trust their judgment.", "Suggesting alternative therapies to avoid induction."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring past experiences and validating feelings acknowledges the client's trauma and builds trust, which is crucial in advanced communication. Dismissing her feelings or offering medical advice falls outside the doula's scope."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "To scale your doula business effectively, which of the following systems should be prioritized for automation or delegation FIRST?",
            "options": ["Client intake and scheduling.", "Providing continuous labor support.", "Postpartum visits.", "Creating personalized birth plans."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Automating or delegating client intake and scheduling frees up significant time for core doula services, allowing for more efficient use of resources and scalability. While other tasks are important, they are less directly related to initial client acquisition."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Which marketing strategy is MOST effective for attracting a specific niche of clients, such as those seeking VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean) support?",
            "options": ["General social media advertising.", "Partnering with a local hospital.", "Creating targeted content highlighting VBAC success stories and resources.", "Offering discounts on all doula packages."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Targeted content that speaks directly to the needs and concerns of VBAC clients is more likely to attract the desired niche. General advertising lacks focus, and discounts don't necessarily attract the right clientele."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "During the active phase of labor, a client's contractions become less effective, and the baby is showing signs of fetal distress. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate action for a doula?",
            "options": ["Suggesting a change in position and breathing techniques.", "Administering oxygen.", "Contacting the client's doctor or midwife immediately.", "Preparing the client for an emergency cesarean section."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fetal distress requires immediate medical attention. The doula's role is to recognize the signs and alert the medical team. Administering oxygen is beyond the doula's scope, and preparing for a C-section preemptively could increase anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A postpartum client is experiencing symptoms of baby blues that are worsening and interfering with her ability to care for her baby. What is the doula's MOST appropriate response?",
            "options": ["Assuring her that these feelings are normal and will pass.", "Encouraging her to rest and eat well.", "Suggesting she contact her healthcare provider to discuss postpartum depression.", "Offering to take care of the baby so she can sleep."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While rest and nutrition are helpful, worsening baby blues could indicate postpartum depression, which requires professional evaluation. A doula should encourage the client to seek medical advice. Taking care of the baby is a temporary fix and doesn't address the underlying issue."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "According to a 2022 study by the Doula Training Organization (DTO), doulas who actively manage their business finances and reinvest a percentage of their income see an average increase in annual revenue of:",
            "options": ["5%", "15%", "25%", "35%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The DTO study highlighted the importance of financial planning for doulas, linking reinvestment strategies to a 15% average revenue increase."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A doula is offered a substantial sum of money by a client to keep information about a medical complication during birth confidential from the client's family. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Accept the money and maintain confidentiality.", "Decline the money and maintain confidentiality.", "Decline the money and encourage the client to disclose the information to her family.", "Report the client to the authorities."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A doula's ethical obligation is to the client's well-being and autonomy. Encouraging open communication within the family is the most ethical approach. Accepting money for secrecy violates professional boundaries and could harm the client's support system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which self-care strategy is MOST effective in preventing burnout for doulas who frequently attend long and unpredictable births?",
            "options": ["Maintaining a strict work schedule.", "Avoiding discussing difficult births with others.", "Regularly practicing mindfulness and setting clear boundaries.", "Relying solely on caffeine for energy during births."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness and boundary setting are crucial for managing the emotional and physical demands of doula work. Strict schedules are often unrealistic, and suppressing feelings can lead to burnout."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client in early labor states, 'I feel like I can't do this. The pain is too much!' Using advanced communication, which response is MOST empathetic and empowering?",
            "options": ["'Don't worry, you're doing great! It will be over soon.'", "'I understand this is intense. Let's focus on your breathing and find a comfortable position. You are strong, and I'm here to support you.'", "'Have you considered an epidural? It might help you relax.'", "'Think about the baby you'll have at the end of this.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This response validates the client's feelings, offers practical support, and reinforces her strength. The other options either dismiss her feelings or suggest interventions without exploring her needs."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "You are developing a new doula package specifically for single mothers. Which of the following pricing strategies is MOST likely to attract this client base while ensuring business sustainability?",
            "options": ["Offering the same pricing as your standard packages.", "Significantly increasing the price to reflect the specialized support.", "Providing a tiered pricing structure with options for payment plans and sliding scale fees.", "Offering a one-time discount that expires quickly."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A tiered pricing structure with flexible payment options makes doula services more accessible to single mothers with varying financial situations while maintaining the doula's income. Standard pricing might be unaffordable, and excessive pricing could deter clients."
