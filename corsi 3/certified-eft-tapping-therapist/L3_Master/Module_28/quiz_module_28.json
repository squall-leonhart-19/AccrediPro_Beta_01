            "question": "When using EFT for crisis intervention, what is the FIRST priority?",
            "options": ["Identifying the core issue", "Establishing safety and rapport", "Applying the full EFT protocol", "Challenging negative beliefs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In crisis intervention, safety and rapport are paramount before any therapeutic technique can be effective. Establishing a safe environment allows the client to feel secure enough to engage in the process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "Which EFT technique is MOST appropriate for a client experiencing intense trauma-related flashbacks?",
            "options": ["The Movie Technique", "The Tearless Trauma Technique", "Cognitive Restructuring", "Standard EFT tapping sequence"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Movie Technique allows the client to process the trauma in a controlled and gradual manner, reducing the intensity of the flashback by creating psychological distance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A client with dissociative identity disorder (DID) presents with a fragmented sense of self. What is a PRIMARY goal of EFT therapy in this case?",
            "options": ["Integrating all alters into one personality", "Facilitating communication and collaboration among alters", "Suppressing the expression of different alters", "Identifying the 'original' personality"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EFT aims to foster communication and collaboration among the different alters, promoting internal harmony and reducing distress associated with the fragmented sense of self, rather than attempting to eliminate or merge them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "In EFT therapy for addictions, what does 'craving intensity reduction' typically involve?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating all cravings", "Reducing the intensity of cravings to a manageable level", "Replacing cravings with positive affirmations", "Ignoring the cravings and focusing on other issues"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EFT aims to reduce the intensity of cravings to a manageable level, allowing the client to make conscious choices and resist impulsive behaviors. Complete elimination is often unrealistic and not the primary goal."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on grief and loss, what distinguishes 'complicated grief' from normal grief?",
            "options": ["The intensity of emotional pain", "The duration and impact on daily functioning", "The presence of specific grief rituals", "The expression of anger and resentment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complicated grief is characterized by its prolonged duration and significant impact on daily functioning, interfering with the individual's ability to resume normal activities and relationships, unlike normal grief which typically resolves over time."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports a fear of movement (kinesiophobia). How can EFT be used to address this fear?",
            "options": ["By directly challenging the client's beliefs about movement", "By focusing on the physical sensations of pain during movement", "By addressing the underlying emotional roots of the fear", "By avoiding any discussion of movement during therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EFT can address the emotional roots of the fear, such as past experiences of injury or trauma, which contribute to the kinesiophobia. By resolving these emotional issues, the client may feel more comfortable and confident in their ability to move without pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "When assessing a client for suicidal ideation, what is a CRITICAL question to ask?",
            "options": ["'Have you been feeling down lately?'", "'Do you have a plan to harm yourself?'", "'Are you thinking about death?'", "'Do you think things will get better?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Directly asking about a specific plan to harm oneself is crucial in assessing the immediate risk of suicide. This question helps determine the level of intent and the availability of means."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "In advanced case conceptualization, what is the purpose of identifying 'core beliefs'?",
            "options": ["To provide a diagnosis for the client", "To understand the underlying patterns driving the client's behavior", "To blame the client for their problems", "To create a positive self-image for the client"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying core beliefs helps understand the underlying patterns that drive the client's behavior and emotional responses. These beliefs often stem from early experiences and significantly influence their perception of themselves and the world."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of childhood trauma and current addiction struggles reports feeling 'numb' and disconnected. Which EFT-based approach would be MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Directly targeting the addiction cravings", "Addressing the trauma memories using the Movie Technique", "Focusing on grounding techniques and present-moment awareness", "Challenging the client's negative self-beliefs"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "When a client reports feeling numb or disconnected, grounding techniques and present-moment awareness exercises are essential to help them reconnect with their body and emotions before addressing more intense issues like trauma memories or addiction cravings."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A therapist is working with a client who has experienced a recent loss and is exhibiting signs of complicated grief, including persistent feelings of hopelessness and inability to function. What is the MOST ETHICAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue with EFT therapy, focusing on positive affirmations", "Refer the client to a specialist in grief counseling or trauma therapy", "Encourage the client to suppress their emotions and move on", "Prescribe antidepressant medication for the client"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Referring the client to a specialist in grief counseling or trauma therapy is the most ethical course of action when the client exhibits signs of complicated grief and the therapist lacks the necessary expertise to address the complex issues involved. This ensures the client receives appropriate and specialized care."
