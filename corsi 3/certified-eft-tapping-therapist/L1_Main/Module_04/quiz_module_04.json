            "question": "What is the primary purpose of using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) in EFT?",
            "options": ["To diagnose mental health disorders", "To provide a standardized measure of emotional intensity", "To replace traditional psychological assessments", "To predict client behavior"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SUDS scale provides a quantifiable way to track changes in emotional intensity before, during, and after EFT sessions, allowing for objective measurement of progress."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "When calibrating to a client's emotional state, which of the following is MOST important?",
            "options": ["Offering immediate solutions to their problems", "Matching their emotional intensity exactly", "Observing their nonverbal cues and listening attentively", "Avoiding any discussion of their negative emotions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective calibration involves paying close attention to a client's body language, tone of voice, and overall presentation to understand and acknowledge their emotional experience. Mirroring their intensity exactly can be counterproductive."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a cognitive reframing technique used during EFT tapping?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to suppress negative thoughts", "Replacing a negative thought with a more balanced and positive one", "Avoiding any discussion of past traumas", "Focusing solely on physical sensations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing involves helping clients to view their situations from a different perspective, often by challenging negative thought patterns and replacing them with more realistic or positive ones."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Psychological Reversal (PR) is often addressed in EFT by tapping on which point while stating a setup phrase?",
            "options": ["Under the nose", "Collarbone", "Side of the hand (Karate Chop)", "Under the arm"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Karate Chop point is typically used during the setup phrase to address Psychological Reversal and affirm self-acceptance despite the problem."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which technique is MOST suitable when working with a highly sensitive client during EFT?",
            "options": ["Flooding", "Gentle tapping and slower pacing", "Aggressively challenging their beliefs", "Rapidly progressing through the tapping sequence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Highly sensitive clients often benefit from a more gentle and gradual approach, allowing them to process emotions at their own pace. Intense techniques like flooding can be overwhelming."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A client begins to experience intense emotions during a tapping session. Which de-escalation technique would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Continuing the tapping sequence without modification", "Immediately stopping the session and rescheduling", "Shifting focus to a neutral or positive topic", "Encouraging the client to fully express their anger"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shifting focus to a neutral or positive topic can help to diffuse intense emotions and allow the client to regain a sense of control. Pushing through can be retraumatizing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "If a client's SUDS score remains consistently high despite multiple EFT sessions, this indicates:",
            "options": ["The client is resistant to therapy", "EFT is not an appropriate treatment for this client", "A potential stuck point or underlying issue that needs to be addressed", "The client is exaggerating their emotional distress"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Persistent high SUDS scores suggest that there may be an underlying issue or resistance that is preventing the client from fully processing their emotions. This warrants further exploration."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to ethical guidelines, what is the MOST important consideration when evaluating and easing emotional intensity in EFT?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice prioritizes the client's safety and well-being above all else. This includes respecting their boundaries, avoiding harm, and ensuring they feel safe and supported throughout the process."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A client reports a SUDS score of 8 before tapping on a traumatic memory. After one round of tapping, their SUDS score is 6. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The tapping was ineffective.", "The client is minimizing their distress.", "The client is making progress, but further tapping is likely needed.", "The client has fully resolved the issue."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A decrease in SUDS score indicates progress, but a score of 6 still suggests significant distress. Continued tapping and exploration are warranted."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "In a case study, a client named Sarah experienced a sudden surge of anxiety during tapping. Which of the following actions would be MOST appropriate for the therapist?",
            "options": ["To immediately stop the session and refer Sarah to a psychiatrist.", "To continue tapping on the anxiety while reassuring Sarah that it will pass.", "To gently guide Sarah back to a safe and comfortable emotional state using techniques like the 'Movie Technique' or 'Tearless Trauma' protocol.", "To challenge Sarah's anxiety and encourage her to face her fears head-on."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle techniques like the 'Movie Technique' or 'Tearless Trauma' protocol are designed to help clients process intense emotions in a safe and controlled manner. Suddenly stopping the session or aggressively challenging the client could be counterproductive."
