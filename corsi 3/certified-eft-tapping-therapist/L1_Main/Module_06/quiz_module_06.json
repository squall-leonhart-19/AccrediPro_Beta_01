            "options": ["Addressing core limiting beliefs immediately.", "Establishing a strong therapeutic rapport and sense of safety.", "Using advanced EFT techniques to clear traumatic memories.", "Encouraging the client to fully express their anger and rage."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing rapport and safety is paramount in trauma work. Prematurely addressing core beliefs or traumatic memories can be destabilizing."

            "options": ["Continuing with standard EFT protocol to break through the dissociation.", "Using gentle, invitational language and focusing on present-moment sensations.", "Increasing the intensity of tapping to stimulate emotional processing.", "Encouraging the client to visualize the traumatic event in detail."],

            "explanation": "Gentle, invitational language and present-moment focus can help ground the client and reduce dissociation. Avoid techniques that may overwhelm the client."

            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST reflects the relationship between limiting beliefs and trauma?",
            "options": ["Limiting beliefs are unrelated to traumatic experiences.", "Traumatic experiences can often lead to the development of deeply ingrained limiting beliefs.", "Limiting beliefs are always conscious and easily identified by the client.", "Addressing limiting beliefs is only relevant for clients without a trauma history."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma frequently shapes negative core beliefs about self, others, and the world. These beliefs then perpetuate distress."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client expresses intense shame related to a past traumatic event. Which EFT technique is MOST likely to be helpful in addressing this shame?",
            "options": ["Directly challenging the client's shame-based beliefs with logical arguments.", "Encouraging the client to fully re-experience the traumatic event to desensitize them to the associated shame.", "Using EFT while focusing on self-compassion statements and acceptance.", "Ignoring the shame and focusing solely on the factual details of the event."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Combining EFT with self-compassion helps to gently address shame without overwhelming the client. Direct confrontation or re-experiencing can be retraumatizing."

            "explanation": "Proactive EFT builds resilience and helps clients manage anxiety before it escalates into a panic attack. Directly targeting trauma too soon can be overwhelming."
