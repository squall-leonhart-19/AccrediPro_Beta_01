        {
            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the Standard EFT Tapping Sequence?",
            "options": ["A random selection of tapping points used based on client preference.", "A set sequence of tapping points designed to address a wide range of emotional and physical issues.", "A sequence that only targets physical pain and discomfort.", "A sequence that changes with every round of tapping."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Standard EFT Tapping Sequence is a specific, pre-defined series of points intended to address various issues comprehensively. It's not random or limited to physical pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Setup Statement performed at the Karate Chop point?",
            "options": ["To distract the client from their emotional discomfort.", "To introduce and acknowledge the problem while simultaneously accepting oneself.", "To completely eliminate the negative emotion before tapping begins.", "To predict the outcome of the tapping session."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Setup Statement acknowledges the issue and includes self-acceptance, which is crucial for effective EFT. It's not about distraction or immediate elimination of the emotion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and unable to articulate their issue during the tapping sequence. Which facial tapping point might be particularly helpful in addressing this initial overwhelm?",
            "options": ["Under the Nose (UN)", "Under the Eye (UE)", "Eyebrow (EB)", "Chin (CH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Under the Nose (UN) point is often associated with releasing feelings of overwhelm and can help a client regain clarity. While other points are useful, UN is specifically helpful for overwhelm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Which upper body tapping point is MOST closely associated with releasing anxiety related to decision-making?",
            "options": ["Collarbone (CB)", "Under the Arm (UA)", "Top of Head (TH)", "Eyebrow (EB)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Collarbone (CB) point is linked to releasing anxiety and can be especially helpful when the client is struggling with decisions. Tapping here can help clear mental blocks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What is the recommended tapping pace to maintain flow and rhythm during the EFT sequence?",
            "options": ["As fast as possible to quickly move through the points.", "A slow, deliberate pace with long pauses between each point.", "A moderate, consistent pace that feels natural and allows for focus on the issue.", "An irregular pace, alternating between fast and slow tapping."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A moderate, consistent pace allows the client to focus on the issue while maintaining a natural rhythm. Extremely fast or slow pacing can be disruptive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client with a history of trauma becomes visibly distressed during the tapping sequence. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?",
            "options": ["Continue tapping through the sequence to push through the discomfort.", "Immediately stop tapping and assess the client's safety and comfort.", "Instruct the client to focus on positive affirmations to counteract the distress.", "Increase the intensity of the tapping to quickly resolve the issue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount. Immediately stopping and assessing the client's well-being is crucial when dealing with trauma. Continuing to tap could retraumatize the client."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client's SUDs (Subjective Units of Distress Scale) score remains unchanged after several rounds of tapping. What is the MOST likely explanation for this resistance?",
            "options": ["The client is not tapping hard enough.", "The client is not being honest about their feelings.", "There may be an underlying psychological reversal or secondary gain.", "The client has a rare condition that makes EFT ineffective."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent lack of progress often indicates a psychological reversal or secondary gain that needs to be addressed before EFT can be effective. It's less likely to be due to tapping force or dishonesty."

        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "In the RESET framework, where does the Sequence Tapping Points component fit into the overall process?",
            "options": ["It is the first step, used to establish rapport.", "It is used after identifying the Specific Event to target the emotional charge.", "It is used as a final step to reinforce positive changes.", "It is used only when other RESET components fail."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sequence Tapping Points are used after identifying the Specific Event in the RESET framework to directly address and reduce the emotional charge associated with the event. This is the core of the emotional processing in RESET."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "According to a case study discussed in the lesson, a 45-year-old client named Sarah, experiencing chronic anxiety, showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">40% reduction</span> in anxiety symptoms after how many EFT sessions incorporating the standard tapping sequence?",
            "options": ["One session", "Three sessions", "Six sessions", "Ten sessions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study of Sarah highlighted that it took six EFT sessions, using the standard tapping sequence, to achieve a notable 40% reduction in her chronic anxiety symptoms. This demonstrates the cumulative benefit of consistent EFT practice."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "During the 'Reminder Phrase' portion of the tapping sequence, which of the following is the MOST important consideration?",
            "options": ["Using a completely positive statement to counteract the negative emotion.", "Repeating the original problem statement exactly as it was initially expressed.", "Using a phrase that acknowledges the problem while also incorporating a sense of acceptance or hope.", "Avoiding any mention of the problem to prevent re-traumatization."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Reminder Phrase should acknowledge the remaining negative emotion while subtly shifting towards acceptance or hope. This helps to gradually reframe the issue without forcing positivity or ignoring the client's experience."
