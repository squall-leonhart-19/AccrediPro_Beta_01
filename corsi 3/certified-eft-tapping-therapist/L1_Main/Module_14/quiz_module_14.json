      "question": "When using the 'Tell the Story' technique, what is the primary goal during the initial recounting of the event?",
      "options": [
        "To immediately reduce the emotional intensity.",
        "To gather detailed information without judgment and assess SUDs level.",

      "explanation": "The initial recounting aims to understand the client's experience fully, including details and SUDs level, without immediate intervention."

        "Increase the intensity of the tapping to force a reduction in the SUDs level."
