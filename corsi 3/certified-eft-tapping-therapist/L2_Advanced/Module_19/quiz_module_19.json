            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of a meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["It focuses on a single, in-depth case study.", "It combines the results of multiple independent studies.", "It relies solely on anecdotal evidence.", "It only considers qualitative data."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A meta-analysis systematically combines the results of multiple independent studies to arrive at an overall conclusion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to the research discussed, what is the approximate average effect size (Cohen's d) of EFT for anxiety compared to control groups?",
            "options": ["d = 0.10 (negligible)", "d = 0.30 (small)", "d = 0.60 (medium)", "d = 1.20 (very large)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses suggest that EFT typically shows a medium effect size (around d = 0.60) for anxiety compared to control groups, indicating a meaningful reduction in anxiety symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Which type of study design is considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention like EFT?",
            "options": ["Case study", "Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)", "Observational study", "Qualitative interview"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard because they use random assignment to control for confounding variables and establish causality."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the context of trauma and PTSD research, what is a common criticism of studies evaluating EFT?",
            "options": ["Over-reliance on subjective self-report measures.", "Lack of control groups in most studies.", "EFT is consistently shown to be less effective than medication.", "The treatment is too time-consuming to be practical."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A common criticism is that many EFT studies rely heavily on subjective self-report measures, which can be influenced by bias."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing chronic lower back pain. Based on the research presented, what would be a reasonable expectation for pain reduction following EFT?",
            "options": ["Complete elimination of pain in all cases.", "A small, statistically insignificant reduction in pain.", "A moderate reduction in pain perception and improved functionality.", "No change in pain levels."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that EFT can lead to a moderate reduction in pain perception and improved functionality for chronic pain conditions, though complete elimination of pain is not guaranteed."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "What is publication bias, and how might it affect the conclusions drawn from meta-analyses of EFT?",
            "options": ["The tendency for studies with negative results to be published more often.", "The tendency for studies with statistically significant, positive results to be published more often.", "Bias introduced by researchers who are not experts in EFT.", "Bias resulting from the use of standardized EFT protocols."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Publication bias refers to the tendency for studies with statistically significant, positive results to be more likely to be published, potentially leading to an overestimation of EFT's effectiveness in meta-analyses."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "In performance enhancement research, what specific outcome has EFT been shown to improve, particularly in sports and business contexts?",
            "options": ["Increased physical strength.", "Reduced anxiety and improved focus.", "Enhanced memory recall.", "Improved sleep quality."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EFT has been shown to improve focus and reduce anxiety, thus improving performance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the purpose of critically appraising EFT research before integrating it into your practice?",
            "options": ["To ensure that the research confirms your pre-existing beliefs about EFT.", "To identify methodological flaws and assess the validity and reliability of the findings.", "To dismiss any research that does not support the use of EFT.", "To solely rely on research conducted by EFT experts."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Critically appraising research helps identify methodological flaws and assess the validity and reliability of the findings, allowing for informed decisions about integrating EFT into practice."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "You're working with 'Sarah,' a 35-year-old client with mild social anxiety. Based on evidence-based practice principles, what is the FIRST step you should take after gathering Sarah's history?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin applying a standardized EFT protocol.", "Search for relevant research on EFT for social anxiety.", "Administer a standardized anxiety assessment tool.", "Contact an EFT expert for consultation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Administering a standardized anxiety assessment tool is the first step to quantify the client's anxiety level before intervention, serving as a baseline for measuring progress."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A study claims that EFT is 100% effective for treating depression in adolescents. What methodological red flag should immediately raise concern about this claim?",
            "options": ["The study used a small sample size and lacked a control group.", "The study was published in a peer-reviewed journal.", "The study used standardized EFT protocols.", "The study involved certified EFT practitioners."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A study claiming 100% effectiveness, especially with a small sample size and no control group, is highly suspect and likely suffers from methodological flaws."
