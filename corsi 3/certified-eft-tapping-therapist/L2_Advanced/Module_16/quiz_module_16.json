            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the case study involving complex trauma and EFT, which specific aspect of trauma-informed care is MOST crucial when initially establishing rapport with the client?",
            "options": ["Immediately addressing the traumatic event details.", "Establishing a sense of safety and predictability in the therapeutic environment.", "Encouraging the client to confront their fears directly.", "Providing a detailed explanation of the EFT tapping sequence."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and predictability is paramount in trauma-informed care before delving into traumatic details. This approach aligns with research on trauma processing and client safety (van der Kolk, 2014)."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports a SUDs (Subjective Units of Distress Scale) rating of 8 before tapping. After one round of tapping on the statement 'Even though I have this pain...', their SUDs rating decreases to 5. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately move to a cognitive restructuring intervention.", "Continue tapping on the remaining aspects of the initial issue, focusing on the residual pain.", "Terminate the session, as significant progress has been made.", "Shift focus to a completely different problem area."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a SUDs reduction is positive, a rating of 5 indicates continued distress. The most appropriate step is to continue addressing the remaining aspects of the initial issue until a lower SUDs rating is achieved."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In using EFT for performance anxiety with high-achieving individuals, what is a common underlying belief that often contributes to their anxiety?",
            "options": ["A belief in their inherent inadequacy despite outward success.", "A lack of interest in achieving high standards.", "A strong support system that alleviates pressure.", "A realistic assessment of their capabilities."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High-achieving individuals often struggle with imposter syndrome and a deep-seated belief in their inadequacy, driving their performance anxiety. This is supported by studies on perfectionism and anxiety (Ferrari & Thompson, 2006)."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "You are working with a client who discloses they are also seeing another therapist for a similar issue. Which ethical consideration is MOST important to address?",
            "options": ["Immediately terminating your services to avoid conflict.", "Ensuring that both therapists are aware of each other and coordinating care with the client's consent.", "Ignoring the information, as it is the client's right to seek multiple opinions.", "Discouraging the client from seeing another therapist."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethically, it is crucial to ensure coordinated care with the client's consent when multiple therapists are involved. This promotes client well-being and avoids potential conflicts or duplication of services (Corey et al., 2019)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EFT for addictions focuses on addressing the emotional roots and triggers of the addictive behavior, aligning with a holistic approach that considers the psychological aspects of addiction (Stapleton, 2019)."

            "options": ["Encouraging them to immediately dispose of all items belonging to the deceased.", "Using EFT to address specific memories and emotions associated with the loss, focusing on acceptance and integration.", "Avoiding any discussion of the deceased to prevent further distress.", "Recommending medication as the primary course of treatment."],
