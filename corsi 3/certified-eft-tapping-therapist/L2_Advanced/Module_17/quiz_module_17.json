            "options": ["Directly targeting the traumatic memories.", "Using gentle techniques and focusing on present-day anxiety symptoms.", "Combining EFT with intense exposure therapy.", "Ignoring the trauma history and focusing solely on the panic attacks."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the trauma history, a gentle, trauma-informed approach is crucial to avoid retraumatization. Focusing on present-day anxiety symptoms allows the client to build safety and trust."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
