            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important element of informed consent in EFT practice?",
            "options": ["Providing a detailed explanation of EFT techniques.", "Ensuring the client understands the potential risks and benefits of EFT.", "Guaranteeing a specific outcome for the client.", "Minimizing the discussion of alternative therapies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires that the client understands the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to EFT. Guaranteeing outcomes is unethical and unrealistic."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, discloses to her EFT therapist that she is considering leaving her abusive partner. What is the therapist's ethical obligation regarding confidentiality?",
            "options": ["The therapist must maintain confidentiality, regardless of the situation.", "The therapist is obligated to report the situation to the authorities, breaching confidentiality.", "The therapist should encourage Sarah to stay in the relationship for the sake of her children.", "The therapist may need to breach confidentiality if Sarah is at imminent risk of harm, following legal and ethical guidelines."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is paramount, it is not absolute. If a client is at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others, therapists may have a duty to warn or protect, following legal and ethical guidelines."

            "question": "Dr. Ramirez is conducting research on the effectiveness of EFT for anxiety. According to ethical guidelines, what is the MOST important consideration when recruiting participants?",
            "options": ["Recruiting participants who are most likely to show positive results.", "Ensuring participants are fully informed about the study's purpose, procedures, and potential risks, and provide voluntary consent.", "Offering excessively large financial incentives to encourage participation.", "Withholding information about the control group to avoid bias."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In research, informed consent is paramount. Participants must be fully aware of the study's details and risks, and their participation must be voluntary. Large financial incentives can compromise voluntariness."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "What is a 'dual relationship' in the context of EFT practice, and why is it generally considered unethical?",
            "options": ["A therapeutic relationship where the therapist also provides financial advice.", "A relationship where the therapist and client have multiple roles, such as friends, business partners, or family members; it can compromise objectivity and exploit the client.", "A situation where the therapist uses two different EFT techniques in a session.", "A relationship where the therapist consults with another professional about the client's case."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships can blur boundaries, compromise the therapist's objectivity, and create a power imbalance that can be exploitative to the client. Maintaining professional boundaries is crucial."

            "options": ["Applying the same EFT techniques regardless of cultural differences.", "Seeking consultation, educating themselves about the client's culture, and adapting their approach to be culturally sensitive.", "Assuming the client's cultural beliefs are irrelevant to the therapy process.", "Avoiding working with clients from different cultural backgrounds."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural competence involves actively learning about and respecting clients' cultural backgrounds. Therapists should adapt their approach to be culturally sensitive and seek consultation when necessary."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client autonomy means respecting the client's right to make their own decisions. Making decisions *for* the client, even with good intentions, violates this principle."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "What is the primary purpose of having a clearly defined scope of practice for EFT therapists?",
            "options": ["To limit the number of clients an EFT therapist can see.", "To protect clients from harm by ensuring therapists only practice within their areas of competence.", "To increase the therapist's income by offering a wider range of services.", "To create competition among EFT therapists."],

            "explanation": "A clearly defined scope of practice protects clients by ensuring that therapists only offer services within their areas of competence, reducing the risk of harm or ineffective treatment."
