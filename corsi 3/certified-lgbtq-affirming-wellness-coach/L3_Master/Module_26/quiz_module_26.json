            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A needs assessment reveals that a significant portion of your target population experiences high rates of <span class=\"highlight\">social isolation</span>. Which program component would be MOST effective in addressing this issue?",
            "options": ["Individual therapy sessions focused on cognitive restructuring.", "Group-based activities and peer support networks.", "Educational workshops on stress management techniques.", "Referrals to external healthcare providers for medication management."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Group activities and peer support directly combat social isolation by fostering connections, shared experiences, and a sense of belonging, which are crucial for wellness within the LGBTQ+ community. A 2021 study in the *Journal of Community Psychology* showed group interventions reduced isolation by 30%."

            "options": ["Sustainability is less important than immediate impact, as short-term benefits are most valuable.", "Sustainability ensures the program can continue to serve the community over the long term.", "Sustainability primarily focuses on minimizing initial program costs.", "Sustainability is only relevant for programs funded by government grants."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability ensures the program's longevity, allowing it to continue providing support and resources to the LGBTQ+ community for years to come. This involves securing long-term funding, building partnerships, and developing internal capacity."

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A mixed-methods approach combines quantitative data (e.g., surveys, standardized assessments) with qualitative data (e.g., interviews, focus groups) to provide a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the program's impact. As demonstrated in a case study, combining quantitative measures of depression with qualitative narratives of lived experience, allowed for a richer understanding of the program's effect on mental well-being."

This is because community involvement ensures the program is culturally relevant, responsive to the community's needs, and fosters a sense of ownership."
