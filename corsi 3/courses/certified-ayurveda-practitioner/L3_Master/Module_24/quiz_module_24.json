            "question": "In advanced Nadi Vigyan, what does a 'leaping' pulse typically indicate?",
            "options": ["Vata imbalance", "Pitta imbalance", "Kapha imbalance", "Sama condition"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'leaping' pulse, characterized by its forceful and bounding nature, is a key indicator of Pitta imbalance. This is due to the increased heat and intensity associated with Pitta dosha."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on tongue diagnosis, what does a thick white coating on the posterior third of the tongue suggest?",
            "options": ["Dehydration", "Malabsorption or Ama accumulation in the colon", "Iron deficiency", "Excessive salivation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A thick white coating on the posterior third of the tongue often indicates malabsorption or the accumulation of Ama (undigested toxins) in the colon. This area corresponds to the lower digestive tract."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Which of the following herbal combinations is MOST appropriate for a patient exhibiting symptoms of high Vata with concurrent digestive weakness (agni mandya)?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha and Shatavari", "Trikatu and Dashamula", "Brahmi and Gotu Kola", "Arjuna and Amalaki"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trikatu (ginger, black pepper, and long pepper) stimulates digestion and alleviates Vata, while Dashamula balances Vata and supports overall strength. The other options are less directly targeted to both digestive weakness and Vata imbalance."

            "options": ["Increasing intake of dairy products and sweet fruits", "Focusing on light, warm, and dry foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes", "Consuming large meals at irregular intervals", "Prioritizing cold and heavy foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kapha is characterized by heaviness, coldness, and dampness. Therefore, a dietary strategy that emphasizes light, warm, and dry foods with pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes helps to counteract these qualities and restore balance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Katika Taruna Marma, located on the sacrum, is often addressed first in lower back pain cases. Releasing tension in this area can significantly improve energy flow and alleviate pain."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Emotional release during Panchakarma is common. The practitioner should provide emotional support, grounding techniques (like meditation or gentle massage), and adjust the treatment based on the patient's capacity to process the emotions. Stopping abruptly or ignoring the release could be detrimental."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the Vata imbalance (constipation, dry skin, anxiety, Vata pulse, cracked tongue), Basti therapy with medicated oils is the most appropriate initial treatment. It lubricates the colon, pacifies Vata, and helps alleviate constipation and anxiety. Dietary recommendations should support Vata pacification."
