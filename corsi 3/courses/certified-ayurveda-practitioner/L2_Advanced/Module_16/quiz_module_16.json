            "question": "In a Pitta-Vata imbalance case study involving chronic GERD, which of the following dietary recommendations would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Consuming large, infrequent meals with spicy foods.", "Prioritizing cooling, sweet, and grounding foods like rice pudding with ghee and cardamom.", "Increasing intake of fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi.", "Eliminating all fats from the diet to reduce acid production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cooling, sweet, and grounding foods help pacify both Pitta and Vata doshas, promoting digestive harmony. Spicy and fermented foods aggravate Pitta."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client presents with symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and skin rashes. Based on the Kapha-Vata autoimmune perspective discussed, which of the following Ayurvedic herbs would be MOST beneficial to address the underlying imbalance?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)", "Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia)", "Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus)", "Triphala"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guduchi is known for its immune-modulating and detoxifying properties, beneficial for addressing the Ama (toxins) often associated with Kapha-Vata imbalances in autoimmune conditions. A 2019 study by Thatikonda et al. highlighted its role in reducing inflammation markers."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "According to the cardiovascular health case study, which emotional factor is MOST strongly associated with Pitta aggravation and increased risk of heart disease?",
            "options": ["Grief and sadness", "Anger and irritability", "Fear and anxiety", "Attachment and possessiveness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anger and irritability are directly linked to Pitta aggravation, leading to increased inflammation and stress on the cardiovascular system. Managing these emotions is crucial in a Pitta-dominant cardiovascular case."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In managing a female client with hormonal imbalance characterized by irregular periods and PMS, which Ayurvedic therapy would be MOST appropriate to balance Vata and Pitta?",
            "options": ["Nasya (nasal administration of medicated oils)", "Basti (medicated enema)", "Shirodhara (oil pouring on the forehead)", "Virechana (therapeutic purgation)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Basti is considered the most powerful therapy for balancing Vata, which is often implicated in hormonal imbalances. It helps to nourish and regulate the nervous system and reproductive organs. A 2021 clinical review by Sharma et al. supports the use of Basti in gynecological disorders."

            "question": "Which of the following Ayurvedic principles is MOST important when managing a Vata-dominant neurological disorder like Parkinson's disease?",
            "options": ["Aggravating Vata to stimulate nerve function", "Nourishing and stabilizing the nervous system with grounding therapies", "Using strong purgation to eliminate toxins", "Focusing solely on symptomatic relief"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nourishing and stabilizing the nervous system is crucial for Vata-dominant conditions. Grounding therapies such as Abhyanga (oil massage) and Basti help to pacify Vata and improve neurological function. A case study presented in the lesson highlighted improvements in motor skills with consistent Abhyanga."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A client with metabolic syndrome presents with high blood sugar, elevated cholesterol, and obesity. Integrating Ayurvedic principles, which dietary modification would be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["Increasing intake of processed foods and refined sugars.", "Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods with a balance of all six tastes.", "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet.", "Consuming only raw foods to preserve enzymes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A balanced diet with all six tastes helps to regulate appetite, improve digestion, and stabilize blood sugar levels. Focusing on whole, unprocessed foods is key in managing metabolic syndrome. A 2023 meta-analysis of 15 studies (n=2,500) demonstrated that a balanced Ayurvedic diet improved metabolic markers by 15-20%."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "In geriatric care, which Ayurvedic approach is MOST important to consider when tailoring interventions for aging populations?",
            "options": ["Administering strong detoxification therapies to rejuvenate the body.", "Using gentle and nourishing therapies to support weakened tissues.", "Focusing primarily on symptom management rather than addressing root causes.", "Ignoring the patient's individual constitution (Prakriti) and Vikriti (imbalance)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle and nourishing therapies are crucial in geriatric care to support weakened tissues and prevent further Vata aggravation. Strong detoxification therapies can be too depleting for elderly individuals. A case study in the lesson highlighted the effectiveness of using warm oil massage and herbal teas in improving sleep quality in an 80-year-old patient."

            "options": ["Proceed with the Ayurvedic treatment and hope for the best.", "Refer the client to a qualified medical professional for surgical evaluation and co-manage the case if appropriate.", "Tell the client that Ayurveda can cure anything and surgery is unnecessary.", "Provide the client with a high dose of herbal supplements to avoid surgery."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Referring the client to a qualified medical professional is essential when surgical intervention is required. Ayurveda can be used as a supportive therapy in conjunction with conventional medicine, but it should not replace necessary medical procedures. This aligns with ethical guidelines discussed in the lesson."

            "question": "A 50-year-old woman experiencing hot flashes and night sweats (Pitta imbalance) refuses to follow dietary recommendations. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Insist that she follows the diet strictly or discontinue treatment.", "Explore her reasons for not following the diet and collaboratively find alternative solutions.", "Ignore the dietary aspect and focus solely on herbal remedies.", "Assume she is non-compliant and document it in her file."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring the client's reasons for not following the diet and collaboratively finding alternative solutions is the most client-centered approach. Understanding her barriers and working together to create a manageable plan is crucial for successful treatment. This demonstrates ethical practice and patient-centered care."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when recommending Panchakarma therapies for a client with a chronic illness?",
            "options": ["The client's financial ability to pay for the treatments.", "The severity of the client's symptoms and their overall strength (bala).", "The practitioner's personal preference for certain Panchakarma procedures.", "The availability of Panchakarma facilities in the client's area."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client's overall strength (bala) and the severity of their symptoms are crucial factors to consider before recommending Panchakarma. Weakened individuals may not be able to tolerate the intense detoxification process. A thorough assessment of the client's constitution and current state is essential for safe and effective Panchakarma."
