        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary challenge when integrating classical Ayurvedic texts with modern scientific research?",
            "options": ["The texts are too short.", "The texts are readily available in multiple languages.", "The language and concepts in classical texts often differ significantly from modern scientific terminology and methodologies.", "Modern scientific research always confirms the findings of classical texts."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Classical Ayurvedic texts use a different framework and language compared to modern science, making direct comparison and integration challenging."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "When evaluating the quality of research on Ayurvedic herbs, which aspect is MOST critical to consider regarding potential bias?",
            "options": ["The number of participants in the study.", "The type of statistical analysis used.", "The funding source and potential conflicts of interest.", "The publication date of the study."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Funding source and conflicts of interest can significantly influence research outcomes, potentially leading to biased results."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of <span class=\"highlight\">Ashwagandha</span> on stress levels reports a p-value of 0.06. How should an Ayurvedic practitioner interpret this result?",
            "options": ["The result is statistically significant, indicating a strong effect of Ashwagandha on stress.", "The result is not statistically significant at the conventional alpha level of 0.05, suggesting weak evidence of an effect.", "The result proves that Ashwagandha is ineffective for stress reduction.", "The result indicates a need for larger sample sizes but is clinically significant."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05, meaning the results are not statistically significant and the observed effect could be due to chance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the context of Ayurvedic research, what is the significance of understanding the concept of <span class=\"highlight\">'Agni'</span> in relation to digestion and metabolism?",
            "options": ["'Agni' is not relevant to modern research.", "Understanding 'Agni' allows researchers to translate classical concepts into measurable physiological parameters.", "The concept of 'Agni' is only important for classical Ayurvedic practice.", "Understanding 'Agni' helps in completely disregarding modern medicine."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding 'Agni' helps in translating classical concepts into measurable physiological parameters, bridging traditional knowledge with modern scientific inquiry and improving research design."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Client Priya, age 45, presents with symptoms of anxiety and insomnia. Based on Ayurvedic principles, her practitioner recommends a combination of <span class=\"highlight\">Brahmi</span> and <span class=\"highlight\">Yoga Nidra</span>. Which type of research would provide the MOST relevant evidence to support this intervention?",
            "options": ["In vitro studies on Brahmi's antioxidant activity.", "A randomized controlled trial comparing Brahmi and Yoga Nidra to a placebo for anxiety and insomnia.", "A historical analysis of the use of Brahmi in ancient Ayurvedic texts.", "An expert opinion piece on the benefits of Ayurvedic herbs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A randomized controlled trial is the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, providing the strongest evidence for clinical decision-making."

            "options": ["Wikipedia", "Google", "PubMed/MEDLINE", "A personal blog"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PubMed/MEDLINE is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including research on complementary and alternative medicine."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of conducting a critical appraisal of a research article?",
            "options": ["To find errors in the study and dismiss its findings.", "To assess the study's strengths and weaknesses and determine its validity and applicability to clinical practice.", "To summarize the study's findings for a general audience.", "To promote the study's findings to colleagues."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Critical appraisal involves systematically assessing the validity, reliability, and applicability of research evidence to inform clinical decision-making."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A study claims that a specific Ayurvedic treatment reduces <span class=\"highlight\">Vata</span> imbalance by 80% based on subjective reports from participants. What is the MOST important limitation to consider when interpreting this finding?",
            "options": ["The lack of statistical analysis.", "The reliance on subjective data, which may be influenced by placebo effects and reporting bias.", "The small sample size.", "The use of Ayurvedic terminology."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subjective data is prone to bias, and without objective measures, it's difficult to determine the true effect of the treatment."

            "options": ["Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Cohort study", "Case-control study", "Case report"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Case reports describe the experiences of a single patient or a small group of patients and cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships due to the lack of a control group and potential for confounding factors."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is a key consideration when translating the concept of <span class=\"highlight\">'Prakriti'</span> (individual constitution) into modern research methodologies?",
            "options": ["Prakriti is irrelevant to modern research.", "Identifying measurable biomarkers or physiological parameters that correlate with different Prakriti types.", "Ignoring the concept of Prakriti to simplify the research process.", "Using only subjective questionnaires to assess Prakriti."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Translating 'Prakriti' into modern research requires identifying objective measures that can differentiate individuals based on their constitutional types, allowing for personalized interventions and more precise research outcomes."
