            "question": "When supporting a child grieving the loss of a grandparent, which of the following statements is MOST important to avoid?",
            "options": ["\"It's okay to feel sad; grief is a natural emotion.\"", "\"Grandpa is in a better place now and no longer suffering.\"", "\"Let's draw a picture to remember all the fun things you did together.\"", "\"It's important to remember all the good times you shared.\""],

            "explanation": "Telling a child that the deceased is \"in a better place\" can be confusing and may not align with their understanding of death.
