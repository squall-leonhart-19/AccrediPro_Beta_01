      "question": "According to the P.E.A.C.E. Framework™, which element focuses on facilitating advance care planning and connecting clients with relevant resources?",
      "options": ["Presence & Perspective", "Exploration & Education", "Action & Advocacy", "Comfort & Connection"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 'Action & Advocacy' component of the P.E.A.C.E. Framework™ directly addresses facilitating advance care planning, connecting clients with resources, and advocating for their desired end-of-life experience."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_2",
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial response when a client expresses fear about the dying process?",
      "options": ["Immediately reassure them that everything will be alright.", "Explore the specific fears and concerns they have.", "Share your personal beliefs about death and dying.", "Redirect the conversation to a more positive topic."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Exploring the client's specific fears and concerns is the most appropriate initial response. This allows for a deeper understanding of their anxieties and provides an opportunity to address them with empathy and accurate information. Reassuring them without understanding their concerns can minimize their feelings."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_3",
      "question": "A client with terminal cancer expresses a desire to reconcile with their estranged sibling. What is the end-of-life doula's BEST course of action?",
      "options": ["Contact the sibling directly to arrange a meeting.", "Encourage the client to write a letter expressing their feelings.", "Facilitate a mediated conversation between the client and sibling, if desired by both parties.", "Discourage the reconciliation attempt to avoid potential emotional distress."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Facilitating a mediated conversation, if desired by both parties, is the most ethical and supportive approach. It respects the client's autonomy and provides a safe space for communication, while also considering the sibling's willingness to engage. Contacting the sibling directly without the client's consent would be a boundary violation."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_4",
      "question": "Which of the following is a key ethical consideration for end-of-life doulas?",
      "options": ["Providing medical advice to clients and their families.", "Maintaining strict confidentiality and respecting client autonomy.", "Imposing personal beliefs about death and dying on clients.", "Accepting gifts or financial incentives that could compromise objectivity."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Maintaining strict confidentiality and respecting client autonomy are fundamental ethical principles for end-of-life doulas. Providing medical advice is outside the scope of practice, and imposing personal beliefs or accepting inappropriate gifts can compromise the doula's objectivity and ethical integrity."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_5",
      "question": "What is the primary goal of legacy work in end-of-life care?",
      "options": ["To prolong the client's life as much as possible.", "To create a tangible or intangible representation of the client's life and values.", "To ensure the client's financial affairs are in order.", "To prepare the client for a specific religious afterlife."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Legacy work aims to help clients create something that represents their life, values, and experiences. This can take many forms, such as writing a memoir, creating a piece of art, or recording a video message for loved ones. It is not primarily focused on prolonging life, financial affairs, or religious beliefs."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_6",
      "question": "A client is experiencing significant anxiety and restlessness in their final days. Which non-pharmacological intervention is MOST likely to provide immediate comfort?",
      "options": ["Administering pain medication.", "Playing calming music and providing gentle touch.", "Encouraging strenuous physical activity.", "Initiating a deep discussion about their regrets."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Calming music and gentle touch are known to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. Pain medication is relevant for pain management, but not necessarily for anxiety. Strenuous activity is contraindicated, and discussing regrets might increase anxiety in the short term."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_7",
      "question": "What is the recommended approach for an end-of-life doula when a family member is exhibiting signs of complicated grief?",
      "options": ["Provide professional counseling directly to the family member.", "Encourage the family member to suppress their emotions and move on.", "Offer ongoing support and refer them to a qualified grief counselor or therapist.", "Dismiss their feelings as a normal part of the grieving process."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Offering ongoing support and referring to a qualified professional is the most appropriate approach. End-of-life doulas are not therapists and should not provide counseling. Complicated grief requires specialized intervention."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_8",
      "question": "Which of the following communication techniques is MOST effective for building rapport with a client who is withdrawn and unresponsive?",
      "options": ["Asking direct and probing questions.", "Maintaining a quiet presence and observing non-verbal cues.", "Sharing personal stories to establish common ground.", "Speaking loudly and clearly to ensure they can hear you."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Maintaining a quiet presence and observing non-verbal cues allows the doula to understand the client's needs and preferences without overwhelming them. Direct questions can be intrusive, and sharing personal stories might not be appropriate in this situation."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_9",
      "question": "When a client expresses uncertainty about their spiritual beliefs, what is the doula's role?",
      "options": ["To convert them to a specific religious faith.", "To provide a non-judgmental space for exploration and reflection.", "To dismiss their concerns as irrelevant.", "To impose their own spiritual beliefs on the client."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The doula's role is to provide a non-judgmental space for exploration and reflection, respecting the client's autonomy and spiritual journey. It is not the doula's place to convert, dismiss, or impose beliefs."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_10",
      "question": "What is the purpose of using assessment tools in end-of-life doula practice?",
      "options": ["To diagnose medical conditions.", "To evaluate the client's financial resources.", "To gather information and tailor interventions to the client's specific needs and preferences.", "To predict the client's exact time of death."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Assessment tools help doulas gather information about the client's physical, emotional, spiritual, and social needs, allowing them to develop a personalized care plan. They are not used for medical diagnosis, financial evaluation, or predicting time of death."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_11",
      "question": "A client's family is disagreeing about the level of medical intervention to pursue. What should the doula do?",
      "options": ["Take sides with the family member who agrees with the client's wishes.", "Facilitate a family meeting to encourage open communication and shared decision-making.", "Contact the client's physician and ask them to make the decision.", "Withdraw from the case to avoid conflict."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Facilitating a family meeting promotes open communication and allows the family to work towards a consensus that honors the client's wishes and values. Taking sides is unethical, and the physician should not make the decision without family input. Withdrawing is not a supportive response."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_12",
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a SMART goal in end-of-life care planning?",
      "options": ["To improve the client's quality of life.", "To reduce the client's pain.", "To have the client complete their advance directives within two weeks.", "To help the client feel more comfortable."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Completing advance directives within two weeks meets these criteria. The other options are too vague."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_13",
      "question": "What is the role of an end-of-life doula in managing a client's pain?",
      "options": ["To prescribe pain medication.", "To administer pain medication.", "To advocate for the client's pain management needs and offer comfort measures.", "To ignore the client's pain complaints."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "End-of-life doulas do not prescribe or administer medication. Their role is to advocate for the client's pain management, communicate with the medical team, and provide comfort measures like relaxation techniques and positioning."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_14",
      "question": "Which of the following is a potential benefit of offering group programs or workshops as an end-of-life doula?",
      "options": ["Increased isolation for clients.", "Decreased opportunities for professional development.", "Greater reach and efficiency in serving multiple clients.", "Reduced income potential."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Group programs and workshops allow doulas to serve multiple clients simultaneously, increasing their reach and efficiency. They also provide opportunities for peer support and shared learning."

      "options": ["Using aggressive sales tactics.", "Focusing solely on price competition.", "Highlighting your unique skills and the value you provide.", "Making unrealistic promises about client outcomes."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Highlighting your unique skills and the value you provide is crucial for attracting clients who are seeking personalized and compassionate care. Aggressive tactics and unrealistic promises are unethical and ineffective."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_16",
      "question": "What is the significance of 'presence' in the context of end-of-life doula work?",
      "options": ["Being physically present in the room.", "Actively listening, being fully engaged, and offering non-judgmental support.", "Providing medical interventions.", "Distracting the client from their emotions."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'Presence' in end-of-life doula work means being fully engaged with the client, actively listening to their concerns, and offering non-judgmental support. It goes beyond mere physical presence."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_17",
      "question": "A client is considering hospice care but is hesitant due to misconceptions. How should the doula address this?",
      "options": ["Dismiss their concerns and insist that hospice is the only option.", "Provide accurate information about hospice services and address their specific misconceptions.", "Tell them that hospice is only for people who are giving up.", "Avoid discussing hospice altogether."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Providing accurate information and addressing specific misconceptions is the most supportive and informative approach. It empowers the client to make an informed decision about their care."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_18",

      "options": ["Side with the family to maintain harmony.", "Advocate for the client's wishes while facilitating respectful communication with the family.", "Ignore the conflict and hope it resolves itself.", "Force the family to comply with the client's wishes."],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Advocating for the client's wishes while facilitating respectful communication is the ethical and compassionate approach. It respects the client's autonomy while acknowledging the family's concerns."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_19",
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT within the scope of practice for an end-of-life doula?",
      "options": ["Providing emotional support to the client and family.", "Facilitating legacy projects.", "Managing the client's financial affairs.", "Educating the client about end-of-life options."],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Managing a client's financial affairs is outside the scope of practice for an end-of-life doula. This requires specialized financial expertise and could create a conflict of interest."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_20",
