            "options": [
                "Providing medical advice and administering medications.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "End-of-life doulas primarily offer non-medical support. Providing medical advice, acting as a legal advocate, or making healthcare decisions are outside their scope of practice and potentially illegal."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a Living Will is legally binding, the client's current wishes should be respected. Encouraging an update allows their documented wishes to align with their present desires. Consulting the physician is also prudent."
