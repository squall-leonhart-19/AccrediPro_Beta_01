            "id": "q34_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial first step in designing an effective end-of-life group program?",
            "options": ["Securing a venue for the program.", "Conducting a thorough needs assessment of the target population.", "Developing a detailed marketing plan.", "Creating a budget for the program."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A needs assessment ensures the program addresses the specific needs and preferences of the intended participants, maximizing its relevance and impact. Prioritizing logistics or marketing before understanding needs can lead to a poorly designed program."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "A survey of 150 potential participants reveals that 75% are most interested in workshops addressing grief and bereavement. Based on this data, which curriculum development approach is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Focus solely on practical end-of-life planning, as this is a universal need.", "Allocate the majority of workshop time to grief and bereavement topics.", "Divide workshop time equally between all potential end-of-life topics.", "Ignore the survey data and develop a curriculum based on the facilitator's personal interests."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curriculum should be driven by identified needs. The survey data strongly indicates a high demand for grief and bereavement support, making it the most relevant focus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "During a workshop, a participant becomes visibly distressed and starts crying. What is the MOST appropriate immediate response from the facilitator?",
            "options": ["Immediately change the subject to lighten the mood.", "Publicly acknowledge the participant's distress and offer a group hug.", "Quietly approach the participant, offer support, and ask if they need a break or wish to speak privately.", "Ignore the participant and continue with the planned agenda to avoid disrupting the group."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing individual, compassionate support is essential. Publicly addressing the distress or ignoring the participant could be harmful. Changing the subject avoids addressing the participant's immediate needs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "Which of the following marketing strategies is MOST effective for reaching a local senior center with information about an end-of-life planning workshop?",
            "options": ["Posting flyers on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.", "Sending a mass email to a generic list of email addresses.", "Contacting the senior center director directly to offer a presentation or provide informational materials.", "Placing a small advertisement in a national magazine."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Direct outreach to the target audience through established channels (like a senior center) is more effective than broad, unfocused marketing efforts. Social media and national magazines may not reach the intended audience."

        {
            "id": "q34_5",
            "question": "To ensure accessibility, what is a crucial logistical consideration when choosing a venue for an end-of-life workshop?",
            "options": ["Ample parking and accessible restrooms.", "Proximity to public transportation only.", "Availability of childcare services.", "On-site catering services."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Accessibility is paramount. Ample parking and accessible restrooms are essential for accommodating participants with mobility limitations or other physical needs. While other options may be beneficial, accessibility is the most critical consideration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "Which evaluation method provides the MOST comprehensive understanding of a group program's impact on participants' well-being and coping skills?",
            "options": ["Counting the number of participants who attended each session.", "Administering pre- and post-program questionnaires measuring anxiety, depression, and sense of purpose.", "Asking participants for verbal feedback at the end of each session.", "Tracking the number of referrals generated by the program."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pre- and post-program questionnaires provide quantitative data on changes in key indicators of well-being and coping, offering a more objective and thorough evaluation than attendance counts or verbal feedback alone. Referrals are an indication of reach, not impact."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "A participant in a grief support group discloses that they are considering ending their life. What is the MOST ethical and appropriate course of action for the facilitator?",
            "options": ["Maintain confidentiality and encourage the participant to keep sharing their feelings.", "Immediately notify the police without informing the participant.", "Gently remind the participant of the group's confidentiality agreement and move on to the next person.", "Acknowledge the participant's distress, express concern, and follow established protocols for reporting suicidal ideation, ensuring the participant's safety while respecting their autonomy as much as possible."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Duty to protect overrides confidentiality when a participant is at risk of harming themselves. Following established protocols ensures responsible and ethical intervention while respecting the participant's rights."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of specialized group programs for specific populations (e.g., veterans, LGBTQ+ individuals) facing end-of-life issues?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the unique cultural and social contexts of the population to maintain a standardized approach.", "Tailoring the program content and facilitation style to address the specific needs, experiences, and cultural sensitivities of the population.", "Focusing solely on medical aspects of end-of-life care, neglecting psychosocial and spiritual needs.", "Excluding family members and caregivers to maintain group cohesion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Specialized programs must be culturally sensitive and tailored to the unique needs of the target population. Ignoring these factors can render the program ineffective or even harmful."

        {
            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 72, attends an end-of-life planning workshop and expresses frustration with complex legal documents. Which facilitation technique would be MOST helpful?",
            "options": ["Ignoring her frustration and moving on to the next topic.", "Providing a detailed lecture on estate law.", "Breaking down complex information into smaller, more manageable chunks and using visual aids.", "Dismissing her concerns as irrelevant."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Breaking down complex information and using visual aids caters to different learning styles and helps participants grasp challenging concepts more easily. Addressing her concerns directly, rather than ignoring or dismissing them, builds trust and encourages participation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "A post-program survey reveals that 30% of participants felt the workshop content was not relevant to their needs. What is the MOST appropriate next step for the doula?",
            "options": ["Disregard the feedback as statistically insignificant.", "Revise the needs assessment process to gather more accurate information about participant needs and preferences.", "Assume the participants were simply being difficult and continue with the existing curriculum.", "Immediately cancel all future workshops."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 30% dissatisfaction rate is significant and warrants investigation. Revising the needs assessment process ensures that future programs are better aligned with participant needs. Ignoring the feedback or canceling the program are not constructive responses."
