            "question": "Which of the following is a key principle of an adrenal-supporting diet?",
            "options": ["High intake of refined carbohydrates", "Regular consumption of processed foods", "Prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods", "Restricting sodium intake severely"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An adrenal-supporting diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods to provide essential nutrients and minimize stress on the body."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons, what is the primary reason blood sugar regulation is crucial for adrenal health?",
            "options": ["It directly stimulates cortisol production.", "It reduces the need for adrenal glands to function.", "Fluctuations in blood sugar can trigger the stress response and further burden the adrenal glands.", "It enhances the absorption of adrenal hormones."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unstable blood sugar levels activate the stress response system, leading to increased cortisol release and added strain on the adrenal glands."

            "question": "What is the recommended daily water intake for individuals supporting adrenal health, assuming no contraindications?",
            "options": ["Less than 1 liter", "Approximately 2-3 liters", "Approximately 5 liters", "Only when feeling thirsty"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adequate hydration, around 2-3 liters daily, supports various bodily functions, including adrenal hormone production and detoxification."

            "options": ["Processed meats", "Refined grains", "Leafy green vegetables", "Sugary drinks"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Leafy green vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support adrenal function and overall health."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Why should excessive caffeine consumption be limited or avoided when supporting adrenal health?",
            "options": ["It provides sustained energy without affecting the adrenal glands.", "It directly nourishes the adrenal glands.", "It can overstimulate the adrenal glands and lead to exhaustion.", "It helps regulate blood sugar levels."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Caffeine is a stimulant that can excessively activate the adrenal glands, potentially leading to fatigue and dysregulation over time."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing digestive issues when incorporating more fiber into their diet. Which strategy is MOST appropriate to address this challenge?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the increased fiber intake.", "Introduce high-fiber foods rapidly.", "Gradually increase fiber intake and ensure adequate hydration.", "Recommend a high-fiber supplement without dietary changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gradual increases in fiber, coupled with sufficient water intake, help the digestive system adapt and minimize discomfort."

            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates", "Increasing sugar intake", "Prioritizing protein and healthy fats at each meal", "Consuming only processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah's case study demonstrated that balancing blood sugar through protein and healthy fats was key to her improvement."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium plays a critical role in adrenal hormone production and stress response regulation. Chronic stress can deplete magnesium levels."

            "question": "What is the potential impact of chronic inflammation on adrenal health?",
            "options": ["It supports optimal adrenal function.", "It has no impact on adrenal function.", "It can exacerbate adrenal fatigue by increasing the demand for cortisol.", "It reduces the need for adrenal hormone production."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic inflammation puts additional stress on the body, requiring the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol, potentially leading to adrenal fatigue."
