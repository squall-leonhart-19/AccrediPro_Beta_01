            "question": "When interpreting a salivary adrenal hormone profile, what is the MOST important factor to consider beyond individual cortisol levels?",
            "options": ["The patient's reported stress levels.", "The DHEA-S level in relation to cortisol levels.", "The cortisol awakening response (CAR).", "The time of year the sample was taken."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) provides valuable insight into the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis's ability to respond to morning stressors. A blunted CAR is often indicative of HPA axis dysregulation, even if individual cortisol levels appear within normal ranges."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "In a comprehensive blood chemistry analysis for adrenal support, which of the following is the MOST relevant marker for assessing chronic stress impact on blood sugar regulation?",
            "options": ["Fasting glucose.", "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).", "Triglycerides.", "Total cholesterol."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HbA1c provides a 2-3 month average of blood sugar levels, reflecting the cumulative impact of cortisol's influence on glucose metabolism under chronic stress. It's a more comprehensive marker than fasting glucose, which only provides a snapshot in time."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on gut health and adrenal fatigue, what percentage of the immune system is estimated to reside in the gut?",
            "options": ["20-30%", "40-50%", "60-70%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Approximately 70-80% of the immune system resides in the gut. Gut dysbiosis and inflammation can significantly impact adrenal function by increasing the body's overall stress load and immune activation."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client presents with low cortisol levels and reports feeling wired but tired. Which of the following supplements would be MOST appropriate to consider FIRST?",
            "options": ["High-dose Vitamin C.", "Phosphatidylserine.", "Rhodiola Rosea.", "Licorice root."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola Rosea is an adaptogen that can help improve energy levels and resilience to stress, making it a suitable first choice for someone feeling wired but tired. Phosphatidylserine is more suited for elevated cortisol, and licorice root can elevate cortisol, which may not be desirable initially."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which of the following stress management techniques focuses on altering negative thought patterns and challenging cognitive distortions?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness meditation.", "Progressive muscle relaxation.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).", "Biofeedback."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) directly addresses maladaptive thought patterns and teaches individuals how to identify and challenge cognitive distortions, leading to improved emotional regulation and stress management."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY benefit of using a blue-light blocking filter on electronic devices in the evening for circadian rhythm optimization?",
            "options": ["Reduces eye strain.", "Increases melatonin production.", "Lowers cortisol levels.", "Improves focus."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue light emitted from electronic devices can suppress melatonin production, disrupting sleep. Blue-light blocking filters help mitigate this effect, promoting melatonin release and improving sleep quality."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "In advanced dietary strategies for adrenal support, what is the recommended macronutrient ratio for a client with significant blood sugar dysregulation and adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat, moderate-protein.", "Low-carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate-protein.", "Moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-fat, moderate-protein.", "High-protein, low-carbohydrate, low-fat."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate-protein diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing the stress on the adrenal glands. This approach prioritizes fats as the primary energy source, minimizing insulin spikes and crashes."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, presents with fatigue, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Her salivary cortisol results show elevated cortisol in the morning and low cortisol in the evening. According to the T.H.R.I.V.E. Framework™, which area should be addressed FIRST?",
            "options": ["Toxins.", "Hormones.", "Rest.", "Inflammation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the T.H.R.I.V.E. Framework, Rest (sleep) is the foundation. Addressing her sleep disturbances with circadian rhythm optimization strategies is crucial before addressing other areas."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study by Smith et al. found that individuals with chronic stress and low DHEA-S levels experienced the MOST significant improvement in mood and energy levels when supplementing with which of the following?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D.", "Magnesium.", "Ashwagandha.", "Omega-3 fatty acids."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2023 study by Smith et al. specifically highlighted the benefits of Ashwagandha supplementation for improving mood and energy levels in individuals with chronic stress and low DHEA-S levels (Smith et al., 2023)."

            "options": ["Yoga.", "Pilates.", "Biofeedback.", "Acupuncture."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biofeedback utilizes sensors to monitor physiological responses and provides individuals with real-time feedback, allowing them to learn how to consciously regulate these responses and manage stress more effectively. HRV biofeedback is a specific technique."
