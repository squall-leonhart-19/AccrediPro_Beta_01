            "question": "Which of the following supplements is MOST likely to be beneficial for supporting adrenal function by directly influencing cortisol production?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Magnesium", "Phosphatidylserine", "Rhodiola Rosea"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phosphatidylserine (PS) has been shown to help lower cortisol levels, particularly in response to stress. While other supplements support adrenal function, PS has a more direct impact on cortisol."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client reports difficulty falling asleep and waking up early. Which circadian rhythm optimization strategy should be prioritized FIRST?",
            "options": ["Melatonin supplementation", "Blue light blocking glasses in the evening", "Strict sleep schedule", "Bright light exposure in the morning"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Bright light exposure in the morning helps to entrain the circadian rhythm, signaling the body to wake up and setting the stage for better sleep later. While the other options are helpful, morning light is the foundational strategy."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced stress management techniques is MOST effective at addressing deeply ingrained, unconscious stress patterns?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness meditation", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)", "Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "EMDR is specifically designed to address trauma and deeply rooted emotional patterns by processing traumatic memories, making it more effective for unconscious stress patterns than other techniques."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "In a client with suspected adrenal fatigue, which lab result pattern would be MOST indicative of HPA axis dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Elevated morning cortisol, low DHEA-S", "Normal cortisol levels throughout the day", "High evening cortisol, low morning cortisol", "Low cortisol levels at all times of the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A high evening cortisol level combined with a low morning cortisol level is a classic sign of a disrupted cortisol rhythm, indicating HPA axis dysregulation."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client with both adrenal fatigue and Hashimoto's thyroiditis is experiencing persistent fatigue despite thyroid hormone optimization. Which nutritional deficiency is MOST likely contributing to their fatigue?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin B12"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency is common in individuals with Hashimoto's and can exacerbate fatigue. Addressing iron levels is crucial in co-morbid cases like this."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on gut health and inflammation, which dietary strategy is MOST effective for reducing intestinal permeability ('leaky gut')?",
            "options": ["High-fiber diet", "Low-fat diet", "Elimination diet followed by strategic reintroduction", "Increased intake of processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet followed by strategic reintroduction helps identify and remove trigger foods that contribute to intestinal permeability, promoting gut healing."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia. Her DUTCH test reveals low cortisol throughout the day and elevated epinephrine and norepinephrine. Applying the THRIVE framework, which area should be addressed FIRST?",
            "options": ["Toxicity", "Hormones", "Resilience", "Inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated epinephrine and norepinephrine indicate a highly stressed nervous system. Therefore, prioritizing Resilience (stress management and nervous system regulation) is the most appropriate initial step in Sarah's case."

            "id": "q12_8",

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client is taking adaptogens to support adrenal function but reports feeling more anxious. Which is the MOST likely explanation?",
            "options": ["The adaptogens are not working", "The client is taking too low of a dose", "The adaptogen is too stimulating for the client's current state", "Adaptogens always cause anxiety initially"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Some adaptogens can be stimulating. If a client is already in a heightened state of anxiety, a stimulating adaptogen may exacerbate their symptoms. Choosing a calming adaptogen or starting with a very low dose is crucial."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client's lab results show elevated levels of inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) despite following an anti-inflammatory diet. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Increase the dosage of their supplements", "Prescribe anti-inflammatory medication", "Investigate potential hidden sources of inflammation (e.g., infections, mold)", "Recommend a stricter diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent inflammation despite dietary changes suggests an underlying cause that needs to be identified and addressed. Hidden infections or environmental toxins like mold can be significant contributors."
