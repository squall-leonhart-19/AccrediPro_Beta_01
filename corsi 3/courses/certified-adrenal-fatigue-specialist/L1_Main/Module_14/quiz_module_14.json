        {
            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "When interpreting salivary adrenal hormone testing, what is the MOST important factor to consider beyond individual cortisol values?",
            "options": ["The absolute value of the morning cortisol.", "The DHEA-S level.", "The cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal slope.", "The patient's age."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal slope provide critical information about the HPA axis's overall function and resilience to stress, often more informative than a single cortisol measurement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue, low libido, and difficulty concentrating. Their DHEA-S level is significantly below the reference range. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescription DHEA supplementation at a high dose.", "Address potential underlying chronic inflammation or infection.", "Recommend high-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Ignore the DHEA-S value as it's not directly related to adrenal fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low DHEA-S often indicates chronic stress or underlying health issues. Addressing inflammation or infection is crucial before considering DHEA supplementation, which should be carefully monitored."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to case studies presented, which nutritional strategy is MOST effective for supporting adrenal function in clients with blood sugar dysregulation?",
            "options": ["A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.", "Frequent, small meals with balanced macronutrient ratios.", "Intermittent fasting with a ketogenic diet.", "A very low-protein, high-fiber diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequent, small meals with balanced macronutrient ratios help stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing stress on the adrenal glands. This approach is consistently demonstrated as effective in case studies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements is LEAST likely to be beneficial for adrenal support and may even exacerbate symptoms in some individuals?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha.", "Rhodiola Rosea.", "Licorice root.", "High-dose caffeine."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While caffeine can provide a temporary boost, it ultimately taxes the adrenal glands and can worsen adrenal fatigue symptoms in the long run. Adaptogens like Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, and Licorice root are generally more supportive."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Beyond basic mindfulness, what advanced stress reduction technique focuses on retraining the nervous system's response to stress through targeted exercises?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation.", "Biofeedback.", "Autogenic training.", "Guided imagery."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biofeedback provides real-time feedback on physiological parameters like heart rate variability, allowing individuals to consciously learn to regulate their stress response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "What advanced circadian rhythm optimization strategy is MOST effective for clients struggling with delayed sleep phase syndrome?",
            "options": ["Taking melatonin only in the morning.", "Bright light therapy in the evening.", "Consistent exposure to bright light in the morning and limiting blue light exposure in the evening.", "Avoiding all light exposure after sunset."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Morning bright light exposure helps shift the circadian rhythm earlier, while limiting evening blue light minimizes disruption. This is a cornerstone of managing delayed sleep phase syndrome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A client's salivary cortisol test reveals elevated evening cortisol. Further testing suggests a possible chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. What is the MOST appropriate initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescribe antiviral medication immediately.", "Recommend high-dose vitamin C and zinc, alongside targeted antiviral herbs.", "Ignore the EBV finding and focus solely on adrenal support.", "Advise the client to significantly increase their exercise intensity."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supporting the immune system with targeted nutrients and herbs is a gentler and often more effective initial approach than aggressive antiviral medication, especially in the context of adrenal fatigue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In a case study, a client with long-term adrenal fatigue experienced a significant improvement in energy levels and sleep quality after addressing which underlying infection?",
            "options": ["Candida overgrowth.", "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).", "Helicobacter pylori infection.", "All of the above."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While the specific infection varies, case studies highlight the importance of investigating and addressing underlying infections (Candida, SIBO, H. pylori) as potential drivers of adrenal dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "When designing a long-term management strategy for adrenal fatigue, what is the MOST important factor to consider for sustained success?",
            "options": ["Aggressive supplementation with high doses of adaptogens.", "Strict adherence to a rigid diet plan.", "Regular reassessment of HPA axis function and individualized adjustments to the treatment plan.", "Eliminating all sources of stress from the client's life."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adrenal fatigue is a dynamic condition. Regular reassessment and individualized adjustments are essential to ensure the treatment plan remains effective and addresses the client's evolving needs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of adrenal fatigue and reports using St. John's Wort for mild depression. What potential interaction should you be MOST concerned about?",
            "options": ["Increased cortisol levels.", "Decreased DHEA-S levels.", "Reduced effectiveness of adaptogenic herbs.", "St. John's Wort's potential to induce CYP450 enzymes, affecting the metabolism of other medications and supplements."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is a known CYP450 inducer, potentially altering the metabolism and efficacy of other medications and supplements the client may be taking. This is a critical consideration for safety and effectiveness."
