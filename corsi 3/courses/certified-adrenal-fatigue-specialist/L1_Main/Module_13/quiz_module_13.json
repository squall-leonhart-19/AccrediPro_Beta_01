            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metric is MOST indicative of parasympathetic nervous system activity and considered a key indicator of resilience to stress?",
            "options": ["LF/HF Ratio", "SDNN", "RMSSD", "Total Power"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) reflects short-term HRV and is primarily influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system, making it a sensitive marker of vagal tone and adaptability to stress."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client reports feeling most energetic between 10 AM and 12 PM and experiences a significant energy dip around 3 PM. Based on this information, which chronotype is the client MOST likely exhibiting?",
            "options": ["Lion (Early Bird)", "Wolf (Night Owl)", "Bear (Typical)", "Dolphin (Erratic)",],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Bear' chronotype typically aligns with the solar cycle and experiences peak energy during mid-morning followed by a mid-afternoon dip. This is the most common chronotype."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which of the following nutritional strategies is MOST directly aimed at modulating the gut-adrenal axis by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing intestinal permeability?",
            "options": ["Following a ketogenic diet", "Supplementing with high doses of vitamin C", "Increasing intake of prebiotic and probiotic-rich foods", "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prebiotics and probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome, which can reduce inflammation and improve adrenal function by influencing the HPA axis via the gut-adrenal axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which adaptogen is known for its potential to enhance cognitive function, reduce mental fatigue, and protect against stress-induced neuronal damage, making it particularly useful for clients experiencing brain fog?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Holy Basil (Ocimum sanctum)", "Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola Rosea has demonstrated neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing effects in several studies, making it a strong choice for clients struggling with brain fog related to adrenal fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "According to the Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the vagus nerve is associated with social engagement, feelings of safety, and the ability to connect with others?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Pathway", "Ventral Vagal Pathway", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Parasympathetic Nervous System"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Pathway is responsible for social engagement, communication, and feelings of safety and connection. Activating this pathway is crucial for stress resilience and emotional regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "A post-menopausal woman experiencing adrenal fatigue symptoms is considering Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). What is a PRIMARY consideration regarding HRT in the context of adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["HRT should always be avoided in cases of adrenal fatigue.", "HRT will directly resolve adrenal fatigue.", "HRT may exacerbate adrenal fatigue if adrenal function is not adequately supported.", "HRT is a first-line treatment for adrenal fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introducing HRT without addressing underlying adrenal dysfunction can place further stress on the adrenal glands, potentially worsening symptoms. It's crucial to optimize adrenal function before or concurrent with HRT."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Besides cortisol, which of the following hormones is MOST important to assess when evaluating adrenal function due to its role in regulating sodium and potassium balance, and its potential impact on blood pressure?",
            "options": ["Insulin", "DHEA-S", "Aldosterone", "Estrogen"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aldosterone, produced by the adrenal cortex, regulates electrolyte balance. Imbalances can lead to symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and blood pressure fluctuations, making it a crucial marker in adrenal assessment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the THRIVE framework, what does the 'I' represent, and how does it contribute to personalized treatment protocols for adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Immunity, focusing on immune-modulating interventions", "Inflammation, addressing chronic inflammation through diet and lifestyle", "Integration, emphasizing the importance of integrating various treatment modalities", "Insights, using advanced lab testing to gain deeper insights into the client's condition"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'I' in THRIVE stands for Integration, highlighting the need to combine different treatment approaches (e.g., nutrition, stress management, supplementation) for optimal results and a holistic approach to adrenal fatigue management."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of childhood trauma exhibits heightened sensitivity to stress and frequent activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Which intervention, informed by trauma-informed care principles, would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encouraging vigorous exercise to 'burn off' stress hormones", "Implementing grounding techniques and mindfulness practices to promote feelings of safety", "Recommending aggressive supplementation to 'boost' adrenal function", "Pushing the client to confront past traumas directly"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques and mindfulness practices help regulate the nervous system and promote a sense of safety, crucial for clients with trauma histories who may experience heightened stress responses and difficulty regulating emotions."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 45-year-old client, presents with persistent fatigue, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. Her lab results show elevated evening cortisol levels and low DHEA-S. Based on this information and the concepts covered in this module, what is the MOST appropriate initial step in her personalized protocol?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting HRT to balance hormone levels", "Implementing sleep hygiene strategies and stress-reducing techniques to regulate cortisol rhythm", "Prescribing high-dose stimulants to combat fatigue", "Ignoring the cortisol levels and focusing solely on DHEA-S supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated evening cortisol suggests a disrupted circadian rhythm. Addressing sleep hygiene and stress through techniques like mindfulness and relaxation exercises is a crucial first step to re-establish a healthy cortisol pattern before considering other interventions."
