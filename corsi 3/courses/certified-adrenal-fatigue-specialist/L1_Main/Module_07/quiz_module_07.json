            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary interaction between the adrenal glands and the thyroid gland?",
            "options": ["The adrenal glands directly stimulate TSH production.", "Cortisol inhibits the conversion of T4 to T3.", "Thyroid hormones directly regulate cortisol synthesis.", "Adrenal hormones have no significant impact on thyroid function."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cortisol, when elevated, can inhibit the enzyme 5'-deiodinase, which is responsible for converting inactive T4 into active T3, thus impacting thyroid hormone activity. This is a crucial aspect of the adrenal-thyroid axis interplay."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of individuals with chronic inflammation also exhibit signs of adrenal dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Between 50% and 70%", "Over 90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that a significant portion (50-70%) of individuals with chronic inflammatory conditions also show signs of adrenal fatigue or dysregulation, highlighting the strong link between inflammation and adrenal health."

        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with persistent fatigue, digestive issues, and anxiety. Based on the Gut-Adrenal Connection lesson, which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Prescribe a high-dose cortisol supplement.", "Implement a comprehensive gut healing protocol focusing on removing inflammatory foods and supporting beneficial bacteria.", "Recommend intense aerobic exercise to boost energy levels.", "Advise her to ignore the gut symptoms as they are likely unrelated to her fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the bidirectional relationship between the gut and adrenal glands, addressing gut health through dietary changes and probiotic support is a crucial first step in supporting adrenal function and reducing inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements is MOST directly associated with supporting the HPA axis by modulating cortisol levels, as discussed in the Advanced Supplementation Strategies lesson?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Magnesium", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola Rosea is an adaptogen known for its ability to help the body adapt to stress by modulating cortisol levels and supporting overall HPA axis function. Studies have shown it can reduce fatigue and improve mental performance under stress."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Why is supporting the liver's detoxification pathways crucial for adrenal recovery?",
            "options": ["The liver directly stimulates cortisol production.", "The liver breaks down excess hormones and toxins that can burden the adrenal glands.", "Liver detoxification has no impact on adrenal function.", "The liver is the primary site of thyroid hormone conversion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The liver plays a vital role in detoxifying the body, including breaking down excess hormones and metabolic waste. When the liver is overburdened, these toxins can accumulate and further stress the adrenal glands, hindering recovery."

        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which of the following sleep hygiene practices has been shown to have the MOST significant impact on cortisol regulation and sleep quality?",
            "options": ["Drinking caffeine before bed.", "Using electronic devices right before sleep.", "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule.", "Taking a long afternoon nap."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule helps to regulate the body's natural circadian rhythm, which in turn regulates cortisol secretion and promotes better sleep quality. Disruptions to this rhythm can exacerbate adrenal fatigue symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and stressed despite following a healthy diet and supplement regimen. Which mind-body technique would be MOST appropriate to recommend initially?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Vigorous yoga", "Diaphragmatic breathing exercises", "Marathon running"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing is a simple yet powerful technique that activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. It is often the most accessible and effective initial mind-body intervention for stress reduction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In the THRIVE framework, what does the 'T' stand for?",
            "options": ["Thyroid Support", "Targeted Testing", "Trauma Resolution", "Toxin Elimination"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the THRIVE framework, 'T' stands for Toxin Elimination, emphasizing the importance of reducing exposure to environmental and internal toxins that can contribute to adrenal fatigue."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "According to the case studies presented, what was a common outcome observed after implementing personalized protocols addressing adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Immediate and complete resolution of all symptoms within one week.", "Gradual improvement in energy levels, mood, and stress resilience over several weeks to months.", "No noticeable change in symptoms.", "Worsening of symptoms due to increased awareness of stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case studies consistently demonstrated that personalized protocols, including dietary modifications, supplementation, stress management, and lifestyle adjustments, led to gradual improvements in energy levels, mood, and stress resilience over time, rather than immediate cures."

            "question": "A client, John, 50, is experiencing sleep disturbances and elevated evening cortisol levels. His initial cortisol awakening response (CAR) test also shows a blunted response. Which combination of interventions would be MOST appropriate based on the module's teachings?",
            "options": ["High-intensity exercise in the evening, caffeine before bed, and ignoring the CAR results.", "Light therapy in the morning, adaptogenic herbs in the evening, stress reduction techniques, and addressing gut health.", "Completely avoiding stress, taking high doses of stimulants, and eating a diet high in processed foods.", "Prescribing a strong sedative and advising him to avoid all physical activity."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Light therapy helps regulate the circadian rhythm, adaptogenic herbs can modulate cortisol levels, stress reduction techniques address the root cause, and addressing gut health supports overall well-being, making this a holistic and evidence-based approach to John's situation."
