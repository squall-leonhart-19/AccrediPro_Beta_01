            "options": ["Implementing a strict ketogenic diet.", "Assessing current sleep patterns and identifying sleep disruptors.", "Prescribing melatonin supplementation.", "Recommending high-intensity interval training."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing sleep patterns is crucial for understanding the client's baseline and identifying specific areas to address. This aligns with the assessment phase discussed in Lesson 2."

            "question": "A client reports consistently waking up between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM, feeling anxious. According to the principles discussed in this module, this pattern is MOST likely related to:",
            "options": ["A magnesium deficiency.", "Circadian rhythm disruption and potential cortisol surge.", "Sleep apnea.", "An overly stimulating sleep environment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Waking between 3:00-4:00 AM is often associated with a cortisol surge, impacting sleep maintenance. This relates to Lesson 4 on circadian rhythms and cortisol patterns."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to research presented in Lesson 5, which of the following stress reduction techniques has demonstrated the MOST significant impact on improving sleep quality in individuals with chronic stress?",
            "options": ["Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR).", "Mindfulness meditation.", "Deep breathing exercises.", "Visualization techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation, as discussed in Lesson 5, has shown significant benefits in reducing stress and improving sleep quality in research studies, often outperforming other relaxation techniques."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Which of the following strategies is LEAST likely to improve sleep hygiene?",
            "options": ["Establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule.", "Using electronic devices (phones, tablets) in bed before sleep.", "Creating a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment.", "Avoiding caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using electronic devices before sleep exposes individuals to blue light, which can suppress melatonin production and disrupt sleep. This is covered in Lesson 3."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, reports difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. She exercises vigorously in the evenings. Based on the information in Lesson 6, what recommendation is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Continue the vigorous evening exercise as it helps with calorie burning.", "Switch to gentle movement, like yoga or walking, earlier in the day.", "Increase exercise intensity to tire her out more.", "Take a pre-workout supplement to improve sleep quality."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vigorous exercise close to bedtime can be stimulating and interfere with sleep. Gentle movement earlier in the day is a better approach for adrenal support and sleep improvement, as discussed in Lesson 6."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which of the following nutritional strategies is MOST likely to promote restful sleep?",
            "options": ["Consuming a large, high-protein meal right before bed.", "Incorporating complex carbohydrates in the evening meal.", "Drinking a sugary beverage before bed to increase serotonin.", "Avoiding all carbohydrates in the evening to prevent blood sugar spikes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex carbohydrates can aid in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that promotes relaxation and sleep. This is discussed in Lesson 7."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client states, 'I know I need to rest, but I just don't have time!' What is the MOST effective strategy for integrating restorative practices into their daily routine, as discussed in Lesson 8?",
            "options": ["Schedule a 3-hour block of time each weekend for rest and relaxation.", "Start with small, manageable restorative practices (e.g., 5-minute breathing exercises) and gradually increase duration.", "Immediately eliminate all non-essential activities from their schedule.", "Suggest quitting their job to reduce stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with small, manageable practices is more sustainable and achievable for busy individuals. Gradual integration is key to long-term adherence, as highlighted in Lesson 8."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which hormone plays the MOST significant role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle?",
            "options": ["Insulin.", "Cortisol.", "Melatonin.", "Ghrelin."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is the primary hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles by signaling darkness and promoting sleepiness. This is discussed in Lesson 4."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "According to the lessons, what is the recommended room temperature range for optimal sleep?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A slightly cooler room temperature, around 60-67°F (16-19°C), is generally recommended for optimal sleep as it helps regulate the body's core temperature. This is covered in Lesson 3."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST reflects the relationship between exercise intensity and adrenal fatigue recovery?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is always the best choice for boosting energy levels.", "Moderate-intensity exercise can be beneficial, while excessive high-intensity exercise can exacerbate adrenal fatigue.", "Any form of exercise is detrimental to adrenal fatigue recovery.", "The more intense the exercise, the faster the recovery from adrenal fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moderate-intensity exercise supports adrenal function, while excessive high-intensity exercise can place further stress on the adrenal glands. This is a key principle discussed in Lesson 6."
