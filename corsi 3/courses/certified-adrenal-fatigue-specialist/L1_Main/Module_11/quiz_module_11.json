            "question": "Which of the following advanced sleep hygiene strategies is MOST effective for addressing late-night cortisol spikes, according to the lesson on advanced sleep hygiene?",
            "options": ["Using blue light blocking glasses only after 8 PM.", "Implementing a consistent sleep-wake schedule, even on weekends.", "Consuming a high-carbohydrate snack before bed.", "Engaging in intense exercise in the evening."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A consistent sleep-wake schedule helps regulate the circadian rhythm and can mitigate late-night cortisol spikes. Studies show that irregular sleep patterns disrupt cortisol secretion. The other options can negatively impact sleep quality and cortisol levels."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client presents with adrenal fatigue and reports experiencing anxiety. Which adaptogenic herb would be MOST appropriate to consider FIRST, based on the 'Deep Dive into Adaptogenic Herbs' lesson?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Eleuthero", "Schisandra"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is often preferred initially due to its calming properties, which can help reduce anxiety. While other adaptogens have benefits, Ashwagandha is generally better tolerated for anxiety. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine demonstrated Ashwagandha's efficacy in reducing anxiety and stress."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY goal of advanced nutritional strategies for blood sugar balance in adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["To completely eliminate carbohydrates from the diet.", "To stabilize blood sugar levels and minimize fluctuations.", "To promote rapid weight loss.", "To induce ketosis for energy production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to stabilize blood sugar to reduce stress on the adrenal glands. Fluctuations in blood sugar can trigger cortisol release, exacerbating adrenal fatigue. A balanced intake of complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats is crucial."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which advanced stress reduction technique focuses on altering one's perception of a stressor rather than eliminating the stressor itself?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness meditation", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "Cognitive reframing", "Deep breathing exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing involves changing the way one thinks about a stressful situation, which can reduce its impact. This technique is particularly useful for stressors that cannot be avoided. A study in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology found that cognitive reframing effectively reduces stress and anxiety."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "According to the module on advanced hydration, what is the MOST accurate way to assess individual electrolyte needs beyond simply measuring water intake?",
            "options": ["Tracking urine color throughout the day.", "Monitoring thirst levels.", "Using a comprehensive electrolyte panel blood test.", "Calculating electrolyte needs based on body weight alone."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive electrolyte panel provides the most accurate assessment of individual electrolyte levels and needs. While urine color and thirst can provide some indication, they are not as precise as a blood test. The lesson emphasized the importance of individualized approaches to electrolyte replacement."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "In advanced lab testing interpretation, what is a potential pitfall of relying solely on a single cortisol measurement taken at one point during the day?",
            "options": ["It accurately reflects the overall cortisol production throughout the day.", "It can be influenced by acute stress or other factors, leading to a misleading result.", "It is always the most cost-effective way to assess adrenal function.", "It eliminates the need for further testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A single cortisol measurement may not accurately represent the overall cortisol production due to diurnal variation and the influence of acute stressors. The module emphasized the importance of assessing the cortisol curve throughout the day using multiple samples or salivary testing. Studies suggest that single-point measurements can have up to a 30% variability."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "In the advanced case study analysis, a client presented with both adrenal fatigue and symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism. What was the FIRST recommended step in addressing this complex presentation?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting the client on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.", "Addressing adrenal function FIRST before evaluating thyroid function.", "Ignoring the thyroid symptoms and focusing solely on adrenal support.", "Prescribing high doses of iodine to stimulate thyroid hormone production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study emphasized that addressing adrenal function first is crucial because adrenal insufficiency can impact thyroid hormone conversion and utilization. Supporting the adrenals can often improve thyroid function without the immediate need for thyroid hormone replacement. This approach prevents further stress on the body."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, experienced significant improvement in her adrenal fatigue symptoms using the THRIVE framework. However, after 6 months, she reports a relapse. Which aspect of the THRIVE framework is MOST likely being neglected?",
            "options": ["Targeted supplementation", "Hormone regulation", "Restorative sleep", "Individualized lifestyle management"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Relapse often indicates a lack of sustained lifestyle management. While supplements and hormone regulation are important, long-term sustainability depends on consistently applying healthy habits. The THRIVE framework emphasizes individualized approaches to lifestyle management for long-term success."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which advanced hydration strategy is MOST effective for individuals experiencing orthostatic hypotension due to adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Drinking large amounts of water at once.", "Consuming caffeinated beverages regularly.", "Increasing sodium intake strategically throughout the day.", "Avoiding electrolytes to prevent fluid retention."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Strategic sodium intake helps increase blood volume and can alleviate orthostatic hypotension. Adrenal fatigue can impair aldosterone production, leading to sodium loss. The lesson highlighted the importance of personalized electrolyte strategies based on individual needs."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis showed that combining adaptogens with which other intervention resulted in the greatest reduction in perceived stress scores?",
            "options": ["Strict ketogenic diet", "High-intensity interval training", "Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs", "Intermittent fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2023 meta-analysis cited in the lesson indicated that combining adaptogens with mindfulness-based stress reduction programs yielded the most significant reduction in perceived stress scores. The synergistic effect of these two interventions was highlighted as a key strategy for managing stress in individuals with adrenal fatigue."
