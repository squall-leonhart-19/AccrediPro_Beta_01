            "question": "Which of the following is considered a foundational supplement for adrenal support, primarily aimed at replenishing depleted reserves and supporting adrenal hormone production?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea", "Vitamin C", "Licorice Root", "Phosphatidylserine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is a crucial nutrient for adrenal gland function, acting as an antioxidant and supporting cortisol production. Studies have shown that individuals under chronic stress often have depleted Vitamin C levels, making supplementation beneficial."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic fatigue, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Her cortisol levels are elevated in the evening. Which adaptogenic herb might be MOST appropriate to help regulate her cortisol rhythm?",
            "options": ["Eleuthero", "Ashwagandha", "Ginseng", "Rhodiola Rosea"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha has been shown in studies to help lower cortisol levels and promote relaxation, making it suitable for individuals with elevated evening cortisol and anxiety."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which targeted supplement is often recommended for individuals experiencing adrenal imbalances characterized by low cortisol levels and fatigue, particularly in the morning?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "DHEA", "GABA", "5-HTP"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DHEA is a precursor hormone that can support cortisol production and energy levels, particularly when adrenal function is compromised. However, it's important to monitor hormone levels under professional guidance."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which lifestyle modification is MOST crucial for optimizing circadian rhythm and improving adrenal health?",
            "options": ["Eating a large meal before bed", "Exercising vigorously in the evening", "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule", "Drinking caffeine throughout the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule helps regulate the body's natural cortisol rhythm and promotes restful sleep, which is essential for adrenal recovery. Disrupted sleep patterns can exacerbate adrenal fatigue."

        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to research on the gut-adrenal axis, what type of dietary intervention is MOST likely to support a healthy gut microbiome and, consequently, improve adrenal function?",
            "options": ["A diet high in processed foods", "A diet rich in refined sugars", "A diet low in fiber", "A diet rich in prebiotics and probiotics"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in prebiotics and probiotics nourishes beneficial gut bacteria, which can reduce inflammation, improve nutrient absorption, and positively impact adrenal health. The gut microbiome plays a significant role in regulating the body's stress response."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which mind-body technique is MOST effective at reducing stress and promoting relaxation, thereby indirectly supporting adrenal recovery?",
            "options": ["Watching television", "Engaging in social media", "Practicing mindfulness meditation", "Checking emails frequently"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce cortisol levels, improve mood, and promote a sense of calm, making it a valuable tool for managing stress and supporting adrenal health. Studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which detoxification strategy is MOST appropriate for supporting the body's natural cleansing processes and reducing the burden on the adrenal glands?",
            "options": ["Fasting for extended periods", "Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol", "Ensuring adequate hydration and supporting liver function", "Taking high doses of diuretics"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adequate hydration and supporting liver function are crucial for detoxification. The liver plays a key role in processing toxins, and proper hydration helps flush them out of the body. This reduces the burden on the adrenal glands, allowing them to function more efficiently."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A 38-year-old client, John, reports feeling constantly stressed and overwhelmed. His cortisol levels are high in the morning but crash in the afternoon. Which combination of interventions would be MOST appropriate for his personalized integrative protocol?",
            "options": ["High-intensity exercise in the evening, caffeine throughout the day, and a diet high in processed foods", "Consistent sleep-wake schedule, adaptogenic herbs like Rhodiola Rosea, stress management techniques, and a balanced diet", "Irregular sleep patterns, no stress management techniques, and a diet low in protein", "Ignoring stress signals, overworking, and relying on stimulants for energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A personalized integrative protocol should address the client's specific needs and symptoms. In John's case, a consistent sleep-wake schedule, adaptogenic herbs like Rhodiola Rosea (which can help regulate cortisol), stress management techniques, and a balanced diet are crucial for supporting adrenal health and improving his overall well-being."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Research suggests that chronic stress and adrenal dysfunction can significantly impact the immune system. Which of the following supplements is MOST directly associated with supporting immune function and reducing susceptibility to infections?",
            "options": ["Magnesium", "Vitamin D", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Vitamin B12"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating the immune system. Studies have shown that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune diseases. Supplementing with Vitamin D can help support immune function and reduce inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "In the context of adrenal fatigue and detoxification, which of the following statements BEST describes the importance of minimizing exposure to environmental toxins?",
            "options": ["Exposure to environmental toxins has no impact on adrenal function.", "Exposure to environmental toxins can exacerbate adrenal dysfunction by increasing the body's stress load.", "Exposure to environmental toxins is only relevant for individuals with pre-existing liver conditions.", "The body can easily eliminate all environmental toxins without any support."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Minimizing exposure to environmental toxins is crucial for supporting adrenal health. Toxins increase the body's overall stress load, forcing the adrenal glands to work harder. Reducing exposure allows the adrenals to recover and function more efficiently."
