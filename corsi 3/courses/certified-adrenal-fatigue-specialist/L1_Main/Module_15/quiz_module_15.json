            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "When interpreting a salivary cortisol test, what key pattern, indicative of HPA axis dysregulation, should be prioritized for initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Elevated cortisol levels throughout the day", "Consistently low cortisol levels across all time points", "A flattened diurnal curve with high evening cortisol and low morning cortisol", "Normal cortisol ranges at all time points"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A flattened diurnal curve, particularly with high evening and low morning cortisol, signifies a significant disruption in the HPA axis rhythm and requires immediate attention to restore balance."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adaptogens work by modulating the stress response, helping the body adapt to stressors and maintain physiological balance without overstimulating or suppressing any particular system. This is detailed in the integrative interventions section."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key strategy for preventing relapse in individuals recovering from adrenal fatigue, as emphasized in the 'Empowered Evolution' module?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating all stressors from their life", "Implementing a proactive stress management plan and maintaining self-awareness", "Relying solely on supplements for ongoing support", "Ignoring early warning signs of stress and fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A proactive stress management plan, including mindfulness practices, regular exercise, and healthy boundaries, is crucial for preventing relapse and maintaining long-term adrenal health. Self-awareness helps identify and address stressors early on."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "In the advanced case study analysis, a client presented with both adrenal fatigue symptoms and hypothyroidism. Which initial lab test would be MOST important to order to differentiate and manage these conditions?",
            "options": ["Salivary cortisol test", "Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Thyroid Panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3)", "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive thyroid panel is essential to assess thyroid function and rule out or confirm hypothyroidism, as it can significantly impact adrenal function and overall health."

            "options": ["Prescribing a high-dose probiotic immediately", "Recommending a restrictive elimination diet without further investigation", "Conducting a comprehensive gut health assessment (e.g., stool test)", "Ignoring the IBS symptoms and focusing solely on adrenal support"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive gut health assessment is crucial to identify potential imbalances, infections, or inflammation in the gut that may be contributing to both IBS and adrenal fatigue. Addressing gut health is often essential for overall recovery."
