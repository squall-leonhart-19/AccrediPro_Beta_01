            "options": ["The patient's age", "The diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion", "The patient's BMI", "The patient's blood type"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While age and BMI are relevant, the diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion provides critical insight into adrenal function and dysfunction."
