            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial subjective assessment tool for evaluating a client suspected of experiencing adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale", "The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)", "The Adrenal Fatigue Questionnaire (AFQ)", "The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Adrenal Fatigue Questionnaire (AFQ) is specifically designed to assess symptoms commonly associated with adrenal fatigue, making it the most targeted initial subjective assessment tool."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client's salivary cortisol test reveals high cortisol levels in the evening. Which of the following is the MOST likely interpretation?",
            "options": ["Normal adrenal function", "Hypothyroidism", "Chronic stress and HPA axis dysregulation", "Addison's disease"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated evening cortisol is often indicative of chronic stress leading to HPA axis dysregulation, where the normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol is disrupted. A 2018 study by Miller et al. in Psychoneuroendocrinology showed a strong correlation between chronic stress and elevated evening cortisol levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which of the following hormonal markers is MOST directly associated with adrenal androgen production and serves as a useful indicator of adrenal function?",
            "options": ["Estradiol", "Testosterone", "DHEA-S", "Progesterone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHEA-S (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) is primarily produced by the adrenal glands and serves as a key indicator of adrenal androgen production, offering insights into adrenal function. Low DHEA-S levels can indicate adrenal insufficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which nutrient deficiency is MOST commonly associated with impaired cortisol production and increased fatigue?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Vitamin C", "Vitamin B12", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is essential for adrenal gland function and cortisol synthesis. Deficiencies can impair cortisol production, leading to fatigue and reduced stress resilience. A 2020 review in Nutrients highlighted the role of Vitamin C in supporting adrenal health."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, reports persistent fatigue, brain fog, and sleep disturbances. Her salivary cortisol test shows low cortisol levels throughout the day. Her DHEA-S is also low. Which of the following stressors is LEAST likely to be contributing to her symptoms?",
            "options": ["Chronic sleep deprivation", "Intense aerobic exercise", "Regular meditation and mindfulness practices", "Unresolved emotional trauma"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular meditation and mindfulness practices are generally stress-reducing and supportive of adrenal function. Chronic sleep deprivation, intense exercise, and unresolved emotional trauma are more likely to exacerbate adrenal fatigue symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which of the following conditions should be ruled out FIRST when assessing a client presenting with symptoms consistent with adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Fibromyalgia", "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)", "Hypothyroidism", "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypothyroidism often presents with similar symptoms to adrenal fatigue, such as fatigue, weight gain, and cognitive impairment. Ruling out hypothyroidism is crucial before attributing symptoms solely to adrenal fatigue. According to the National Academy of Hypothyroidism, about 60% of people with thyroid disease are unaware of their condition."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client's assessment data reveals low morning cortisol, normal afternoon cortisol, and elevated evening cortisol. DHEA-S is low. Based on this information, which of the following initial recommendations is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Implementing a strict ketogenic diet", "Prioritizing sleep hygiene and stress reduction techniques", "Administering high-dose vitamin D supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing sleep hygiene and stress reduction techniques is the most appropriate initial recommendation, as the cortisol pattern suggests HPA axis dysregulation due to chronic stress. Addressing sleep and stress is fundamental before implementing more aggressive interventions. A 2022 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism confirms the effectiveness of sleep hygiene in regulating cortisol levels."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the relationship between the HPA axis and adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Adrenal fatigue is a complete shutdown of the adrenal glands, leading to Addison's disease.", "Adrenal fatigue is primarily caused by a deficiency in cortisol production.", "Adrenal fatigue is a disruption of the HPA axis, leading to altered cortisol patterns.", "Adrenal fatigue is a genetic condition that cannot be reversed."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adrenal fatigue is best understood as a disruption of the HPA axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis), which leads to altered cortisol patterns and an impaired stress response. It's not a complete shutdown but rather a dysregulation. A 2019 study in Stress showed that chronic stress can alter the HPA axis feedback loop, leading to fatigue and other symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of adrenal fatigue and reports a history of chronic dieting and restrictive eating. Which nutrient imbalance is MOST likely contributing to their condition?",
            "options": ["Excessive sodium intake", "Iron overload", "Essential fatty acid deficiency", "Vitamin A toxicity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency is common in individuals with a history of chronic dieting and restrictive eating. EFAs are crucial for hormone production and overall adrenal function. A 2021 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition linked EFA deficiency to impaired adrenal response to stress."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client's assessment reveals low cortisol and DHEA-S levels, alongside elevated Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antibodies. Which contributing stressor is MOST likely impacting their adrenal function?",
            "options": ["Financial strain", "Chronic infection", "Sedentary lifestyle", "Seasonal allergies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated EBV antibodies suggest a chronic or reactivated viral infection. Chronic infections place a significant burden on the immune system and the adrenal glands, contributing to adrenal fatigue. Research published in the Journal of Neuroinflammation has shown that chronic infections can dysregulate the HPA axis."
