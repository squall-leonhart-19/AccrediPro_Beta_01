            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the THRIVE framework's primary purpose in adrenal support?",
            "options": ["A rigid protocol for adrenal fatigue recovery.", "A flexible, individualized approach that addresses multiple facets of well-being.", "A method focused solely on pharmaceutical interventions.", "A short-term solution for managing acute stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE framework emphasizes a holistic, personalized approach, considering various lifestyle factors beyond just symptom management. It's not a rigid protocol or solely focused on medication."

        {
            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A client's lab results show elevated evening cortisol levels and low DHEA-S. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial interpretation?",
            "options": ["The client is likely experiencing severe adrenal insufficiency and requires immediate medical intervention.", "The client's adrenal glands are functioning optimally.", "The client is likely experiencing chronic stress and HPA axis dysregulation.", "The client likely has a thyroid disorder unrelated to adrenal function."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated evening cortisol and low DHEA-S are indicative of HPA axis dysregulation, often associated with chronic stress. It doesn't necessarily indicate severe adrenal insufficiency requiring immediate intervention."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on personalized nutrition strategies, what is the PRIMARY reason for tailoring dietary interventions for adrenal support?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personalized nutrition aims to address individual needs, considering factors like nutrient deficiencies, food sensitivities, and metabolic differences. It's not about following trends or restrictive diets."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "Which restorative practice is MOST directly associated with regulating the circadian rhythm?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness meditation.", "Regular exercise.", "Consistent sleep-wake schedule and light exposure.", "Social interaction."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A consistent sleep-wake schedule, coupled with appropriate light exposure (especially morning sunlight), is crucial for entraining the circadian rhythm and improving sleep quality."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing anxiety and difficulty concentrating. Which adaptogen is MOST likely to be considered FIRST, based on its calming and cognitive-enhancing properties?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea.", "Ashwagandha.", "Eleuthero.", "Ginseng."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is often favored for its calming and anxiolytic effects, and it has also shown promise in improving cognitive function. Rhodiola is more stimulating, while Eleuthero and Ginseng are generally used for energy and stamina."

            "options": ["It eliminates all sources of stress from one's life.", "It creates a sense of purpose and reduces stress associated with internal conflict.", "It guarantees financial success.", "It makes one more popular and well-liked."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important aspect of empowered self-care for long-term adrenal health?",
            "options": ["Indulging in occasional luxuries.", "Prioritizing activities that genuinely replenish energy and foster resilience.", "Avoiding all stressful situations.", "Following a strict routine without flexibility."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "In a case study, a 45-year-old woman presented with fatigue, insomnia, and anxiety. Her lab results showed low salivary cortisol throughout the day. Which of the following initial interventions would be MOST appropriate, considering the THRIVE framework?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high dose of cortisol medication.", "Implementing a consistent sleep schedule, stress reduction techniques, and gentle exercise.", "Recommending a ketogenic diet.", "Suggesting complete bed rest."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the low cortisol levels and symptoms, a holistic approach focusing on sleep hygiene, stress management, and gentle activity is the most appropriate initial intervention. Cortisol medication should be considered cautiously and under medical supervision."

            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of 15 studies (n=1234) showed that participants who practiced mindfulness meditation for at least 20 minutes daily experienced a statistically significant reduction in perceived stress levels (p < 0.05). How does this statistic relate to adrenal health?",
            "options": ["It suggests that mindfulness meditation is ineffective for managing stress.", "It supports the use of mindfulness meditation as a tool for reducing stress, which can positively impact adrenal function.", "It indicates that only individuals with diagnosed anxiety disorders benefit from mindfulness meditation.", "It proves that mindfulness meditation completely cures adrenal fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis provides evidence that mindfulness meditation can reduce perceived stress, which in turn can positively influence adrenal function by mitigating the impact of chronic stress on the HPA axis."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE framework emphasizes ongoing assessment and adaptation. Re-evaluating the client's needs and adjusting the intervention plan is crucial for addressing persistent symptoms and optimizing outcomes. It is important to continue non-invasive techniques before moving to medication."
