            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her lab results show elevated TPO antibodies. Which condition is MOST likely contributing to her adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Rheumatoid Arthritis", "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis", "Type 2 Diabetes", "Osteoarthritis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid, is frequently associated with adrenal dysfunction. Elevated TPO antibodies are indicative of this condition, making it the most likely contributor in this scenario. Untreated hypothyroidism can exacerbate adrenal fatigue symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing both depressive episodes and periods of heightened energy and impulsivity. They also complain of chronic fatigue. Which mood disorder should be considered in relation to their adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Generalized Anxiety Disorder", "Major Depressive Disorder", "Bipolar Disorder", "Seasonal Affective Disorder"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating periods of depression and mania. The cyclical nature of this disorder can place significant stress on the adrenal glands, contributing to adrenal fatigue. It's crucial to differentiate bipolar disorder from other mood disorders for appropriate management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of individuals with Fibromyalgia also experience adrenal insufficiency?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 70% of individuals diagnosed with Fibromyalgia also exhibit signs of adrenal insufficiency. This highlights the strong correlation between chronic pain conditions like Fibromyalgia and adrenal gland dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client presents with bloating, gas, and abdominal pain, along with fatigue and brain fog. They have a history of antibiotic use. Which gut condition is MOST likely contributing to their adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Ulcerative Colitis", "Crohn's Disease", "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)", "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SIBO is characterized by an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, often following antibiotic use. This overgrowth can lead to inflammation and nutrient malabsorption, contributing to adrenal fatigue. The client's symptoms of bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and brain fog are highly suggestive of SIBO."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A 52-year-old woman reports hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings, along with persistent fatigue. Which hormonal transition is MOST likely impacting her adrenal function?",
            "options": ["Puberty", "Pregnancy", "Menopause", "Andropause"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Menopause is characterized by a decline in estrogen and progesterone levels, which can significantly impact adrenal function. The hormonal fluctuations during menopause can exacerbate adrenal fatigue symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and fatigue. The average age for menopause is around 51."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client suspects mold exposure in their home is contributing to their fatigue and cognitive issues. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step in addressing this concern?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting a detox protocol", "Ordering a blood test for heavy metals", "Recommending a professional mold inspection of their home", "Suggesting they increase their intake of cruciferous vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A professional mold inspection is crucial to identify and quantify mold levels in the client's home. This provides objective data to confirm mold exposure and guide remediation efforts. Starting a detox protocol or ordering blood tests without confirming mold exposure is premature."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client's genetic testing reveals a homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation. What is the MOST important nutritional consideration for this client in relation to their adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Increasing iron intake", "Supplementing with methylated folate", "Avoiding all B vitamins", "Limiting protein consumption"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation can impair the body's ability to convert folate into its active form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). Supplementing with methylated folate can bypass this impaired conversion and support methylation pathways, which are crucial for adrenal function and detoxification."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client with suspected adrenal fatigue is also taking medication for a pre-existing heart condition. What is the MOST ethically responsible course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending adrenal support supplements", "Advising the client to discontinue their heart medication", "Collaborating with the client's cardiologist to ensure safety and avoid interactions", "Providing general wellness advice without addressing adrenal fatigue specifically"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Collaborating with the client's cardiologist is essential to ensure that any adrenal support strategies do not interact negatively with their heart medication or pre-existing condition. This collaborative approach prioritizes the client's safety and well-being and is within the ethical scope of practice."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing chronic fatigue, muscle pain, and digestive issues. They have been diagnosed with both Fibromyalgia and SIBO. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial approach to address their adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on adrenal support supplements", "Addressing both the gut dysbiosis and chronic pain simultaneously", "Prioritizing SIBO treatment to reduce inflammation and improve nutrient absorption", "Prioritizing pain management to improve sleep and reduce stress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing SIBO treatment is often beneficial as reducing gut inflammation and improving nutrient absorption can have a cascading effect on overall health, including adrenal function and pain levels. Addressing the root cause of inflammation can provide a more sustainable and holistic approach to managing their complex condition."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client has a history of long-term stress and exhibits symptoms of adrenal fatigue. Their saliva cortisol test shows elevated cortisol levels in the evening. Which lifestyle intervention is MOST appropriate to recommend?",
            "options": ["Intense exercise in the evening", "Complete rest and avoiding all activity", "Implementing stress-reduction techniques like meditation and yoga in the evening", "Consuming sugary snacks before bedtime"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated evening cortisol levels indicate dysregulation of the HPA axis. Implementing stress-reduction techniques like meditation and yoga in the evening can help lower cortisol levels and promote relaxation, improving sleep quality and supporting adrenal recovery. Intense exercise or sugary snacks before bedtime can further disrupt cortisol levels."
