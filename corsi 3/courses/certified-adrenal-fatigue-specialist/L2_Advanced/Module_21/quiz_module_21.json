            "question": "When synthesizing assessment data to create a personalized adrenal fatigue treatment plan, which of the following is the MOST critical initial step?",
            "options": ["Recommending a standardized supplement protocol.", "Identifying the client's primary stressors and their impact on the HPA axis.", "Immediately implementing a strict elimination diet.", "Prescribing adaptogenic herbs based on initial symptom presentation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying the client's primary stressors and their impact on the HPA axis is paramount. This foundational understanding guides all subsequent interventions, ensuring they are targeted and effective in addressing the root causes of adrenal dysregulation."

            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, reports chronic fatigue, brain fog, and sleep disturbances. Her salivary cortisol test reveals elevated cortisol levels in the evening. Based on this information, which nutritional strategy would be MOST appropriate to prioritize?",
            "options": ["Encouraging large, carbohydrate-rich meals in the evening to promote relaxation.", "Recommending a protein-rich snack before bed to stabilize blood sugar and support cortisol regulation.", "Suggesting complete avoidance of carbohydrates after 6 PM.", "Implementing intermittent fasting with a 16-hour fasting window."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A protein-rich snack before bed can help stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent cortisol spikes during the night, promoting better sleep and reducing overall stress on the adrenal glands. This is particularly important given Sarah's elevated evening cortisol."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradually reintroducing complex carbohydrates can help support cortisol production and balance hormone levels. While ketogenic diets can be beneficial for some, they can also exacerbate adrenal fatigue in certain individuals, particularly those with low cortisol and elevated DHEA-S.
