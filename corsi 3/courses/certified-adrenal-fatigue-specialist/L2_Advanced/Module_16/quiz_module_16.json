            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the case study of the athlete with adrenal exhaustion, which of the following was NOT a primary consideration in their recovery plan?",
            "options": ["Optimizing sleep hygiene", "Implementing a strict ketogenic diet", "Managing inflammation through targeted nutrition", "Gradual exercise re-introduction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While nutrition and exercise are important, a strict ketogenic diet was not explicitly mentioned as a primary focus in the athlete's recovery plan. The focus was more on balanced nutrition and managing inflammation."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "For the pediatric case involving a child with ADHD and adrenal dysfunction, which intervention is MOST likely to be beneficial as a first step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a stimulant medication", "Implementing dietary changes and stress reduction techniques", "Initiating high-dose adrenal glandular supplements", "Recommending intensive behavioral therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dietary changes and stress reduction techniques are generally considered a foundational and less invasive first step in supporting adrenal function in children with ADHD, before considering more aggressive interventions."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "When managing adrenal fatigue in pregnancy, what is the MOST critical consideration regarding supplementation?",
            "options": ["Aggressively supplementing with DHEA to improve energy levels", "Avoiding all supplementation due to potential risks to the fetus", "Ensuring the safety of all supplements for both mother and baby, consulting with an OB/GYN", "Recommending high doses of adaptogens to manage stress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The safety of both the mother and the developing fetus is paramount. All supplement recommendations should be made in consultation with an OB/GYN or qualified healthcare professional."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "In cases of adrenal insufficiency linked to trauma history, which therapeutic approach is MOST likely to provide long-term benefit?",
            "options": ["Solely focusing on adrenal support through supplementation", "Addressing the underlying trauma through therapy alongside adrenal support", "Ignoring the trauma history and only focusing on the physical symptoms", "Prescribing long-term corticosteroid replacement therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying trauma is crucial for long-term healing. Adrenal support alone may provide temporary relief, but it will not resolve the root cause of the dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on chronic pain management and adrenal fatigue, what percentage of chronic pain patients also experience symptoms of adrenal dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 70% of chronic pain patients experience symptoms indicative of adrenal dysfunction, highlighting the importance of addressing adrenal health in this population."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "During menopause, which hormone imbalance is MOST likely to exacerbate adrenal fatigue symptoms?",
            "options": ["Elevated estrogen levels", "Decreased progesterone levels", "Increased testosterone levels", "Stable hormone levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Decreased progesterone levels during menopause can contribute to increased stress and anxiety, further burdening the adrenal glands and worsening adrenal fatigue symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "What is the MOST important strategy for relapse prevention in long-term adrenal support?",
            "options": ["Continuing high-dose supplementation indefinitely", "Implementing sustainable lifestyle changes and stress management techniques", "Completely discontinuing all adrenal support", "Relying solely on medication for symptom management"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainable lifestyle changes, including stress management, diet, and exercise, are crucial for maintaining adrenal health and preventing relapse. Supplementation should be part of a broader strategy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the autoimmune case study, what role did gut health play in adrenal dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Gut health was irrelevant to the adrenal dysfunction.", "Gut inflammation exacerbated systemic inflammation, further stressing the adrenals.", "Improved gut health had no impact on the autoimmune condition.", "The patient had no gut issues."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut inflammation in autoimmune conditions can trigger a cascade of systemic inflammation, placing additional stress on the adrenal glands and impairing their function."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A 35-year-old female presents with fatigue, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. She reports a history of childhood trauma. According to the lesson on adrenal insufficiency and trauma, which of the following lab tests would be MOST helpful in assessing her adrenal function?",
            "options": ["A single morning cortisol level", "A 24-hour urine cortisol test", "An ACTH stimulation test", "A comprehensive salivary cortisol test measuring cortisol levels throughout the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive salivary cortisol test provides a more complete picture of the cortisol diurnal rhythm, which can be disrupted by chronic stress and trauma."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Due to limited research on the safety of adaptogens during pregnancy, it is generally recommended to avoid them unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a qualified healthcare professional. The potential risks outweigh the benefits in most cases."
