            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a validated questionnaire commonly used for subjective assessment of adrenal fatigue symptoms?",
            "options": ["Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7)", "Adrenal Fatigue Questionnaire (AFQ)", "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)", "Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Adrenal Fatigue Questionnaire (AFQ) is specifically designed to assess symptoms associated with adrenal fatigue. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 are used for anxiety and depression, respectively, and the PSQI assesses sleep quality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client's salivary cortisol test reveals the following: Morning: High, Noon: Normal, Evening: Low, Night: Very Low. According to the lessons, what pattern does this suggest?",
            "options": ["Normal diurnal cortisol rhythm", "Flattened diurnal cortisol rhythm", "Inverted diurnal cortisol rhythm", "Early-stage HPA axis dysregulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "High morning cortisol followed by a decline throughout the day, ending with very low nighttime levels, often indicates early-stage HPA axis dysregulation where the body is struggling to maintain cortisol levels throughout the day."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which hormone, beyond cortisol, is MOST relevant to assess when investigating potential adrenal imbalances and their impact on other systems?",
            "options": ["Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)", "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)", "Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S)", "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DHEA-S is a crucial hormone produced by the adrenal glands and serves as a precursor to other hormones. Its levels often correlate with adrenal function and overall hormonal balance. Assessing TSH is important, but not directly related to adrenal hormone production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to the lessons, which inflammatory marker is MOST indicative of chronic, systemic inflammation and its potential impact on adrenal function?",
            "options": ["Interleukin-6 (IL-6)", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)", "C-reactive protein (CRP)", "Interleukin-10 (IL-10)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a widely recognized and easily measurable marker of systemic inflammation. Elevated CRP levels suggest a higher degree of chronic inflammation, which can negatively impact adrenal function. While IL-6 and TNF-α are inflammatory cytokines, CRP provides a broader overview."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A client reports persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, and frequent infections. Blood tests reveal low levels of Vitamin D and Magnesium. How might these nutrient deficiencies contribute to adrenal dysfunction?",
            "options": ["They directly inhibit cortisol production.", "They impair the liver's ability to metabolize cortisol.", "They exacerbate the stress response and impair HPA axis regulation.", "They enhance the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D and Magnesium are crucial for various physiological processes, including immune function and stress response. Deficiencies in these nutrients can amplify the stress response, leading to HPA axis dysregulation and contributing to adrenal dysfunction."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In the THRIVE Framework™, what does the 'V' represent, and how does it relate to the assessment process?",
            "options": ["Vitality: Assessing the client's overall energy levels.", "Values: Identifying the client's core values to align treatment goals.", "Verify: Validating assessment findings with the client's subjective experience.", "Vision: Exploring the client's future goals to motivate adherence."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the THRIVE Framework™, 'V' stands for Verify. This emphasizes the importance of confirming assessment findings with the client's subjective experience to ensure a holistic and client-centered approach."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms mimicking adrenal fatigue, but also reports unexplained weight loss, increased thirst, and frequent urination. Which condition should be ruled out FIRST?",
            "options": ["Hypothyroidism", "Type 2 Diabetes", "Addison's Disease", "Cushing's Syndrome"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Addison's Disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) is a critical differential diagnosis to rule out due to its potentially life-threatening nature. Symptoms like weight loss, increased thirst, and frequent urination, alongside fatigue, warrant immediate investigation for adrenal insufficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "When interpreting salivary cortisol results, what is the significance of the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)?",
            "options": ["It reflects the overall cortisol production capacity of the adrenal glands.", "It indicates the body's ability to respond to acute stress.", "It shows the body's ability to suppress cortisol production at night.", "It represents the magnitude of cortisol increase in the 30-60 minutes after waking and reflects HPA axis reactivity."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is the increase in cortisol levels that occurs within the first hour of waking. It is a sensitive marker of HPA axis activity and the body's ability to respond to the anticipation of the day's stressors."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with fatigue, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Her salivary cortisol test shows a flattened diurnal curve. Her DHEA-S levels are also low. Based on this data, which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescription cortisol replacement therapy", "High-dose vitamin C supplementation", "Adaptogenic herbs and stress management techniques", "Strict elimination diet to address potential food sensitivities"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Given the flattened cortisol curve and low DHEA-S, supporting the adrenal glands with adaptogenic herbs and implementing stress management techniques is a reasonable first step. This approach aims to modulate the HPA axis gently. Prescription cortisol replacement is generally reserved for cases of confirmed adrenal insufficiency after other interventions have been tried."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the relationship between gut health and adrenal function?",
            "options": ["Gut dysbiosis has no significant impact on adrenal function.", "A healthy gut microbiome directly stimulates cortisol production.", "Gut inflammation can trigger HPA axis activation and contribute to adrenal dysfunction.", "The gut microbiome primarily influences thyroid hormone conversion, not adrenal function."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gut inflammation, often stemming from dysbiosis or leaky gut, can activate the HPA axis, leading to increased cortisol production and potentially contributing to adrenal dysfunction. The gut-brain axis plays a significant role in regulating the stress response."
