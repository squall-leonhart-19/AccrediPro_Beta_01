            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary approaches is generally MOST appropriate for supporting adrenal function?",
            "options": ["A high-protein, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet", "A balanced diet with consistent meal timing, emphasizing whole foods, and limiting processed foods and stimulants", "A very low-calorie diet for rapid weight loss", "A diet consisting primarily of raw fruits and vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A balanced diet with consistent meal timing, emphasizing whole foods, and limiting processed foods and stimulants provides stable energy and supports hormonal balance."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "Which stress management technique has been shown in research to significantly reduce cortisol levels and improve sleep quality in individuals with adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Mindfulness meditation and deep breathing exercises", "Competitive sports and activities", "Prolonged exposure to stressful situations for desensitization"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation and deep breathing exercises activate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and reducing cortisol levels. Studies have shown significant improvements in sleep quality with consistent practice."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on strategic supplementation, which adaptogen is commonly used to support the body's stress response and improve energy levels, but should be used with caution in individuals with autoimmune conditions?",
            "options": ["Magnesium", "Vitamin C", "Ashwagandha", "Rhodiola Rosea"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is a powerful adaptogen that can help regulate cortisol levels and improve energy. However, it may stimulate the immune system, potentially exacerbating autoimmune conditions. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine highlighted this consideration."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "What type of exercise is generally recommended for individuals in the early stages of adrenal fatigue recovery?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Long-distance running", "Gentle activities like walking, yoga, and swimming", "Weightlifting with heavy loads"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle activities like walking, yoga, and swimming minimize stress on the body and promote recovery. High-intensity exercise can exacerbate adrenal fatigue in the early stages."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (35), reports experiencing chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mild anxiety. She has been following a restrictive diet for weight loss. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step in her adrenal fatigue program?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high dose of adaptogenic herbs", "Recommending an immediate increase in high-intensity exercise", "Assessing her dietary habits and implementing a balanced, nutrient-dense meal plan", "Suggesting complete bed rest for two weeks"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing dietary deficiencies and imbalances is crucial for supporting adrenal function. A balanced, nutrient-dense meal plan provides the building blocks for hormone production and energy."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key strategy for long-term maintenance and prevention of adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to a rigid diet and exercise plan indefinitely", "Regularly monitoring stress levels and implementing proactive stress management techniques", "Completely eliminating all sources of stress from one's life", "Relying solely on supplements for adrenal support"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regularly monitoring stress levels and implementing proactive stress management techniques allows for early intervention and prevents relapse. According to a 2021 study in 'Stress', consistent stress monitoring is correlated with better long-term outcomes in adrenal fatigue management."

            "options": ["Immediately increasing his dosage of adaptogenic herbs", "Re-evaluating his sleep hygiene practices and considering sleep-promoting supplements or referral to a sleep specialist", "Recommending a prolonged period of sleep deprivation to reset his circadian rhythm", "Suggesting he discontinue all stress management techniques as they are clearly ineffective"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Re-evaluating sleep hygiene practices and considering sleep-promoting supplements (e.g., magnesium, melatonin) or referral to a sleep specialist addresses potential underlying sleep disorders or imbalances. A comprehensive approach is often necessary for optimal sleep optimization."
