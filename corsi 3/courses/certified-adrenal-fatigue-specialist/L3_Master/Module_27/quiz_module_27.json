        {
            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "Which autoimmune disorder is most commonly associated with adrenal dysfunction, based on research discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["Rheumatoid Arthritis", "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus", "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis", "Multiple Sclerosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid, is frequently linked with adrenal dysfunction due to shared inflammatory pathways and immune system dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "An endurance athlete presents with persistent fatigue, despite adequate rest and nutrition. Which of the following salivary cortisol patterns would be MOST indicative of adrenal fatigue in this individual?",
            "options": ["Elevated cortisol throughout the day", "Normal cortisol levels at all times", "Low cortisol levels throughout the day", "High morning cortisol, followed by a steep decline throughout the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In athletes experiencing adrenal fatigue, a common pattern is an initially high cortisol level in the morning (due to the stress response) followed by a rapid decline, failing to sustain energy levels throughout the day. This differs from consistently low cortisol, which is seen in later stages of adrenal exhaustion."

        {
            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A client with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and suspected adrenal fatigue reports increased bloating and gas after meals. Which dietary modification is MOST likely to provide initial relief, considering the link between adrenal function and digestion?",
            "options": ["Increasing fiber intake significantly", "Adopting a strict ketogenic diet", "Implementing a low-FODMAP diet", "Eliminating all carbohydrates"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet reduces fermentable carbohydrates that can exacerbate digestive symptoms like bloating and gas, common in IBS. Given the link between stress and gut motility, addressing adrenal fatigue concurrently can improve digestive function."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "According to the module, what percentage of individuals with depression also exhibit HPA axis dysregulation, a key feature of adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with depression also show evidence of HPA axis dysregulation, indicating a significant overlap between adrenal fatigue and mental health disorders."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old woman experiences hot flashes, night sweats, and fatigue. She also reports feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Which herbal adaptogen is MOST likely to address both her adrenal function and menopausal symptoms?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Siberian Ginseng", "Black Cohosh"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that can support adrenal function and reduce stress, while also demonstrating potential benefits for menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and sleep disturbances by influencing hormone balance. Black Cohosh primarily addresses menopausal symptoms but has less direct impact on adrenal function."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A male client experiencing erectile dysfunction and low libido is suspected of having both adrenal fatigue and hormonal imbalance. Besides cortisol testing, which hormone level should be prioritized for assessment?",
            "options": ["Estrogen", "Prolactin", "Testosterone", "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Testosterone plays a crucial role in male sexual function and libido. Adrenal fatigue can impact testosterone production, making it a key hormone to assess in men presenting with these symptoms. While other hormones are relevant, testosterone is the most directly related to the presenting complaints."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia reports heightened sensitivity to odors and chemicals. Which intervention is MOST appropriate to address both their chronic pain and environmental sensitivities in the context of adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["High-intensity exercise", "Complete avoidance of all potential allergens", "Gentle detoxification support and stress reduction techniques", "Opioid pain medication"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle detoxification supports the body's natural elimination processes without overwhelming the system, and stress reduction techniques help regulate the HPA axis, reducing sensitivity to environmental triggers and alleviating pain. High-intensity exercise could be counterproductive due to increased stress on the adrenals."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which chronic stress, associated with adrenal fatigue, can exacerbate autoimmune diseases?",
            "options": ["Increased antibody production", "Suppression of the immune system", "Increased Th1 cytokine production", "Dysregulation of the HPA axis and increased inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and HPA axis dysregulation lead to increased inflammation throughout the body. This heightened inflammatory state can exacerbate autoimmune responses, leading to increased disease activity and symptom severity."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A high-performing executive experiencing burnout and adrenal fatigue is considering supplementing with phosphatidylserine (PS). What is the primary rationale for using PS in this context?",
            "options": ["To increase cortisol production", "To improve sleep quality", "To blunt the cortisol response to stress", "To enhance cognitive function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phosphatidylserine (PS) is believed to help regulate cortisol levels, particularly in response to stress. By blunting the cortisol response, PS can help prevent excessive cortisol release and mitigate the negative effects of chronic stress on the adrenal glands. While it can improve sleep and cognitive function, the primary rationale is cortisol regulation."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A client with both adrenal fatigue and a history of mold exposure reports persistent brain fog and fatigue. Which of the following interventions should be prioritized to address the root cause of their symptoms?",
            "options": ["Adrenal support supplements only", "Strict gluten-free diet", "Mold remediation and detoxification support", "Cognitive behavioral therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In cases of mold exposure, addressing the underlying environmental issue is paramount. Mold remediation removes the source of the toxin, and detoxification support helps the body eliminate the toxins. While adrenal support and other interventions are valuable, they are secondary to addressing the root cause of the mold exposure."
