        {
            "id": "q29_1",
            "question": "In the THRIVE framework, what is the MOST important initial step when tailoring the approach for a client with suspected adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Implementing a strict elimination diet.", "Assessing the client's current stress levels and coping mechanisms.", "Immediately starting adaptogenic herbs.", "Ordering a comprehensive adrenal hormone panel."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing the client's stress and coping mechanisms is fundamental to tailoring the THRIVE framework effectively. It informs subsequent interventions and ensures a client-centered approach."

        {
            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "A client's salivary cortisol test reveals low levels throughout the day. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial nutritional intervention?",
            "options": ["Implementing a ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation.", "Providing consistent protein intake throughout the day to support blood sugar balance.", "Recommending intermittent fasting to improve insulin sensitivity.", "Suggesting a high-carbohydrate diet to stimulate cortisol production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent protein intake helps stabilize blood sugar levels, which can support cortisol production and reduce stress on the adrenal glands, especially when cortisol levels are low throughout the day."

        {
            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Which restorative technique is MOST directly associated with improving vagal tone and promoting relaxation, thereby supporting adrenal health?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Diaphragmatic breathing exercises.", "Cold water immersion.", "Progressive muscle relaxation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing directly stimulates the vagus nerve, which promotes relaxation and reduces the 'fight or flight' response, supporting adrenal health."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "A client reports persistent insomnia despite implementing good sleep hygiene practices. Which advanced supplementation strategy might be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["High-dose Vitamin C supplementation.", "Targeted amino acid therapy, such as glycine or L-theanine, to promote relaxation.", "Iron supplementation, regardless of iron levels.", "Ginseng supplementation to increase energy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Targeted amino acids like glycine and L-theanine can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality without the stimulating effects of other supplements, making them suitable for insomnia."

        {
            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Vitality & Values Alignment' principle, what is the PRIMARY goal of aligning a client's daily activities with their core values?",
            "options": ["To increase productivity and efficiency.", "To reduce stress and enhance overall well-being.", "To achieve financial success.", "To conform to societal expectations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aligning daily activities with core values reduces stress by creating a sense of purpose and fulfillment, thereby enhancing overall well-being and supporting adrenal health."

        {
            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "In fostering resilience for long-term adrenal health, what is the MOST crucial aspect of 'Empowered Evolution'?",
            "options": ["Avoiding all stressors.", "Developing effective coping strategies and adapting to challenges.", "Strictly adhering to a rigid diet plan.", "Isolating oneself from potentially stressful relationships."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowered Evolution focuses on building resilience by equipping clients with the tools to navigate stress effectively and adapt to life's challenges, rather than avoiding stress altogether."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of adrenal fatigue, thyroid dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis. Which integrative approach is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Addressing each condition in isolation with separate protocols.", "Prioritizing gut health first to improve nutrient absorption and reduce inflammation.", "Focusing solely on adrenal support to reduce stress hormones.", "Ignoring the gut and thyroid and focusing on adrenal support only."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut health often plays a foundational role in overall health. Addressing gut dysbiosis first can improve nutrient absorption, reduce inflammation, and support both adrenal and thyroid function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "A client's DUTCH test reveals elevated levels of cortisol metabolites and low levels of DHEA-S. Which of the following supplement strategies is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Administering high doses of adaptogens to lower cortisol.", "Focusing on supporting healthy DHEA production with precursors like pregnenolone, while carefully monitoring cortisol levels.", "Ignoring the DHEA levels and focusing solely on cortisol reduction.", "Administering cortisol-suppressing medications immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supporting DHEA production while monitoring cortisol levels provides a balanced approach, addressing both the elevated cortisol metabolites and low DHEA-S, promoting hormonal balance."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 45-year-old client, reports chronic fatigue, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Her lab results show normal cortisol levels but low heart rate variability (HRV). Which intervention is MOST likely to improve her HRV and overall well-being?",
            "options": ["Intense cardio exercise.", "Mindfulness meditation and regular walks in nature.", "A strict ketogenic diet.", "High doses of caffeine."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation and nature walks can improve HRV by promoting relaxation and reducing sympathetic nervous system activity, which aligns with Sarah's symptoms of anxiety and difficulty sleeping."
