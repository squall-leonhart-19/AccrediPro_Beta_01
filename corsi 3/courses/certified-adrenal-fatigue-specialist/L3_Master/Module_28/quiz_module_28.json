            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST immediate and critical intervention for a patient experiencing an adrenal crisis?",
            "options": ["Administering oral adaptogens", "Initiating intravenous hydrocortisone", "Encouraging deep breathing exercises", "Providing a carbohydrate-rich snack"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intravenous hydrocortisone is the primary treatment to rapidly address the cortisol deficiency during an adrenal crisis, as oral medications and supportive measures alone are insufficient."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A patient with suspected adrenal insufficiency presents with fatigue, muscle weakness, and unexplained weight loss. Initial blood tests show low sodium and high potassium levels. Which of the following conditions should be MOST suspected?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "Cushing's syndrome", "Addison's disease", "Type 2 Diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low sodium (hyponatremia) and high potassium (hyperkalemia) are classic electrolyte imbalances seen in Addison's disease, a primary adrenal insufficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "According to studies discussed, what percentage of patients with PTSD also experience symptoms consistent with adrenal dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 50% of individuals with PTSD also exhibit signs of adrenal dysregulation, highlighting the strong link between psychological trauma and the HPA axis."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which of the following medications is MOST likely to interfere with cortisol production, potentially exacerbating adrenal insufficiency?",
            "options": ["Metformin", "Prednisone", "Levothyroxine", "Lisinopril"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prednisone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, can suppress the body's natural cortisol production, potentially worsening adrenal insufficiency if not managed carefully."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety. She reports a history of childhood trauma. Which of the following diagnostic tests would be MOST appropriate to initially assess her adrenal function?",
            "options": ["MRI of the adrenal glands", "24-hour urinary cortisol test", "Salivary cortisol testing at multiple time points", "ACTH stimulation test"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Salivary cortisol testing at multiple time points throughout the day provides a non-invasive way to assess the diurnal cortisol pattern, which can be disrupted in individuals with chronic stress and trauma."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "When using adaptogenic herbs in complex cases, what is the MOST important consideration for tailoring the intervention?",
            "options": ["Patient's weight", "Patient's blood type", "Patient's specific symptom profile and HPA axis dysfunction pattern", "Time of year"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most effective use of adaptogens requires matching the herb's specific properties to the individual's unique symptom presentation and pattern of HPA axis dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A patient with a history of adrenal insufficiency is scheduled for elective surgery. What is the MOST crucial step to prevent an adrenal crisis during the perioperative period?",
            "options": ["Discontinuing all adrenal support supplements", "Administering a stress dose of corticosteroids", "Withholding all fluids and electrolytes", "Delaying the surgery indefinitely"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Administering a stress dose of corticosteroids is essential to compensate for the increased cortisol demand during surgery and prevent an adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle modifications is MOST crucial for the long-term management and prevention of adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) every day", "Consistent sleep schedule and stress management techniques", "Strict ketogenic diet", "Intermittent fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A consistent sleep schedule and effective stress management techniques are fundamental for supporting the HPA axis and promoting long-term resilience."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "In the context of ethical considerations, what is the MOST important aspect when working with complex cases of adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Guaranteeing a full recovery", "Maintaining clear professional boundaries and scope of practice", "Promising immediate symptom relief", "Diagnosing every patient with adrenal fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining clear professional boundaries and scope of practice is essential to protect both the practitioner and the patient, ensuring ethical and responsible care."
