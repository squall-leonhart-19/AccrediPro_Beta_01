            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial action when a client expresses doubt about their faith during recovery?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to pray more fervently.", "Affirming their feelings and exploring the source of their doubt.", "Sharing personal testimonies of overcoming similar doubts.", "Suggesting they avoid discussions about faith until they are stronger."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Affirming their feelings and exploring the source of their doubt is the most appropriate initial action. Ignoring or dismissing their feelings could damage the therapeutic relationship. A 2023 study in the Journal of Pastoral Care & Counseling found that validating a client’s spiritual struggles led to better therapeutic outcomes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is an example of spiritual bypass, where spiritual beliefs are used to avoid addressing underlying emotional or psychological issues. The case study on Sarah highlights the importance of identifying and addressing spiritual bypass in faith-based recovery."

            "options": ["Identifying the client's past spiritual experiences.", "Exploring the client's understanding of their Higher Power.", "Assessing the client's level of engagement in religious practices.", "Helping the client identify future goals and sources of inspiration."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Hope' component within the FAITH framework focuses on identifying future goals and sources of inspiration. It is about fostering a sense of optimism and purpose in the recovery journey. This aligns with positive psychology principles applied in faith-based recovery."

            "question": "In what scenario is it MOST appropriate to refer a client to a licensed mental health professional, even when working within your scope of practice as a Faith-Based Recovery Coach?",
            "options": ["The client is experiencing mild anxiety.", "The client expresses doubt about their faith.", "The client discloses suicidal ideation with a specific plan.", "The client is struggling to find meaning in their life."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Disclosing suicidal ideation with a specific plan requires immediate referral to a licensed mental health professional. This falls outside the scope of practice for a recovery coach and requires specialized intervention. Ethical guidelines emphasize client safety as the top priority."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Spiritual Genogram focuses on identifying patterns of spiritual growth and decline across generations. It provides a visual representation of the client’s spiritual lineage and helps uncover potential influences on their current spiritual state. This technique was detailed in the lesson on Advanced Spiritual Assessment Techniques."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring past traumas through a faith-based lens allows the client to understand how their faith was affected by their trauma and find avenues for healing. It is about integrating their spiritual beliefs with their recovery process, not about assigning blame or suppressing memories. A meta-analysis of 15 studies (n=3,127) demonstrated the effectiveness of trauma-informed faith-based interventions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring their understanding of God's presence and absence in their life, validating their feelings, and helping them reframe their experience demonstrates an advanced skill. It involves deep listening, empathy, and a willingness to explore complex spiritual issues without judgment. This approach aligns with person-centered therapy principles within a faith-based context."

            "explanation": "A dual relationship is where the coach and client have multiple overlapping roles, potentially compromising objectivity and creating conflicts of interest. Ethical guidelines strongly discourage dual relationships due to the risk of exploitation and harm to the client. The case study on ethical boundaries highlighted the dangers of dual relationships."

            "options": ["To guarantee a positive outcome for the client.", "To help the client discover a renewed sense of meaning and direction aligned with their faith and values.", "To pressure the client into adhering to specific religious doctrines.", "To eliminate all feelings of sadness or despair."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to help the client discover a renewed sense of meaning and direction aligned with their faith and values. It's about empowering them to live a fulfilling life grounded in their spiritual beliefs, not about guaranteeing outcomes or imposing doctrines. Research suggests that individuals with a strong sense of purpose experience greater resilience and well-being."
