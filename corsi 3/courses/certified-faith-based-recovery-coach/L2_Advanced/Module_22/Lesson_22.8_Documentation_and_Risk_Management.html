 <h2>Ethical Considerations in Practice</h2>
 <p>Let's apply our knowledge to a complex case study, ensuring ethical decision-making at every step.</p>
 </div>

 <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
 <div class="objectives-box">
 <h3>In this lesson, you will:</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Analyze a complex case involving multiple ethical considerations.</li>
 <li>Identify potential conflicts of interest and boundary issues.</li>
 <li>Apply ethical decision-making frameworks to resolve dilemmas.</li>
 <li>Determine appropriate referral pathways based on client needs and scope of practice.</li>
 <li>Develop strategies for maintaining client confidentiality in challenging situations.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <h2>Case Study: Sarah's Story</h2>

 <div class="case-study">
 <h3>Client Profile: Sarah, 48</h3>
 <p>Sarah is a 48-year-old woman seeking faith-based recovery coaching for alcohol dependence. She is a
 devout member of your church and has been actively involved in various church activities. During your
 initial sessions, Sarah reveals that she is also struggling with marital issues and suspects her husband
 is having an affair. She asks for your advice, as a "woman of faith," on how to handle her marriage.</p>
 <p>Additionally, Sarah mentions that her husband is a prominent donor to the church and sits on the church
 board, where ethical oversight is a primary responsibility.</p>
 </div>

 <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
 <p>This case presents multiple overlapping ethical dilemmas that require careful consideration. These include:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Dual Relationships:</strong> Sarah is both a client and a member of your church community.
 Providing coaching services while also being part of the same social circle creates a dual relationship
 that can compromise objectivity and potentially lead to conflicts of interest.</li>
 <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Sarah has shared sensitive information about her marriage. Maintaining
 her confidentiality is paramount, especially given her husband's position in the church.</li>
 <li><strong>Scope of Practice:</strong> Sarah is seeking advice on her marriage, which falls outside the
 scope of a recovery coach. Providing marital counseling without proper training and credentials would be
 unethical.</li>
 <li><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> Her husband's role as a church board member and donor creates a
 potential conflict of interest, as any advice you provide could indirectly affect the church's
 financial stability and reputation.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Clinical Reasoning Process</h2>
 <ol>
 <li><strong>Identify the Ethical Dilemmas:</strong> Clearly define the ethical conflicts present in the case
 (dual relationships, confidentiality, scope of practice, conflict of interest).</li>
 <li><strong>Consult Ethical Guidelines:</strong> Review the ethical codes of conduct for faith-based recovery
 coaches, focusing on sections related to dual relationships, confidentiality, and scope of practice.</li>
 <li><strong>Seek Supervision:</strong> Consult with a qualified supervisor or mentor to discuss the case and
 receive guidance on ethical decision-making.</li>
 <li><strong>Assess Potential Risks and Benefits:</strong> Evaluate the potential risks and benefits of each
 course of action, considering the impact on Sarah, her husband, the church, and your own professional
 integrity.</li>
 <li><strong>Develop a Plan of Action:</strong> Create a detailed plan outlining how you will address the
 ethical dilemmas, ensuring that your actions are consistent with ethical principles and legal
 requirements.</li>
 </ol>

 <h2>Differential Considerations</h2>

 <table class="data-table">
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th>Priority</th>
 <th>Consideration</th>
 <th>Rationale</th>
 <th>Action</th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>Marital Advice Request</td>
 <td>Sarah is seeking guidance outside your scope of practice.</td>
 <td>Acknowledge her request, but firmly state that providing marital advice is outside your scope. Offer to help her find a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) who aligns with her faith.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>2</td>
 <td>Dual Relationship</td>
 <td>Being part of the same church community creates a dual relationship.</td>
 <td>Acknowledge the dual relationship and potential for bias. Emphasize your commitment to maintaining professional boundaries and prioritizing her well-being. Consider transferring her case to another qualified coach outside of the church, if feasible and with Sarah's consent.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>3</td>
 <td>Confidentiality Risk</td>
 <td>Her husband's position in the church could compromise confidentiality.</td>
 <td>Reinforce the importance of confidentiality and the limits to it (e.g., mandated reporting). Ensure Sarah understands that you will not disclose any information without her explicit consent, except where legally required. Document all discussions related to confidentiality.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>4</td>
 <td>Husband's Influence</td>
 <td>Her husband's role as a donor and board member could create a conflict of interest.</td>
 <td>Be mindful of any potential bias or undue influence. Focus solely on Sarah's recovery goals and avoid getting involved in church politics or personal matters related to her husband. If you feel that your objectivity is compromised, seek supervision immediately and consider transferring the case.</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>

 <h2>When to Refer</h2>

 <div class="referral-box">
 <h3>Red Flags — When to Refer Out</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Suicidal Ideation:</strong> Any indication of suicidal thoughts or plans requires immediate
 referral to a mental health professional.</li>
 <li><strong>Domestic Violence:</strong> If Sarah discloses any form of domestic violence, provide her
 with resources and encourage her to seek help from a domestic violence shelter or hotline.</li>
 <li><strong>Severe Mental Health Issues:</strong> If Sarah exhibits signs of severe depression, anxiety,
 or other mental health issues that are beyond your scope, refer her to a psychiatrist or licensed
 therapist.</li>
 <li><strong>Legal Issues:</strong> If Sarah's marital issues involve legal matters, such as divorce or
 custody disputes, advise her to seek legal counsel.</li>
 <li><strong>Medical Concerns:</strong> Any medical symptoms or concerns that arise during coaching should
 be referred to a medical doctor.</li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <h2>Phased Intervention Plan</h2>

 <div class="protocol-box">
 <h3>Ethical and Practical Approach</h3>
 <ol>

 coach, not a marriage counselor.</li>

 values.</li>
 <li>Reiterate the importance of confidentiality and its limits.</li>
 <li>Assess Sarah's understanding of the coaching process and her expectations.</li>
 <li>Document all discussions related to ethical considerations and referrals.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Phase 2: Focused Recovery Coaching (Weeks 3-8)</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>Focus on Sarah's recovery goals related to alcohol dependence.</li>
 <li>Utilize faith-based principles and practices to support her recovery journey.</li>
 <li>Provide encouragement, accountability, and relapse prevention strategies.</li>
 <li>Monitor Sarah's progress and adjust the coaching plan as needed.</li>
 <li>Continue to reinforce professional boundaries and avoid getting involved in her marital
 issues.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Phase 3: Continued Support and Referral (Weeks 9-12)</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>Continue to provide recovery coaching while Sarah engages in marriage counseling.</li>
 <li>Coordinate with the marriage counselor, with Sarah's consent, to ensure a comprehensive
 approach to her well-being.</li>
 <li>Monitor Sarah's progress and adjust the coaching plan as needed.</li>
 <li>Provide ongoing support and encouragement as she navigates her recovery and marital issues.</li>
 <li>Prepare for termination of the coaching relationship as Sarah achieves her recovery goals.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ol>
