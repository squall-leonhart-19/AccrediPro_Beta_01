            "explanation": "Miller and Delaney's meta-analysis demonstrated that incorporating spirituality into addiction treatment is linked to better adherence and lower relapse rates, even when controlling for other factors."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, expresses skepticism about the role of faith in her recovery, stating, 'I'm not religious.' How should a faith-based recovery coach respond, based on the principles of evidence-based practice?",
            "options": ["Insist that she attend religious services.", "Share personal religious beliefs and experiences.", "Explore her existing spiritual beliefs and values, focusing on areas of meaning and purpose.", "Dismiss her concerns and focus on traditional religious practices."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An evidence-based approach prioritizes respecting the client's beliefs. Exploring her existing spirituality, even if non-religious, is more effective than imposing specific religious practices."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most effective way to address this criticism is to conduct high-quality research and disseminate the findings through reputable scientific channels, strengthening the evidence base for faith-based recovery."

What type of study design would be MOST effective in establishing a causal relationship between group participation and reduced relapse?",
            "options": ["Cross-sectional survey", "Case study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Qualitative interview study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is the gold standard for establishing causality because it involves random assignment to treatment and control groups, minimizing bias."

            "question": "You are reviewing a research article on faith-based recovery. The authors conclude that their intervention is 'highly effective' based on statistically significant results, but the effect size is small (Cohen's d = 0.2). How should you interpret this finding?",
            "options": ["The intervention is highly effective and should be widely implemented.", "The intervention may have a statistically significant effect, but the practical significance is limited.", "The statistical significance is irrelevant because the study is flawed.", "The effect size is large enough to justify ignoring any limitations of the study."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A small effect size indicates that while the intervention may have a statistically significant impact, the magnitude of the effect is small and may not be clinically meaningful. Practical significance should always be considered alongside statistical significance."
