            "question": "A positive parenting coach encounters a client who discloses ongoing marital conflict that is significantly impacting the children. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Offer direct marital counseling to resolve the conflict.", "Continue coaching, focusing solely on parenting strategies and ignoring the marital issues.", "Acknowledge the impact of the marital conflict and refer the client to a qualified marriage and family therapist.", "Advise the client to separate immediately for the sake of the children."],
