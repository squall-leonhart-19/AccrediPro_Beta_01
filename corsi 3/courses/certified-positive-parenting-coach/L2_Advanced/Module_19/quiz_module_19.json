            "question": "Which of the following is a core tenet of Attachment Theory?",
            "options": ["Children are inherently manipulative.", "Secure attachment is formed through consistent and responsive caregiving.", "Punishment is the most effective method of behavior modification.", "Children should be encouraged to be independent from a very young age."],

            "explanation": "CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. Challenging and reframing negative thoughts is a core CBT technique."

            "question": "A study found that children with ADHD whose parents received parent training based on behavioral principles showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30% reduction</span> in disruptive behaviors compared to a control group. This finding illustrates the effectiveness of which approach?",
            "options": ["Attachment Parenting.", "Authoritarian Parenting.", "Evidence-based parenting interventions.", "Permissive Parenting."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This statistic demonstrates the positive impact of using research-backed methods, aligning with the principles of evidence-based parenting. Parent training programs are often highly effective for managing ADHD-related behaviors."

            "question": "When evaluating the quality of a research study, which of the following is the MOST important factor to consider?",
            "options": ["The author's personal opinions.", "The sample size and methodology used in the study.", "The publication date (more recent is always better).", "Whether the study confirms your existing beliefs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A study's validity and reliability depend on its methodology and sample size. Larger, well-designed studies provide stronger evidence than smaller, poorly designed ones. Publication date is important, but methodology is paramount."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key strategy for effectively communicating research findings to parents?",
            "options": ["Using complex jargon and technical terms.", "Presenting findings in a clear, concise, and relatable manner.", "Dismissing parents' concerns or questions about the research.", "Focusing solely on the limitations of the research."],

            "options": ["Strictly enforcing routines with minimal flexibility.", "Creating predictable routines and providing sensory supports.", "Ignoring the sensory sensitivities to encourage adaptation.", "Using punishment to discourage resistance to transitions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research on ASD highlights the importance of predictable routines and sensory supports to reduce anxiety and improve functioning. Ignoring sensory sensitivities can exacerbate distress."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25 studies</span> on the effectiveness of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) found a significant reduction in child behavioral problems with an average effect size of <span class=\"stat-highlight\">d = 0.8</span>. What does this suggest about PCIT?",
            "options": ["PCIT is likely ineffective in reducing child behavioral problems.", "PCIT has a large and positive impact on reducing child behavioral problems.", "PCIT's effectiveness is limited to specific cultural groups.", "PCIT is only effective for children with severe behavioral disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An effect size of d = 0.8 is considered a large effect, indicating that PCIT is highly effective in reducing child behavioral problems. Meta-analyses provide strong evidence due to the aggregation of multiple studies."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A respectful and evidence-based approach is crucial. Acknowledging the parent's perspective, sharing research, and offering alternatives fosters trust and encourages openness to new strategies. Directly challenging their beliefs can create resistance."
