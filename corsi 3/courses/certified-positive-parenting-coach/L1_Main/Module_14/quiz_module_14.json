            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following represents an advanced validation technique that goes beyond basic empathy, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": ["Repeating the parent's words back to them.", "Acknowledging the parent's feelings.", "Identifying the unmet needs driving the parent's behavior.", "Offering immediate solutions to the parent's problems."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying the unmet needs driving the behavior is an advanced technique, allowing for deeper understanding and validation. Repeating words or acknowledging feelings are basic empathy skills."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A parent consistently expresses doubt in their ability to implement positive parenting strategies. According to L2, what is the MOST effective initial step a coach should take to build parental self-efficacy?",
            "options": ["Providing a detailed lecture on the benefits of positive parenting.", "Identifying and celebrating small, achievable successes the parent has already experienced.", "Recommending the parent attend a week-long intensive parenting workshop.", "Suggesting the parent seek therapy for their low self-esteem."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on past successes, no matter how small, builds confidence and self-efficacy. Overwhelming them with information or suggesting therapy before addressing immediate parenting concerns can be counterproductive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to the ethical guidelines discussed in L3, which of the following scenarios presents a clear conflict of interest for a positive parenting coach?",
            "options": ["Coaching two families who are neighbors and friends.", "Receiving a referral bonus from a local bookstore for recommending parenting books.", "Providing coaching services to a family while simultaneously having a close personal relationship with them.", "Adjusting coaching fees based on the family's income."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A close personal relationship creates a conflict of interest that could compromise the coach's objectivity and the family's best interests. Coaching neighbors or receiving referral bonuses are less direct conflicts, and adjusting fees based on income can be ethical if transparent."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In L4, what is the MOST likely underlying reason for a parent's resistance to implementing positive parenting techniques, despite acknowledging their potential benefits?",
            "options": ["Lack of intelligence.", "Fear of losing control or authority.", "Inherent laziness.", "Disagreement with the coach's personality."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fear of losing control is a common driver of resistance. Parents may associate traditional authoritarian methods with maintaining order, and transitioning to positive parenting can feel threatening."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "When integrating the THRIVE Framework™ (L5) in case conceptualization, which of the following components focuses on identifying the child's strengths and resources?",
            "options": ["Thriving", "Helping", "Risk Support", "Vulnerable Tipping Point"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Thriving' component of the THRIVE Framework™ specifically addresses the child's strengths, resources, and positive experiences that contribute to their overall well-being."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "According to L6, which communication technique is MOST effective in de-escalating a tense conversation with a parent who feels overwhelmed and unheard?",
            "options": ["Offering unsolicited advice.", "Using 'I' statements to express your own feelings.", "Employing active listening skills, such as paraphrasing and summarizing.", "Interrupting the parent to correct inaccuracies."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active listening demonstrates empathy and understanding, helping the parent feel heard and validated. 'I' statements can be helpful later, but active listening is crucial for initial de-escalation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "According to the principles outlined in L7, what is the MOST effective strategy for attracting ideal clients to a positive parenting coaching practice?",
            "options": ["Offering the lowest coaching fees in the area.", "Creating a strong online presence with valuable, relevant content.", "Promising guaranteed results in a short timeframe.", "Targeting all parents, regardless of their specific needs or values."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong online presence with valuable content attracts clients who resonate with your approach and values. Promising guaranteed results is unethical, and targeting everyone dilutes your message."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in L8 indicated a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">35%</span> increase in the use of which technology-based tool in positive parenting interventions?",
            "options": ["Virtual Reality simulations", "AI-powered emotion recognition apps", "Online parenting forums", "Printable chore charts"],

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Case Study (L5): Sarah, a 6-year-old, frequently has tantrums when asked to do chores. Applying the THRIVE Framework™, which 'Helping' activity would be MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Punishing Sarah for tantrums.", "Ignoring Sarah's behavior completely.", "Teaching Sarah emotional regulation skills through age-appropriate activities.", "Rewarding Sarah with candy after completing chores."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'Helping' in the THRIVE framework focuses on targeted interventions. Teaching emotional regulation addresses the underlying cause of the tantrums, unlike punishment or ignoring the behavior."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Based on discussions in L1, L2 and L4, what is the MOST effective long-term strategy for addressing parental resistance rooted in a fear of losing control, while simultaneously fostering self-efficacy?",
            "options": ["Emphasizing strict adherence to a rigid positive parenting plan.", "Collaboratively developing flexible strategies that allow the parent to maintain a sense of authority while incorporating positive techniques.", "Ignoring the parent's concerns about control and focusing solely on the child's needs.", "Suggesting the parent relinquish all authority and adopt a completely permissive parenting style."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaboration allows the parent to feel heard and empowered, while flexibility acknowledges their need for control. A rigid plan or complete relinquishment of authority is unlikely to be successful."
