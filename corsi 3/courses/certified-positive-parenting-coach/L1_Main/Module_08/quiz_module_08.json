            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what is the estimated percentage of parents who report feeling overwhelmed by parenting at least once a week?",
            "options": ["25%", "40%", "60%", "80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 60% of parents experience feeling overwhelmed by parenting duties on a weekly basis. This highlights the importance of positive parenting strategies for managing stress."

            "options": ["Mutual Respect", "Authoritarian Discipline", "Empathy and Understanding", "Long-Term Perspective"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Authoritarian discipline, characterized by strict rules and punishment without explanation, is contrary to the core principles of positive parenting which emphasize collaboration and understanding."

            "options": ["Happiness", "Harmony", "Honesty", "Helpfulness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. Framework™, 'H' stands for Harmony, which involves identifying and addressing conflicting beliefs within the family to create a more unified and supportive environment."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A parent consistently interrupts their child while the child is explaining their feelings. According to the module, which aspect of active listening is the parent failing to demonstrate?",
            "options": ["Reflection", "Clarification", "Non-Verbal Attentiveness", "Judgment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interrupting a child demonstrates a lack of non-verbal attentiveness, as it shows the parent is not fully engaged or focused on what the child is saying. Active listening requires providing undivided attention."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which cognitive bias often leads parents to misinterpret their child's behavior as intentionally malicious when it is actually due to developmental limitations or unmet needs?",
            "options": ["Confirmation Bias", "Fundamental Attribution Error", "Availability Heuristic", "Anchoring Bias"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Fundamental Attribution Error is the tendency to overemphasize dispositional factors (like the child being 'bad') and underestimate situational factors (like fatigue or hunger) when explaining behavior."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A parent is struggling with their child's persistent refusal to do chores. Which reframing technique would be MOST helpful in shifting their perspective?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior entirely", "Focusing solely on the negative consequences", "Identifying the underlying need the behavior might be expressing", "Increasing the severity of punishments"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying the underlying need (e.g., a need for autonomy or connection) allows the parent to address the root cause of the behavior rather than simply reacting to the surface-level refusal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of empowering parents within the context of positive parenting?",
            "options": ["To make parents completely independent and self-sufficient", "To provide parents with all the answers to their parenting challenges", "To build parental confidence and skills to navigate parenting independently", "To eliminate all stress and challenges from parenting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering parents focuses on building their confidence, knowledge, and skills so they can effectively address parenting challenges on their own, not on providing all the answers or eliminating all difficulties."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on quality time, even in small increments, directly addresses the 'Tune-In' and 'Harmonize' aspects of the T.H.R.I.V.E. Framework™ by fostering connection and addressing conflicting beliefs about her ability to be a good parent."
