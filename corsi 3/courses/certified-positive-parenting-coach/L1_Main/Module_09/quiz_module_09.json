            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "When initially 'Tuning-In' according to the THRIVE model, what is the primary goal?",
            "options": ["Immediately offering solutions to the parent's challenges.", "Establishing a deep understanding of the parent's perspective and emotional state.", "Quickly assessing the child's behavior and identifying potential interventions.", "Focusing on the long-term outcomes of the coaching process."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tuning-In is about empathy and understanding. It sets the stage for effective communication and collaboration, rather than jumping to solutions prematurely."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During the 'Harmonize' phase, a parent expresses a belief that 'children should always obey adults without question.' As a coach, what is the MOST effective initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately challenge the belief and explain the importance of autonomy.", "Acknowledge the belief and explore its origins and potential impact on the parent-child relationship.", "Suggest alternative parenting strategies that promote obedience without questioning.", "Refer the parent to a child psychologist for further evaluation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Harmonize phase emphasizes understanding and acknowledging the parent's beliefs before introducing alternative perspectives. This approach fosters trust and openness to change. Starting with immediate challenge can create resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "A parent describes their child's refusal to do chores as 'lazy and disrespectful.' Which reframing technique would be MOST appropriate in this situation?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the parent's perspective and focusing solely on the child's behavior.", "Reframing the behavior as a lack of skills or understanding of expectations.", "Agreeing with the parent's assessment to validate their feelings.", "Suggesting a punishment to address the perceived laziness and disrespect."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing aims to shift perspectives. In this case, reframing 'lazy and disrespectful' as a skill deficit or unclear expectations can lead to more constructive solutions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "When 'Implementing' positive parenting strategies, what is a crucial factor to consider for long-term success?",
            "options": ["Implementing strategies that are universally effective for all children.", "Tailoring strategies to the specific needs and context of the individual family.", "Focusing solely on strategies that provide immediate results.", "Avoiding any strategies that require significant effort from the parent."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective implementation requires individualization. What works for one family may not work for another. Tailoring strategies ensures relevance and sustainability."

        {
            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "A parent shares, 'I feel like I'm constantly failing as a parent.' Which validation statement would be MOST effective?",
            "options": ["'You're not failing; you're just being too hard on yourself.'", "'I understand that you feel that way. Parenting is incredibly challenging, and it's normal to have moments of doubt.'", "'Many parents feel the same way, so you're not alone.'", "'You need to focus on your successes, not your failures.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective validation acknowledges the parent's feelings without dismissing them. It creates a safe space for the parent to explore their emotions and build resilience."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of the 'Empower' phase in the THRIVE model?",
            "options": ["To provide parents with all the answers and solutions they need.", "To foster independent problem-solving skills in parents so they can navigate future challenges.", "To ensure parents always follow the coach's recommendations.", "To create dependency on the coach for ongoing support."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment is about building self-efficacy. The goal is to equip parents with the skills and confidence to handle parenting challenges independently."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "A parent becomes defensive and resistant when you suggest a new strategy. What is the BEST approach to manage this resistance?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop suggesting new strategies and focus on what the parent is already doing.", "Acknowledge the parent's resistance, explore their concerns, and collaboratively adjust the strategy.", "Insist that the parent try the new strategy for at least a week before making a judgment.", "End the coaching session and reschedule for a later date."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing resistance requires empathy and collaboration. Acknowledging the parent's concerns and working together to find a solution is more effective than confrontation or avoidance."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In a case study discussed, a parent of a 10-year-old boy reported difficulty with bedtime routines. After applying the THRIVE model, what was a likely outcome?",
            "options": ["The child immediately started following the bedtime routine without any resistance.", "The parent and child collaboratively created a bedtime routine that addressed both their needs, leading to improved compliance and reduced conflict.", "The coach implemented a strict reward system to enforce the bedtime routine.", "The parent decided to stop enforcing a bedtime routine altogether."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE model emphasizes collaboration and understanding. A likely outcome is a mutually agreed-upon routine that addresses both parent and child needs."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "You are coaching a single father who is overwhelmed with work and parenting responsibilities. He states, 'I just don't have time for all these positive parenting techniques!' What is the MOST appropriate response?",
            "options": ["'You need to prioritize your child's needs over your work responsibilities.'", "'I understand you're feeling overwhelmed. Let's identify one small, manageable change you can implement this week and build from there.'", "'Positive parenting techniques don't require much time; you're just making excuses.'", "'Perhaps you should consider hiring a nanny to help with childcare.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the parent's feelings and focusing on small, manageable changes is a more realistic and supportive approach. It avoids adding to the parent's stress and promotes a sense of accomplishment."

            "id": "q9_10",

            "options": ["Immediately revert to the previous parenting methods.", "Thoroughly reassess the situation, considering potential unintended consequences and making necessary adjustments to the strategy.", "Assume the child is deliberately trying to sabotage the parent's efforts.", "Refer the child to a behavioral therapist."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to reassess and adjust strategies based on their impact. Worsening behavior could indicate unintended consequences or a need for further refinement of the approach."
