            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the primary goal of cognitive reframing in the context of positive parenting?",
            "options": ["Suppressing negative emotions in children.", "Changing the way parents and children perceive and interpret events.", "Ignoring challenging behaviors.", "Enforcing stricter disciplinary measures."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive reframing focuses on altering perceptions and interpretations, not suppressing emotions or ignoring behaviors. It's about finding a more constructive perspective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A parent consistently interprets their child's occasional defiance as a sign of disrespect and future delinquency. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Balanced parenting.", "A helpful attribution style.", "A negative thought pattern.", "Effective communication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This is a classic example of a negative thought pattern, specifically catastrophizing and assuming the worst. Reframing would involve considering alternative explanations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of parents report experiencing significant stress related to managing challenging child behaviors before implementing reframing techniques?",
            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Around 50%", "Over 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that a substantial majority of parents (over 75%) report high stress levels before using reframing techniques to manage challenging behaviors more effectively."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In the context of reframing challenging behaviors, 'seeing the need behind the deed' involves:",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior entirely.", "Understanding the underlying emotional or developmental need driving the behavior.", "Punishing the behavior but acknowledging the child's feelings.", "Simply labeling the behavior as 'attention-seeking'."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This approach emphasizes understanding the root cause of the behavior, such as a need for attention, connection, or mastery, rather than just focusing on the behavior itself."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a benefit of cultivating empathy through reframing?",
            "options": ["Improved parent-child communication.", "Increased parental understanding of the child's perspective.", "Reduced parental stress and frustration.", "Elimination of all conflict between parent and child."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While reframing and empathy can significantly reduce conflict, it's unrealistic to expect that it will eliminate all conflict entirely. Conflict is a normal part of relationships."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A parent believes that their child 'should' be able to handle a specific task independently by a certain age, even though the child struggles. Reframing this expectation involves:",
            "options": ["Lowering expectations to avoid disappointment.", "Comparing the child to other children of the same age.", "Evaluating the child's actual developmental level and adjusting expectations accordingly.", "Ignoring the child's struggles and insisting they try harder."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reframing parental expectations involves a realistic assessment of the child's abilities and adjusting expectations to be more developmentally appropriate and supportive."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to the module, which reframing technique is MOST effective for promoting resilience in children facing academic setbacks?",
            "options": ["Minimizing the importance of academic achievement.", "Encouraging a fixed mindset about intelligence.", "Focusing on effort, learning, and growth rather than solely on grades.", "Blaming external factors for the child's struggles."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Promoting a growth mindset, where effort and learning are valued, is crucial for resilience. This helps children see setbacks as opportunities for growth, not as failures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of using the 'positive spin' reframing technique?",
            "options": ["Ignoring a child's negative behavior.", "Finding something positive or beneficial in a challenging situation.", "Blaming the child for a negative outcome.", "Avoiding difficult conversations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'positive spin' involves actively seeking out the positive aspects or potential benefits within a difficult or challenging situation, helping to shift perspective."

        {
            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "In the THRIVE framework, how does reframing contribute to the 'Resilience' component?",
            "options": ["By encouraging avoidance of challenging situations.", "By helping parents and children develop more adaptive and optimistic perspectives.", "By suppressing negative emotions.", "By focusing solely on external rewards."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing fosters resilience by enabling individuals to view challenges as opportunities for growth, learn from setbacks, and maintain a positive outlook, contributing to overall psychological well-being."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 7-year-old, is consistently late for school. A parent using reframing would FIRST try to:",
            "options": ["Punish Sarah for her tardiness.", "Understand the reasons behind Sarah's lateness (e.g., difficulty getting ready, anxiety).", "Ignore the lateness, hoping it will resolve on its own.", "Compare Sarah to other children who are punctual."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial step in reframing is to understand the underlying causes of the behavior. This allows for a more empathetic and effective response, addressing the root issue rather than simply punishing the symptom."
