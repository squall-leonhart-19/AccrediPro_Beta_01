            "question": "When tailoring the THRIVE framework for single-parent families, which of the following is the MOST critical initial step?",
            "options": ["Immediately implementing time-management strategies.", "Assessing the parent's support system and available resources.", "Focusing solely on the child's academic performance.", "Encouraging the parent to find a romantic partner."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing the support system is crucial as single parents often face unique challenges due to limited resources and increased responsibilities.

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "According to Attachment Theory, a parent consistently dismissing a child's emotional needs is MOST likely to foster which attachment style in the child?",
            "options": ["Secure Attachment", "Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment", "Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment", "Fearful-Avoidant Attachment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistently dismissing a child's emotional needs is a hallmark of dismissive-avoidant attachment. These children learn to suppress their emotions to avoid rejection. Bowlby's original work on Attachment Theory (1969) detailed the long-term effects of such parenting behaviors."

            "options": ["Implementing immediate consequences to deter future outbursts.", "Understanding the underlying triggers and unmet needs driving the behavior.", "Ignoring the behavior to avoid reinforcing it.", "Blaming the child for their lack of self-control."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Time-management skills for each parent.", "Re-establishing a romantic relationship between the parents.", "Focusing on the child's needs and well-being above all else.", "Encouraging the parents to compete for the child's affection."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In high-conflict co-parenting, keeping the child's needs as the central focus is paramount. This helps to minimize the negative impact of the conflict on the child's development. A 2018 study in the Journal of Divorce & Remarriage found that children in high-conflict co-parenting situations experienced better outcomes when parents prioritized their needs."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Disclosing confidential information without consent directly violates the principle of autonomy, which respects the client's right to make their own decisions and control their personal information. Ethical guidelines from the APA and ACA emphasize the importance of client confidentiality."

Addressing the parent's triggers allows for a more calm and effective response to the child's behavior. Case studies consistently show that addressing parental stress improves child outcomes."
