            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY focus of a Polyvagal-informed assessment?",
            "options": ["Identifying specific mental health diagnoses.", "Evaluating the client's capacity for social engagement and self-regulation.", "Measuring the client's IQ and cognitive abilities.", "Determining the client's personality type."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polyvagal-informed assessment focuses on understanding the client's autonomic nervous system state and its impact on social engagement and self-regulation, rather than traditional diagnostic labeling."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The State Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ) primarily assesses:",
            "options": ["Trait-based personality characteristics.", "Momentary fluctuations in physiological arousal and emotional state.", "Long-term patterns of coping and resilience.", "Cognitive distortions related to anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SRQ is designed to capture the client's current, momentary experience of regulation, providing a snapshot of their physiological and emotional state."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client scores low on the Polyvagal Safety Scale (PSS). This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["High levels of social engagement and connection.", "Difficulty perceiving cues of safety in the environment and in relationships.", "A strong reliance on the sympathetic nervous system for protection.", "An overactive parasympathetic nervous system leading to social withdrawal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low PSS scores suggest a reduced ability to detect safety cues, potentially leading to increased vigilance and difficulty forming secure attachments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to Porges' work, which facial expression is MOST closely associated with a mobilized state (fight or flight)?",
            "options": ["A genuine, Duchenne smile.", "A flat or constricted affect with minimal eye contact.", "Hypervigilance with furrowed brow and tense jaw.", "A relaxed and open expression with frequent blinking."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypervigilance, a furrowed brow, and tense jaw are indicative of a mobilized state, reflecting activation of the sympathetic nervous system in preparation for fight or flight."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which aspect of vocal prosody is MOST indicative of a safe and social engagement system being activated?",
            "options": ["Monotone speech with rapid rate.", "High-pitched, wavering voice.", "Melodic and expressive tone with moderate pace.", "Abrupt shifts in volume and pitch."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A melodic and expressive tone, spoken at a moderate pace, is associated with the ventral vagal pathway and signals safety and connection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "What does Heart Rate Variability (HRV) primarily reflect in the context of Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["The strength of the heart muscle.", "The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity.", "The speed at which the heart beats.", "The amount of oxygen in the blood."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HRV reflects the dynamic interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system, providing insights into regulatory capacity."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client's SRQ scores fluctuate significantly throughout the day, with high scores during social interactions and low scores when alone. According to the SAFE Framework™, this suggests:",
            "options": ["A highly resilient autonomic nervous system.", "Difficulty maintaining a consistent state of regulation across different contexts.", "A strong preference for social interaction over solitude.", "A potential misinterpretation of social cues."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Significant fluctuations in SRQ scores indicate difficulty maintaining a stable regulatory state, suggesting potential challenges in adapting to different social contexts. This aligns with the Engagement aspect of the SAFE Framework™."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which of the following physiological measures, when used in conjunction with HRV biofeedback, can provide additional insights into a client's autonomic state?",
            "options": ["Blood glucose levels.", "Electrodermal activity (EDA).", "Respiratory rate.", "Both Electrodermal activity (EDA) and Respiratory rate."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Both EDA and respiratory rate can provide complementary information about the client's autonomic arousal and regulation, enhancing the effectiveness of HRV biofeedback."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A researcher is studying the effectiveness of a new Polyvagal-informed intervention for individuals with social anxiety. Which assessment tool would be MOST appropriate for measuring changes in perceived safety and social connectedness?",
            "options": ["The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).", "The Polyvagal Safety Scale (PSS).", "The Rorschach Inkblot Test.", "The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Polyvagal Safety Scale (PSS) is specifically designed to assess an individual's perception of safety and social connectedness, making it the most appropriate tool for this research question."

            "options": ["Objectively validate physiological data.", "Understand the meaning and context behind physiological responses.", "Minimize the influence of therapist bias.", "Replace quantitative data with qualitative insights."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating client narratives allows clinicians to gain a deeper understanding of how individuals interpret and experience their physiological states, enriching the assessment process and informing treatment strategies."
