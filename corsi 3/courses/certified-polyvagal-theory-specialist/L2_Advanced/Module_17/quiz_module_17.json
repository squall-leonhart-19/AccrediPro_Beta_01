            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client with a history of trauma presents with both anxiety and depression. Which polyvagal principle is MOST important to address FIRST?",
            "options": ["Mobilization through exercise", "Social engagement to build trust", "Identifying and regulating triggers", "Cognitive restructuring of negative thoughts"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and connection through social engagement is paramount before addressing triggers or challenging cognitions in trauma-affected clients. This aligns with the hierarchical nature of the autonomic nervous system as described by Porges."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of using polyvagal theory to support a client with chronic pain?",
            "options": ["Eliminating pain completely", "Increasing reliance on pain medication", "Shifting the nervous system out of a persistent state of defense", "Encouraging the client to ignore the pain signals"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal is to help the client's nervous system move out of a sustained defensive state (fight, flight, or freeze) to reduce the perceived threat and, consequently, the pain experience. This is supported by research showing a link between chronic pain and autonomic dysregulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a typical autonomic response seen in individuals struggling with addiction?",
            "options": ["Increased heart rate variability (HRV)", "Decreased vagal tone", "Heightened sympathetic nervous system activity", "Difficulties in self-regulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Addiction is often associated with decreased HRV and vagal tone, indicating a less flexible and resilient nervous system. Increased HRV is a sign of autonomic flexibility and regulation, not typically found in addiction."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "When working with an autistic client, which of the following strategies would be MOST helpful in fostering a sense of safety?",
            "options": ["Encouraging intense eye contact to build connection", "Predictable routines and clear communication", "Sudden changes in the environment to promote adaptability", "Minimizing sensory input to avoid overwhelming the client"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic individuals often thrive on predictability and clear communication. Establishing routines and providing clear expectations can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of safety and control."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A parent consistently responds to their child's distress with anger and criticism. According to polyvagal theory, what is the MOST likely impact on the child's developing nervous system?",
            "options": ["Enhanced vagal regulation and resilience", "Increased capacity for social engagement", "A heightened sense of safety and security", "A chronic state of defensiveness and hypervigilance"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Consistent exposure to parental anger and criticism can lead to a chronic state of defensiveness and hypervigilance in the child, as the nervous system learns to anticipate threat rather than safety and connection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which attachment style is MOST likely to be associated with a chronically dysregulated autonomic nervous system?",
            "options": ["Secure attachment", "Anxious-preoccupied attachment", "Autonomous attachment", "Dismissive-avoidant attachment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anxious-preoccupied attachment is characterized by a heightened sensitivity to perceived threats and a constant need for reassurance, often leading to chronic autonomic dysregulation and difficulty regulating emotions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client discloses engaging in self-harm. What is the FIRST ethical consideration you should address?",
            "options": ["Immediately informing the client's family", "Assessing the client's immediate safety and risk of suicide", "Documenting the disclosure in the client's file", "Confronting the client about the dangers of self-harm"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing the client's immediate safety and risk of suicide is the priority. This involves evaluating the intent, plan, and means of self-harm, and taking appropriate steps to ensure the client's well-being, while documenting the disclosure."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' the client with fibromyalgia, what specific polyvagal exercise was MOST effective in reducing her pain levels?",
            "options": ["Vigorous aerobic exercise", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "Diaphragmatic breathing and humming", "Cognitive restructuring techniques"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing and humming directly stimulate the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and reducing the perception of pain in 'Sarah's' case. This aligns with research on vagal nerve stimulation and pain management."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the 'Addictions and Recovery' lesson, what percentage of individuals in early recovery exhibit significantly reduced heart rate variability (HRV)?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 70-80% of individuals in early recovery demonstrate significantly reduced HRV, highlighting the impact of addiction on autonomic regulation and the potential for polyvagal-informed interventions to improve HRV and support recovery."

            "options": ["Teaching clients self-regulation techniques", "Facilitating co-regulation exercises with clients and their families", "Prescribing medication to manage anxiety", "Helping clients identify and manage triggers"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prescribing medication is outside the scope of practice for a Certified Polyvagal Theory Specialist™. Medication management requires specific medical training and licensure."
