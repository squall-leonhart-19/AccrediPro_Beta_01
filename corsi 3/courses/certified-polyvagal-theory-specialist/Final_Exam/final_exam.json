        "Parasympathetic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal pathway is associated with social engagement, connection, and feelings of safety. Activation of this pathway promotes calm and prosocial behaviors."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_2",
      "question": "In the S.A.F.E. Framework™, what is the primary goal of the 'Assess Activation' stage?",
      "options": [
        "To immediately regulate the client's nervous system.",

        "To encourage the client to suppress their emotional responses.",
        "To promote intense emotional catharsis."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'Assess Activation' stage focuses on understanding the client's current autonomic state, triggers, and habitual patterns of response without judgment or immediate attempts at regulation. This involves careful observation and sensitive inquiry."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Self-regulation refers to the ability to manage one's own emotional and physiological state independently, while co-regulation involves regulating one's state in interaction with another person. Co-regulation experiences can support the development of self-regulation skills."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_17",
      "question": "Why is it important to understand ethical considerations related to scope of practice when using Polyvagal Theory?",
