            "question": "Which of the following is a primary goal when initially assessing a client's autonomic state according to Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["To immediately identify the root cause of their dysregulation.", "To establish a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship.", "To challenge their maladaptive coping mechanisms.", "To diagnose specific mental health disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety is paramount. A secure therapeutic relationship allows for more accurate and in-depth assessment over time."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "When observing nonverbal cues, which of the following is the MOST indicative of a dorsal vagal shutdown state?",
            "options": ["Rapid speech and fidgeting.", "Dilated pupils and increased heart rate.", "A flat affect, slumped posture, and minimal eye contact.", "Increased muscle tension and shallow breathing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dorsal vagal shutdown is characterized by a withdrawal from social engagement, presenting as a flat affect and physical stillness."

            "question": "The <span class=\"highlight\">SAFE Framework™</span> emphasizes which key elements in the assessment process?",
            "options": ["Speed, Accuracy, Focus, Efficiency", "Safety, Awareness, Focus, Engagement", "Support, Acceptance, Flexibility, Empathy", "Structure, Analysis, Feedback, Evaluation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The SAFE Framework™ prioritizes Safety, Awareness, Focus, and Engagement to create an optimal environment for autonomic regulation and assessment."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'numb' and 'disconnected' from their body. According to Polyvagal Theory, this is MOST likely indicative of which autonomic state?",
            "options": ["Ventral vagal activation.", "Sympathetic arousal.", "Dorsal vagal shutdown.", "A regulated state."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness and disconnection are hallmark signs of dorsal vagal shutdown, a state of immobilization and withdrawal."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following physiological measures provides the MOST direct indication of vagal tone and parasympathetic nervous system activity?",
            "options": ["Blood pressure.", "Skin conductance response.", "Respiratory rate.", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "HRV reflects the variation in time intervals between heartbeats, providing a reliable index of vagal influence on the heart."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In the Autonomic Mapping Exercise, what is the PRIMARY purpose of identifying triggers?",
            "options": ["To eliminate all potential stressors from the client's life.", "To understand the specific stimuli that shift the client between autonomic states.", "To encourage the client to suppress their emotional reactions.", "To reinforce cognitive control over physiological responses."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying triggers helps understand the specific events or situations that activate different autonomic states, allowing for targeted interventions."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A client scores high on a self-reporting questionnaire for anxiety and hypervigilance. According to Polyvagal Theory, this suggests a dominance of which autonomic state?",
            "options": ["Ventral vagal engagement.", "Dorsal vagal shutdown.", "Sympathetic arousal.", "A balanced autonomic profile."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anxiety and hypervigilance are characteristic of sympathetic arousal, the fight-or-flight response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "When using physiological measures in assessment, what is a critical consideration for clients with a history of trauma?",
            "options": ["Avoiding any discussion of traumatic events during the assessment.", "Ensuring the client is fully informed about the process and has control over when to start and stop.", "Pushing the client to reach their maximum physiological capacity to identify their limits.", "Interpreting physiological data without considering the client's subjective experience."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed assessment requires prioritizing safety and control for the client. Full transparency and agency are essential."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 35-year-old client, presents with chronic pain and social withdrawal. During an autonomic mapping exercise, she identifies crowded places as a trigger for feeling 'frozen' and 'unable to speak.' This pattern MOST likely indicates a shift towards which autonomic state in those situations?",
            "options": ["Ventral vagal engagement.", "Sympathetic arousal.", "Dorsal vagal shutdown.", "A regulated state."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feeling 'frozen' and 'unable to speak' are classic indicators of dorsal vagal shutdown, a state of immobilization often triggered by overwhelming situations."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A therapist notices a client consistently avoids eye contact and speaks in a monotone voice during sessions. To effectively integrate this observation into the SAFE Framework™, what should be the therapist's NEXT step?",
            "options": ["Immediately confront the client about their avoidance behavior.", "Explore potential safety concerns or past experiences that might contribute to this behavior.", "Assume the client is being dishonest or withholding information.", "Refer the client to a specialist for further evaluation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Following the SAFE Framework™, the therapist should prioritize safety and awareness by exploring potential reasons behind the client's behavior, fostering a sense of security and understanding."
