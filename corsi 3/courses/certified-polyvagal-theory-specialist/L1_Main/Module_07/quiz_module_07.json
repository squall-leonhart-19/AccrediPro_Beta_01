        {
            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "According to the Autonomic Ladder framework, which autonomic state is characterized by immobilization, shutdown, and feelings of hopelessness?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal", "Sympathetic", "Dorsal Vagal", "Neuroception"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is associated with immobilization behaviors, feelings of shutdown, and, in extreme cases, hopelessness. This is a survival mechanism activated when perceived threat is overwhelming."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently presents with a tense jaw, rapid speech, and fidgeting during sessions. According to Polyvagal Theory, which autonomic state is Sarah likely primarily operating from?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal", "Dorsal Vagal", "Sympathetic", "A blend of Ventral and Sympathetic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tense jaw, rapid speech, and fidgeting are indicators of Sympathetic activation, often associated with fight-or-flight responses to perceived threats or stressors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY role of co-regulation in the therapeutic relationship, according to Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["To control the client's emotions directly.", "To provide a predictable and safe environment that allows the client's nervous system to downregulate.", "To avoid any emotional expression to remain neutral.", "To challenge the client's beliefs about safety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation provides a safe and predictable environment, allowing the client's nervous system to downregulate from states of threat or anxiety into a more regulated Ventral Vagal state. It is NOT about control, but about creating safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'resource' in the context of sensing safety, as discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["A stressful work environment", "A history of trauma", "A supportive relationship", "Chronic pain"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A resource is anything that promotes a sense of safety, security, and connection. A supportive relationship provides social engagement and reduces feelings of isolation, contributing to a sense of safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'numb' and disconnected from their body. Which self-reporting tool would be MOST appropriate for initially assessing their level of autonomic activation?",
            "options": ["The State Social Behavior Scale (SSBS)", "A Polyvagal-informed body scan", "The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)", "The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) questionnaire"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Polyvagal-informed body scan is ideal for bringing awareness to bodily sensations and identifying areas of tension, numbness, or discomfort, which can indicate autonomic state. The other tools address different aspects of functioning."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Which activity is MOST likely to promote Ventral Vagal engagement and a sense of 'flow'?",
            "options": ["Running a marathon", "Engaging in a competitive debate", "Singing in a choir", "Watching a suspenseful movie"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Singing in a choir promotes social engagement, breath regulation, and a sense of connection, all of which support Ventral Vagal activation and can induce a state of 'flow'. The other options are more likely to trigger sympathetic or dorsal vagal responses."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the key principle of 'embodying resilience' in the context of Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["Suppressing difficult emotions", "Developing the capacity to move flexibly between autonomic states.", "Avoiding situations that trigger sympathetic activation.", "Focusing solely on positive experiences"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Embodying resilience involves increasing the flexibility and range of the autonomic nervous system, allowing individuals to navigate stressors and challenges more effectively by moving between states as needed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "When setting goals with a Polyvagal-informed approach, what is the PRIMARY focus?",
            "options": ["Achieving ambitious outcomes", "Creating goals that prioritize safety and connection.", "Ignoring past traumas", "Setting goals based on societal expectations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polyvagal-informed goal setting prioritizes creating goals that are aligned with the client's nervous system's need for safety and connection. This allows for sustainable progress and reduces the likelihood of triggering defensive states."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is working with a client who has a history of complex trauma. The client begins to dissociate during a session. Ethically, what is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue with the planned intervention despite the dissociation.", "Gently guide the client back to the present moment using grounding techniques and assess their comfort level before proceeding.", "Immediately terminate the session and refer the client to a psychiatrist.", "Challenge the client's dissociation to encourage them to face their trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client dissociates, it is crucial to prioritize their safety and well-being. Grounding techniques can help bring them back to the present moment. Assess their comfort level and proceed at a pace that feels safe for them. Referring to a psychiatrist is not always necessary unless the dissociation is severe or persistent."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which of the following activities falls OUTSIDE the typical scope of practice for a Certified Polyvagal Theory Specialist™?",
            "options": ["Facilitating group workshops on Polyvagal Theory.", "Providing individual coaching sessions to help clients understand and regulate their nervous systems.", "Prescribing medication for anxiety or depression.", "Using Polyvagal principles to inform therapeutic interventions within their existing professional license."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prescribing medication is outside the scope of practice for a Certified Polyvagal Theory Specialist™ unless they also hold a license as a medical doctor or psychiatrist. Polyvagal Theory Specialists focus on education, coaching, and integrating Polyvagal principles into existing therapeutic practices."
