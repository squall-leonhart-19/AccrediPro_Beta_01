            "question": "Which of the following best describes the core principle of applying a Polyvagal-informed lens?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on conscious awareness of emotions.", "Primarily targeting cognitive restructuring techniques.", "Understanding behavior as a response to perceived safety or threat, mediated by the autonomic nervous system.", "Ignoring the role of social engagement in emotional regulation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Polyvagal-informed lens emphasizes the autonomic nervous system's role in shaping our responses to perceived safety and threat, recognizing that behavior is often an unconscious reaction to these cues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "Advanced neuroception, as discussed in the module, refers to:",
            "options": ["Consciously identifying specific triggers of anxiety.", "The subconscious process of evaluating safety and threat in the environment, even without conscious awareness.", "Using biofeedback to directly control heart rate variability.", "Relying solely on verbal communication to assess another person's emotional state."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced neuroception encompasses the subtle, often unconscious, evaluation of environmental cues that signal safety or danger, influencing our physiological and behavioral responses."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "In the context of co-regulation, what is a key factor that can hinder effective co-regulation dynamics?",
            "options": ["Having a strong sense of personal autonomy.", "The presence of mismatched autonomic states between individuals.", "Clear and direct verbal communication.", "A shared history of positive social interactions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mismatched autonomic states, where one person is highly activated and the other is calm, can impede co-regulation, as the activated individual may struggle to resonate with the calmer state."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in SAFE Framework™ focuses on establishing and nurturing a sense of safety, both internally and within the therapeutic setting, as a foundation for further exploration and healing."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "'Assess Activation' in the SAFE Framework™ centers on cultivating awareness of autonomic states, recognizing the subtle cues that indicate varying levels of arousal in oneself and others."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and disconnected during group therapy sessions. Applying the SAFE Framework™, which initial step would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encourage the client to immediately share their feelings with the group.", "Help the client identify subtle cues of activation (e.g., increased heart rate, shallow breathing) as part of 'Assess Activation'.", "Suggest the client leave the group immediately to avoid further distress.", "Advise the client to focus on positive thoughts to counteract negative feelings."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beginning with 'Assess Activation' allows the client to become more aware of their physiological responses, providing a foundation for managing their experience within the group setting. "

            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A therapist using a Polyvagal-informed approach notices a client consistently avoids eye contact and speaks in a monotone voice. What might this suggest about the client's autonomic state?",
            "options": ["The client is likely experiencing a high degree of social engagement and connection.", "The client's vagal brake is likely highly active, potentially indicating a dorsal vagal shutdown response.", "The client is intentionally being rude and disrespectful.", "The client is simply introverted and prefers not to engage socially."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Avoidance of eye contact and a monotone voice can be indicators of a dorsal vagal response, suggesting the client may be experiencing a shutdown or withdrawal response due to perceived threat or overwhelm."
