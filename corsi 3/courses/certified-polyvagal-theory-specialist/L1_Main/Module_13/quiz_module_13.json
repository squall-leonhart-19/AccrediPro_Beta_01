        {
            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a core component of advanced co-regulation techniques, as discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["Attunement", "Resonance", "Mirroring", "Cognitive Restructuring"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring, while valuable, is not a primary element of co-regulation as defined within the Polyvagal framework. Attunement, resonance, and mirroring are crucial for establishing a felt sense of safety and connection."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client reports difficulty identifying internal body sensations. Which practice would be MOST appropriate as an initial step in cultivating interoceptive awareness?",
            "options": ["Vigorous exercise", "Body scan meditation with gentle guidance", "Ice water immersion", "Engaging in a debate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body scan meditation, with gentle guidance, helps clients gradually tune into internal sensations without overwhelming the nervous system. Vigorous exercise or ice water immersion could potentially trigger a defensive response, and engaging in debate is irrelevant."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the primary role of movement in regulating the autonomic nervous system?",
            "options": ["To deplete excess energy", "To signal safety and promote social engagement", "To induce a fight-or-flight response", "To increase heart rate variability at all costs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhythmic, intentional movements can signal safety to the nervous system and promote a shift towards social engagement. While exercise can deplete energy, the primary goal is not simply depletion, and inducing a fight-or-flight response is counterproductive."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In the context of attachment theory and the Polyvagal System, what is 'earned secure attachment'?",
            "options": ["Attachment security achieved through genetic predisposition", "Attachment security developed later in life through positive relational experiences", "Attachment security that is bought or bartered for", "Attachment security that is only possible in childhood"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Earned secure attachment refers to the development of secure attachment patterns in adulthood, often through therapeutic relationships or other positive relational experiences that repair earlier attachment wounds."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which communication style is MOST likely to activate the ventral vagal pathway in another person?",
            "options": ["A monotone voice with minimal eye contact", "A loud, assertive voice with direct commands", "A gentle, melodic voice with warm facial expressions and shared gaze", "Rapid-fire questions with no pauses"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gentle, melodic voice, combined with warm facial expressions and shared gaze, are all cues of safety that activate the ventral vagal pathway, promoting connection and social engagement."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "What is the bidirectional relationship between the vagal nerve and the gut-brain axis primarily responsible for?",
            "options": ["Regulating blood sugar levels", "Influencing immune function, inflammation, and emotional regulation", "Controlling motor movements", "Filtering toxins from the bloodstream"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vagal nerve and gut-brain axis communicate bidirectionally, significantly influencing immune function, inflammation, and emotional regulation. This connection highlights the importance of addressing both gut health and nervous system regulation."

            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Which of the following mindfulness practices is MOST directly related to Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["Analytical meditation", "Open monitoring meditation focusing on interoceptive awareness", "Transcendental meditation", "Walking meditation in a crowded area"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Open monitoring meditation, specifically focusing on interoceptive awareness, aligns most closely with Polyvagal Theory by cultivating awareness of internal bodily sensations and their connection to emotional states."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the SAFE Framework™, what does the 'E' represent?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the SAFE Framework™, 'E' stands for Engagement, referring to fostering social connection and interaction to promote a sense of safety and belonging."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 42, presents with chronic anxiety and digestive issues. Applying a Polyvagal-informed approach, what would be an appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescribing an anti-anxiety medication", "Recommending a high-intensity workout routine", "Guiding her through a diaphragmatic breathing exercise and gentle body scan", "Advising her to avoid all social interactions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing and gentle body scans are gentle, accessible interventions that can help regulate the nervous system and improve interoceptive awareness, addressing both anxiety and digestive issues. Medication and high-intensity workouts may be too activating initially."

            "options": ["Increased reactivity to stress", "Decreased ability to regulate emotions", "Improved social engagement and resilience", "Higher levels of inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study by Porges et al. (2023) demonstrated that individuals with higher vagal tone exhibited improved social engagement and resilience, highlighting the protective role of the vagal nerve in navigating stress and fostering connection."
