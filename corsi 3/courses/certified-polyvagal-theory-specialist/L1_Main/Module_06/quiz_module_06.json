        {
            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the autonomic nervous system is associated with social engagement and feeling safe?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Pathway", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Ventral Vagal Pathway", "Parasympathetic Nervous System"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Pathway is associated with social engagement, connection, and feeling safe."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "What is the primary function of neuroception?",
            "options": ["Consciously evaluating threats", "Unconsciously detecting safety and threat cues", "Regulating heart rate variability", "Controlling muscle movement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the unconscious process by which our nervous system assesses safety and threat in the environment."

            "question": "In the SAFE framework, what does 'A' stand for?",
            "options": ["Activate Social Engagement", "Assess Activation", "Apply Autonomic Regulation", "Avoidance of Triggers"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'A' in the SAFE framework stands for Assess Activation, which involves recognizing and understanding the client's current state of autonomic arousal."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a co-regulation strategy?",
            "options": ["Isolating oneself to manage emotions", "Yelling to assert dominance", "Engaging in reciprocal, attuned interactions", "Ignoring another person's distress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation involves reciprocal, attuned interactions that help individuals regulate their emotional states. This typically involves empathy, active listening, and mirroring."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'numb' and disconnected. According to Polyvagal Theory, which autonomic state is MOST likely being expressed?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)", "Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)", "Dorsal Vagal (Immobilization)", "Neuroception Activated"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal state is often associated with feeling numb, shut down, and disconnected, representing a state of immobilization."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Which communication skill is MOST aligned with Polyvagal-informed practice?",
            "options": ["Interrupting frequently to offer solutions", "Using a monotone voice to remain neutral", "Active listening and validating the client's experience", "Avoiding emotional topics to prevent distress"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Polyvagal-informed communication emphasizes active listening, validation, and creating a sense of safety through tone of voice and body language."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "What is a key consideration when working with trauma from a Polyvagal perspective?",
            "options": ["Forcing clients to confront traumatic memories immediately", "Understanding how trauma impacts autonomic regulation", "Ignoring the client's physical sensations", "Focusing solely on cognitive restructuring"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Polyvagal perspective on trauma emphasizes understanding how traumatic experiences can dysregulate the autonomic nervous system and the importance of restoring a sense of safety and connection."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "In a case study, a client with anxiety consistently misinterprets neutral facial expressions as hostile. This BEST illustrates a disruption in:",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal Tone", "Sympathetic Arousal Threshold", "Neuroception", "Dorsal Vagal Response"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Misinterpreting social cues, like facial expressions, suggests an issue with neuroception, the unconscious detection of safety and threat."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A therapist notices their own heart rate increasing and feeling slightly anxious during a session with a highly agitated client. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Countertransference", "Co-regulation", "Neuroceptive Drift", "Sympathetic Resonance"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sympathetic resonance refers to the phenomenon where one person's autonomic state influences another's, often observed as a therapist mirroring a client's anxiety."

            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Which ethical principle is MOST relevant when applying Polyvagal Theory in practice?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Justice"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-maleficence (do no harm) is paramount, as interventions that are not carefully considered and implemented can potentially retraumatize clients by overwhelming their nervous system. Prioritizing safety and client well-being is crucial."
