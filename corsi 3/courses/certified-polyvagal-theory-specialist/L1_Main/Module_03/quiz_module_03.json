            "question": "According to Csikszentmihalyi's research, what is the key characteristic of an activity that makes it more likely to induce a flow state?",
            "options": ["High level of relaxation and ease", "A clear balance between challenge and skill", "Complete absence of feedback", "Minimal cognitive demand"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Csikszentmihalyi's research emphasizes that flow occurs when the challenge of an activity is well-matched to one's skill level, creating a sense of focused engagement."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which of the following sensory experiences is LEAST likely to enhance a flow state, based on the principles discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["Listening to binaural beats", "Engaging in mindful movement with nature sounds", "Working in a dimly lit, monochrome environment", "Using aromatherapy with calming scents"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dimly lit, monochrome environments are generally not conducive to flow, as they lack the sensory stimulation that can enhance focus and engagement. Flow is often enhanced by rich sensory experiences."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the context of the SAFE framework, how does 'Find Flow' primarily contribute to building a sense of connection and safety?",
            "options": ["By inducing a state of hyperarousal and vigilance", "By promoting social interaction and communication", "By downregulating the nervous system and fostering a sense of calm", "By increasing cognitive load and problem-solving abilities"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Finding flow contributes to the SAFE framework by downregulating the nervous system. Activities that induce flow often promote relaxation, reduce anxiety, and foster a sense of inner peace, contributing to feeling safe and connected."

            "options": ["Encouraging Sarah to immediately pursue complex artistic projects", "Guiding Sarah to identify small, achievable activities that align with her interests", "Recommending a high-intensity workout routine", "Suggesting complete isolation from sensory input"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with small, achievable activities is crucial for individuals who are easily overwhelmed. This approach allows them to gradually build confidence and experience flow in a manageable way."

            "options": ["Serotonin", "Dopamine", "Norepinephrine", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flow experiences are associated with increased dopamine release in the brain, a neurotransmitter linked to pleasure, motivation, and reward."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An autotelic experience refers to engaging in an activity for its own sake, finding intrinsic enjoyment and satisfaction in the process rather than focusing on external rewards or outcomes."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to the module, how can incorporating elements of 'surprise' into an environment contribute to flow?",
            "options": ["By minimizing distractions and promoting predictability", "By increasing the level of challenge and requiring constant adaptation", "By reducing cognitive load and simplifying decision-making", "By creating a sense of novelty and stimulating curiosity"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Introducing elements of surprise can enhance flow by stimulating curiosity and creating a sense of novelty, which can increase engagement and focus. However, the surprise should not be overwhelming or disruptive."

            "options": ["Levels of cortisol", "Symptoms of anxiety", "Overall life satisfaction", "Need for external validation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that regular engagement in flow activities is correlated with a <span class=\"highlight\">stat-highlight\">25%</span> increase in overall life satisfaction, likely due to the positive emotions and sense of accomplishment associated with flow experiences."
