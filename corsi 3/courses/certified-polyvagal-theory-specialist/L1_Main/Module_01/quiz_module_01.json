            "question": "What is the primary goal of co-regulation in a therapeutic setting?",
            "options": ["To enforce compliance with therapy goals", "To help the client manage their own emotional state through connection with the therapist's regulated state", "To diagnose underlying psychological disorders", "To provide direct advice and solutions to the client's problems"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation involves the therapist using their own regulated nervous system to help the client regulate theirs, fostering a sense of safety and connection. Research from Field, T. (2010) supports this."

            "options": ["Ventral Vagal engagement", "Sympathetic arousal", "Dorsal Vagal shutdown", "Cognitive restructuring"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Withdrawal, lack of eye contact, and monotone voice are often signs of Dorsal Vagal shutdown, a state of immobilization and disconnection. Porges, S.W. (2007) describes this state in detail."

            "question": "A 2023 study found that therapists who actively practice mindfulness and self-compassion techniques report a <span class='stat-highlight'>25% reduction</span> in burnout symptoms. How does this relate to the 'S' (Sense Safety) component of the SAFE Framework™?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A therapist's own sense of safety and well-being directly impacts their ability to create a safe environment for clients. Self-care is not selfish; it's essential for effective practice. This aligns with the principle that a regulated therapist can better co-regulate with their clients."
