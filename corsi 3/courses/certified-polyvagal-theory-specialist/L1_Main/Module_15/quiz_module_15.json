            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of advanced co-regulation, moving beyond basic techniques?",
            "options": ["Mimicking the client's emotional state to build rapport.", "Creating a completely calm and neutral environment regardless of the client's state.", "Using nuanced attunement to facilitate the client's shift towards a more regulated state, even amidst dysregulation.", "Providing direct instructions on how to breathe and relax."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced co-regulation involves nuanced attunement, meeting the client where they are and gently guiding them towards regulation, rather than simply mirroring or suppressing emotions."

            "question": "A client reports difficulty distinguishing between anxiety and excitement. Which interoceptive exercise would be MOST appropriate to begin with?",
            "options": ["Intense physical exercise followed by mindful cooldown.", "Guided meditation focusing on breath retention.", "Body scan meditation focusing on neutral sensations like the feeling of clothes on skin.", "Exposure to highly stimulating environments to differentiate responses."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting with neutral sensations allows the client to build awareness without the added complexity of strong emotional states, fostering a foundation for differentiating more nuanced feelings."

            "question": "In polyvagal-informed communication, what is the primary goal of 'verbal vagal engagement'?",
            "options": ["To assert dominance and control in the conversation.", "To convey safety and trustworthiness through tone, rhythm, and prosody.", "To avoid expressing vulnerability or emotion.", "To provide logical arguments to persuade the other person."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Verbal vagal engagement focuses on using vocal qualities that signal safety and promote connection, activating the listener's social engagement system."

            "options": ["Eliminating all potential threats from the environment.", "Creating consistent eye contact, regardless of cultural norms.", "A felt sense of safety and connection with others.", "Providing constant stimulation to keep the nervous system activated."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The social engagement system functions optimally when individuals feel safe and connected, allowing for social interaction and communication."

            "options": ["Encouraging them to push through the discomfort to process the trauma fully.", "Immediately stopping the session and avoiding the topic in the future.", "Guiding them to focus on a safe and resourcing memory or sensation before returning to the traumatic material briefly.", "Using paradoxical intention to amplify the anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves working with small, manageable doses of traumatic material, interspersed with periods of resourcing and safety, to avoid overwhelming the nervous system."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST reflects the polyvagal perspective on self-compassion?",
            "options": ["Self-compassion is a sign of weakness and should be avoided.", "Self-compassion activates the dorsal vagal pathway, leading to shutdown.", "Self-compassion involves intentionally activating the ventral vagal pathway to soothe and regulate the nervous system.", "Self-compassion is only effective if practiced in a group setting."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "From a polyvagal perspective, self-compassion involves activating the ventral vagal pathway, promoting feelings of safety, connection, and self-soothing."
