            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of <span class=\"highlight\">informed consent</span> in the context of gut health consultations?",
            "options": ["A client's agreement to a proposed treatment after the practitioner has disclosed all relevant information, including potential risks and benefits.", "A signed document stating the client understands the practitioner's qualifications.", "A verbal agreement to proceed with a general wellness plan.", "A guarantee from the practitioner that the client will experience specific positive outcomes."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires full disclosure of risks, benefits, and alternatives, allowing the client to make an autonomous decision. It's not simply a signature or a verbal agreement."

            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A gut health specialist is approached by a journalist seeking information about a high-profile client's treatment plan. What is the MOST ETHICAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Provide the journalist with anonymized data, removing the client's name but including details about their condition.", "Refuse to provide any information, citing client confidentiality.", "Confirm that the client is receiving treatment but decline to provide any further details.", "Contact the client and ask for their permission to speak with the journalist."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining client confidentiality is paramount. Even anonymized data could potentially identify the client, and disclosure without explicit consent is unethical."

            "question": "According to the lessons, what is a key difference between a <span class=\"highlight\">boundary violation</span> and a <span class=\"highlight\">boundary crossing</span>?",
            "options": ["A boundary violation is always intentional, while a boundary crossing is always unintentional.", "A boundary violation is potentially harmful or exploitative, while a boundary crossing may be harmless or even helpful.", "A boundary violation involves physical contact, while a boundary crossing does not.", "There is no significant difference; the terms are interchangeable."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boundary violations are inherently harmful and exploit the power differential in the therapeutic relationship. Boundary crossings are less severe and may not always be negative."

            "explanation": "Promising guaranteed cures is unethical and misleading, as it sets unrealistic expectations and exploits vulnerable individuals seeking relief from chronic conditions."
