            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "A client reports initial success with a gut healing protocol but experiences a plateau after 6 weeks. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately introduce a more restrictive diet.", "Re-evaluate the client's adherence to the protocol and identify potential hidden stressors.", "Prescribe a stronger dose of probiotics.", "Recommend a colonic cleanse to remove accumulated toxins."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plateaus often indicate underlying adherence issues or unaddressed stressors. Re-evaluating adherence and identifying hidden stressors is crucial before escalating interventions. A thorough assessment can reveal factors hindering progress."
