            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "When synthesizing assessment data, which of the following is the MOST critical first step in creating a personalized gut health treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Recommending a broad-spectrum probiotic.", "Identifying and prioritizing the client's key imbalances and health goals.", "Immediately implementing a restrictive elimination diet.", "Ordering advanced stool testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing imbalances and goals ensures the treatment plan directly addresses the client's specific needs and concerns, leading to greater adherence and effectiveness."

        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, 45, reports experiencing chronic bloating, fatigue, and brain fog. Her initial assessment reveals a history of antibiotic use and a diet high in processed foods. Which foundational lifestyle intervention should be prioritized FIRST?",
            "options": ["Implementing a SIBO-specific diet.", "Focusing on stress management techniques and improving sleep hygiene.", "Introducing a high-dose prebiotic supplement.", "Prescribing digestive enzymes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing stress and sleep are fundamental for overall health and can significantly impact gut function. Addressing these factors first can create a more receptive environment for other interventions."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on optimizing nutrition for gut health, what is the recommended initial approach for introducing resistant starch into the diet?",
            "options": ["Immediately incorporating large quantities of raw potatoes.", "Gradually increasing intake from sources like cooked and cooled potatoes or rice.", "Completely avoiding all starchy foods.", "Supplementing with pure resistant starch powder at a high dose."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual introduction minimizes digestive discomfort and allows the gut microbiota to adapt, preventing adverse reactions like gas and bloating. Starting slowly, as discussed in the lesson, is key."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "In strategic supplementation, which of the following best describes the purpose of using digestive enzymes?",
            "options": ["To directly kill pathogenic bacteria in the gut.", "To provide a long-term solution for digestive disorders.", "To support the breakdown of food and improve nutrient absorption, especially in cases of enzyme insufficiency.", "To replace the need for dietary changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Digestive enzymes aid in the breakdown of food, improving nutrient absorption and reducing digestive symptoms, particularly when the body's natural enzyme production is insufficient. This aligns with the lesson's focus on targeted support."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A client with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) reports significant bloating and gas after consuming various prebiotic supplements. Based on the lesson on personalized prebiotic strategies, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all prebiotic supplementation.", "Switch to a different type of prebiotic, such as partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), at a lower dose.", "Increase the dosage of the current prebiotic to overwhelm the gut bacteria.", "Recommend a broad-spectrum antibiotic to eliminate the gas-producing bacteria."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PHGG is often better tolerated than other prebiotics in individuals with IBS. Starting with a lower dose and gradually increasing it, as discussed in the lesson, can improve tolerance and efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "In addressing complex cases like SIBO, which dietary approach is typically recommended during the initial phase of treatment?",
            "options": ["A high-FODMAP diet to feed beneficial bacteria.", "A very low-carbohydrate, elemental diet to starve the bacteria.", "A moderate-FODMAP diet with an emphasis on easily digestible foods.", "A completely liquid diet to rest the digestive system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elemental diets are sometimes used, but a very low-carbohydrate diet aimed at starving the bacteria is a common approach during the initial phase of SIBO treatment. This aligns with strategies discussed for managing SIBO."

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "When monitoring progress and adapting treatment plans, what is the recommended frequency for reassessing a client's symptoms and markers in the initial stages of a gut health intervention?",
            "options": ["Every 6-12 months.", "Every 2-4 weeks.", "Only when the client reports significant changes.", "Only after completing the entire initial treatment protocol."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequent reassessment (every 2-4 weeks) allows for timely adjustments to the treatment plan based on the client's response, ensuring optimal effectiveness and preventing potential setbacks. This aligns with the lesson's emphasis on personalized, adaptive care."

        {
            "id": "q21_8",

            "options": ["Continuing the initial high-dose supplementation regimen indefinitely.", "Gradually reintroducing previously restricted foods while monitoring for symptom recurrence.", "Strictly adhering to the initial elimination diet for life.", "Discontinuing all gut health interventions and returning to their previous diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual reintroduction allows for the identification of trigger foods and promotes a more diverse and sustainable diet. This aligns with the lesson's focus on creating a balanced and enjoyable long-term eating plan."
