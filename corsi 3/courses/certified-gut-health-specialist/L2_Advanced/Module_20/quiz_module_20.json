            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of using advanced symptom questionnaires in gut health assessment?",
            "options": ["They are less expensive than stool testing.", "They provide a comprehensive view of the microbiome composition.", "They help identify patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated symptoms.", "They eliminate the need for further diagnostic testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced symptom questionnaires help identify symptom patterns and connections, guiding further investigation and personalized interventions. They do not replace other tests or directly assess the microbiome."

        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A Comprehensive Stool Analysis (CSA) with parasitology reveals elevated levels of beta-glucuronidase. This finding is MOST likely associated with:",
            "options": ["Improved detoxification of hormones and xenobiotics.", "Increased risk of estrogen reabsorption and potential hormonal imbalances.", "Optimal gut barrier function.", "Decreased inflammation in the gut."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated beta-glucuronidase activity can lead to the deconjugation of hormones like estrogen, increasing their reabsorption and potentially contributing to hormonal imbalances.  The lesson material specifically cited studies linking elevated beta-glucuronidase and increased risk of certain cancers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which type of food sensitivity testing is considered LEAST reliable due to a high rate of false positives and lack of strong scientific validation?",
            "options": ["IgG antibody testing.", "ALCAT testing.", "MRT testing.", "Skin prick testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "IgG antibody testing is often misinterpreted as indicating food allergies or intolerances, but its clinical significance is debated. Many experts consider it unreliable for identifying true food sensitivities, as highlighted in the Academy's lesson on Food Sensitivity Testing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "During a 3-hour lactulose breath test for SIBO, a patient's hydrogen levels increase by 25 ppm above baseline within the first 90 minutes. According to the North American Consensus guidelines, this suggests:",
            "options": ["A false positive result.", "A negative result for SIBO.", "A positive result for SIBO in the proximal small intestine.", "A positive result for SIBO in the distal small intestine."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An increase of 20 ppm or more above baseline within the first 90 minutes strongly suggests SIBO in the proximal small intestine, as outlined by the North American Consensus guidelines for hydrogen breath testing. A 25 ppm increase exceeds this threshold."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Elevated zonulin levels in an intestinal permeability test indicate:",
            "options": ["A healthy gut barrier function.", "Decreased intestinal inflammation.", "Increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut').", "Improved nutrient absorption."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the tight junctions between intestinal cells. Elevated zonulin levels are associated with increased intestinal permeability, often referred to as 'leaky gut.'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Which of the following markers is MOST indicative of inflammation specifically within the gastrointestinal tract?",
            "options": ["C-reactive protein (CRP).", "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).", "Fecal calprotectin.", "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fecal calprotectin is a marker of neutrophil activity in the gut and is considered a specific indicator of intestinal inflammation. CRP, ESR, and IL-6 can be elevated in systemic inflammation but are not specific to the GI tract."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "In the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, which assessment tool would be MOST relevant for evaluating the 'Restoration' phase?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Stool Analysis.", "SIBO breath test.", "Food sensitivity testing.", "Follow-up symptom questionnaires and inflammatory markers."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Restoration' phase focuses on rebuilding and maintaining a healthy gut environment. Follow-up symptom questionnaires and inflammatory markers are most relevant for monitoring progress and adjusting the restoration plan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A client presents with bloating, gas, and constipation that worsen after consuming high-FODMAP foods. Which assessment tool would be the MOST appropriate initial step?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Stool Analysis.", "SIBO breath test.", "Intestinal permeability test.", "Food sensitivity (IgG) test."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the symptoms and their association with FODMAPs, a SIBO breath test is the most appropriate initial step to rule out small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, a common cause of FODMAP intolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client's CSA reveals dysbiosis with low levels of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacteria) and elevated levels of opportunistic pathogens. According to the case studies reviewed in the module, what intervention would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic.", "Recommending a high-FODMAP diet to feed the remaining bacteria.", "Implementing a targeted probiotic protocol and dietary changes to support beneficial bacteria and reduce pathogens.", "Initiating a strict elimination diet to remove all potential food triggers."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on the case studies, a targeted probiotic protocol and dietary changes aimed at supporting beneficial bacteria and reducing opportunistic pathogens are the most appropriate interventions. This approach addresses the underlying dysbiosis without resorting to broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can further disrupt the microbiome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a CRITICAL consideration when interpreting the results of ANY gut health assessment tool?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on individual marker values without considering the overall clinical picture.", "Ignoring the patient's symptoms and medical history.", "Using a single assessment tool to make definitive diagnoses.", "Integrating the results with the patient's symptoms, medical history, and other relevant data."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A holistic approach is essential. Integrating the results with the patient's symptoms, medical history, and other relevant data ensures a more accurate and personalized interpretation. Relying solely on individual markers or a single test can lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment."
