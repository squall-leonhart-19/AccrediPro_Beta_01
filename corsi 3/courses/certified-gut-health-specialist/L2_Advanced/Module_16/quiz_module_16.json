            "question": "In the 'Complex IBS with Suspected SIBO' case study, which diagnostic test is MOST crucial to confirm the presence of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "Hydrogen Breath Test", "Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Urinalysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Hydrogen Breath Test is the gold standard for diagnosing SIBO, measuring hydrogen and methane levels produced by bacteria in the small intestine."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A client with an autoimmune condition and suspected gut permeability is experiencing increased inflammation. According to the 'Autoimmune Condition and Gut Permeability' case study, which dietary intervention is typically the FIRST step in addressing gut barrier dysfunction?",
            "options": ["High-FODMAP diet", "Strict ketogenic diet", "Elimination diet focusing on common allergens", "Prolonged fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet helps identify and remove specific food triggers that may be contributing to inflammation and gut permeability, as highlighted in the case study."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Gut Dysbiosis' case study, what percentage of individuals with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) also exhibit symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that around 50% of individuals with CFS also experience IBS-like symptoms, indicating a significant overlap between these conditions and potential gut dysbiosis."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter, heavily influenced by the gut microbiome, plays a crucial role in regulating mood and is often targeted in interventions for mood disorders, as discussed in the 'Mood Disorders and the Gut-Brain Axis' case study?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "Norepinephrine", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serotonin, with approximately 90% produced in the gut, is a key neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and is significantly influenced by the gut microbiome."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Diagnostic Interpretation' lesson, what is a critical consideration when interpreting a Comprehensive Stool Analysis result showing a high level of opportunistic bacteria?",
            "options": ["Immediately prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics", "Considering the patient's symptoms and overall clinical picture", "Ignoring the result if the patient feels well", "Recommending a fecal microbiota transplant without further investigation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's essential to correlate lab findings with the patient's symptoms and medical history. High levels of opportunistic bacteria may be normal for some individuals or indicative of a transient imbalance rather than a serious infection."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "When navigating complex supplement protocols, as outlined in the relevant lesson, what is the MOST important factor to consider before recommending multiple supplements simultaneously?",
            "options": ["The cost-effectiveness of the supplements", "Potential interactions between supplements", "The patient's preference for taking pills", "The marketing claims made by the supplement manufacturers"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding potential interactions between supplements is crucial to avoid adverse effects and ensure the safety and efficacy of the protocol. Some supplements can interfere with each other's absorption or metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "A client discloses they are simultaneously seeing another practitioner for gut health issues. According to the 'Ethical Considerations' lesson, what is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately terminate the client relationship", "Contact the other practitioner to coordinate care", "Encourage the client to choose only one practitioner", "Discuss potential conflicts of interest and ensure informed consent"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Maintaining transparency and obtaining informed consent is paramount. Discussing potential conflicts and ensuring the client understands the implications of seeing multiple practitioners is ethically sound."

            "options": ["Prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Recommending a high-fiber diet and a Bifidobacteria-specific probiotic", "Suggesting a fecal microbiota transplant", "Advising a low-carbohydrate diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antibiotic use can deplete beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria. A high-fiber diet to feed beneficial bacteria and a Bifidobacteria-specific probiotic are appropriate interventions to restore balance."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "You suspect a client has intestinal permeability ('leaky gut'). Which zonulin level result, when considered alongside other clinical data, would MOST strongly support this suspicion?",
            "options": ["Zonulin level within the normal range", "Slightly below normal zonulin level", "Significantly elevated zonulin level", "Zonulin level fluctuating wildly between tests"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin regulates tight junctions in the gut. Significantly elevated zonulin levels suggest increased intestinal permeability, allowing larger molecules to pass through the gut lining into the bloodstream."
