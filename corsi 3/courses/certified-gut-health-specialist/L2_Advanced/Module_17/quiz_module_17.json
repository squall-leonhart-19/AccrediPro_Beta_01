            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client presents with both Hashimoto's thyroiditis and suspected leaky gut. Which initial dietary approach is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["A strict ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation.", "A low-FODMAP diet to address potential SIBO.", "An autoimmune protocol (AIP) diet focusing on eliminating common trigger foods.", "A high-fiber diet to promote gut motility."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AIP diet is specifically designed to reduce inflammation and immune reactivity associated with autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's while simultaneously addressing potential gut permeability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client with SIBO and histamine intolerance is experiencing bloating, skin rashes, and headaches. Which supplement should be approached with CAUTION due to its potential to exacerbate their histamine intolerance?",
            "options": ["Probiotics containing histamine-producing strains like Lactobacillus casei.", "Digestive enzymes with betaine HCL.", "L-Glutamine to support gut lining integrity.", "Vitamin D3 to modulate immune function."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Certain probiotic strains, such as Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus bulgaricus, can produce histamine in the gut, potentially worsening symptoms in histamine-intolerant individuals."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A young woman with anorexia nervosa is experiencing severe constipation and abdominal pain. What is the MOST crucial initial step in addressing her gut health?",
            "options": ["Administering a strong laxative to relieve constipation.", "Gradually reintroducing food under medical supervision to address malnutrition and restore gut motility.", "Prescribing a course of antibiotics to eliminate potential bacterial overgrowth.", "Recommending a high-fiber supplement to increase stool bulk."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In clients with eating disorders, addressing the underlying malnutrition and restoring normal eating patterns is paramount before implementing specific gut health interventions. Premature interventions can be harmful."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to research on the gut-brain axis, which of the following neurotransmitters is MOST directly influenced by the gut microbiome and can impact neurodegenerative diseases?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "GABA", "Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiome plays a significant role in the production and regulation of serotonin, a neurotransmitter critical for mood, sleep, and cognitive function, and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "An oncology patient undergoing chemotherapy is experiencing severe mucositis and diarrhea. Which intervention is MOST appropriate to support their gut health and reduce these side effects?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic to prevent infection.", "Providing glutamine supplementation to support gut lining repair and reduce inflammation.", "Recommending a high-fiber diet to promote regular bowel movements.", "Encouraging the consumption of fermented foods to boost the immune system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutamine is an amino acid that can help repair the gut lining and reduce inflammation, which is particularly beneficial for oncology patients experiencing mucositis and diarrhea as side effects of chemotherapy. Studies suggest it can decrease the severity and duration of these symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client exposed to mold is experiencing fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues. Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in addressing their gut health?",
            "options": ["Administering a probiotic supplement to repopulate the gut microbiome.", "Identifying and eliminating the source of mold exposure.", "Prescribing an antifungal medication to kill mold in the gut.", "Implementing a low-histamine diet to reduce inflammation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Eliminating the source of mold exposure is the critical first step. Without removing the ongoing exposure, other interventions will likely be ineffective."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing digestive distress after consuming a wide range of foods, but allergy testing is negative. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step to identify potential food sensitivities?",
            "options": ["Recommending a highly restrictive elemental diet.", "Implementing a carefully planned elimination diet, followed by gradual reintroduction of foods.", "Prescribing digestive enzymes to improve food breakdown.", "Suggesting a stool test to identify gut dysbiosis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet, followed by a structured reintroduction process, is the gold standard for identifying food sensitivities when allergy testing is inconclusive. This allows for observation of symptom changes upon reintroduction of specific foods."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client taking multiple medications, including NSAIDs and antibiotics, is experiencing persistent bloating and abdominal discomfort. Which intervention should be prioritized to mitigate the impact of polypharmacy on their gut microbiome?",
            "options": ["Recommending a high-dose probiotic supplement with multiple strains.", "Consulting with the client's physician to review and potentially adjust their medication regimen.", "Implementing a strict low-FODMAP diet.", "Suggesting a course of herbal antimicrobials to eliminate potential dysbiosis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most important step is to collaborate with the client's physician to assess the necessity and potential interactions of their medications, as polypharmacy can significantly disrupt the gut microbiome and contribute to digestive symptoms. A 2018 study in *Gut Microbes* showed a strong correlation between polypharmacy and gut dysbiosis."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with suspected SIBO presents with elevated levels of both hydrogen and methane on a breath test. Which treatment approach is MOST likely to be effective?",
            "options": ["Rifaximin alone.", "Neomycin alone.", "A combination of rifaximin and neomycin.", "A low-FODMAP diet alone."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When methane is elevated in addition to hydrogen, it indicates the presence of methanogens. Rifaximin primarily targets hydrogen-producing bacteria, while neomycin targets methanogens. A combination is often necessary for effective treatment."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client with a history of bulimia nervosa is now in recovery but continues to experience gastroparesis and nutrient malabsorption. What is the MOST appropriate dietary strategy to support their gut health?",
            "options": ["A high-fiber, low-fat diet to promote gastric emptying.", "Small, frequent meals of easily digestible foods to minimize gastric distension.", "Intermittent fasting to improve insulin sensitivity.", "A ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gastroparesis, or delayed gastric emptying, is common in individuals with a history of bulimia. Small, frequent meals of easily digestible foods can help reduce the burden on the stomach and improve nutrient absorption. High-fat or high-fiber meals can exacerbate gastroparesis symptoms."
