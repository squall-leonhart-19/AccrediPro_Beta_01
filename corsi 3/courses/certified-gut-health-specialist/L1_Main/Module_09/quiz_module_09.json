            "options": [
                "A one-way communication pathway from the gut to the brain.",
                "A bidirectional communication network involving neural, hormonal, and immunological signals between the gut and the brain.",
                "Primarily regulated by the central nervous system, with minimal influence from the gut.",
                "A completely independent system where the gut and the brain operate without influencing each other."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis is a complex bidirectional network involving multiple pathways, including neural (vagus nerve), hormonal (cortisol), and immunological (cytokines) signaling."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety and digestive upset during periods of high stress. Which axis is MOST likely involved in this presentation?",
            "options": [
                "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The HPA axis is activated during stress, leading to cortisol release, which can affect both brain function (anxiety) and gut function (digestive upset)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Zonulin modulates the tight junctions between intestinal cells. Elevated zonulin levels can lead to increased intestinal permeability, allowing undigested food particles and bacteria to enter the bloodstream."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiome interacts with the immune system by influencing the development and activity of immune cells. For instance, certain bacteria promote the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which help maintain immune tolerance."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "A client experiences bloating, gas, and diarrhea after consuming dairy products, but a skin prick test for milk allergy is negative. This MOST likely indicates:",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Food sensitivities, such as lactose intolerance, involve non-IgE mediated immune responses. Symptoms can resemble allergic reactions, but allergy tests are negative."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Mediterranean-style diet, rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, promotes a diverse and balanced gut microbiome, which is linked to improved insulin sensitivity and weight management. A 2023 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) found a significant correlation (p < 0.001) between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and improved HbA1c levels."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
