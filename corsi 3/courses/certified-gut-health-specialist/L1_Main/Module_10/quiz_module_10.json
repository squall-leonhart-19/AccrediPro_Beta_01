            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary approaches is MOST likely to be effective in managing hydrogen-dominant SIBO, based on current research?",
            "options": ["A high-FODMAP diet to promote microbial diversity", "A strict ketogenic diet with minimal carbohydrates", "A low-FODMAP diet combined with targeted antimicrobial therapy", "A completely elemental diet for two weeks followed by gradual reintroduction"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet reduces substrate for bacterial fermentation, alleviating symptoms and reducing hydrogen production. Combining this with antimicrobials can be more effective than diet alone, as demonstrated in several studies."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with anxiety and chronic constipation. According to the Gut-Brain Axis module, which of the following interventions is MOST directly aimed at modulating serotonin production in the gut?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Prescribing a high dose of vitamin D", "Supplementing with a probiotic containing Bifidobacterium infantis", "Recommending a diet high in processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacterium infantis has been shown to increase tryptophan availability, a precursor to serotonin, in the gut, thereby influencing mood and gut motility. This aligns with research on the gut-brain axis's role in mental health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In addressing leaky gut, which of the following supplements has demonstrated the strongest evidence for promoting tight junction integrity in the intestinal lining?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "L-Glutamine", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Activated charcoal"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-Glutamine is a primary fuel source for enterocytes and has been shown in multiple studies to strengthen tight junctions, reducing intestinal permeability. Studies show a significant improvement in zonulin levels with L-Glutamine supplementation."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When selecting a probiotic for a client with a history of histamine intolerance, which of the following strains should be AVOIDED?",
            "options": ["Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG", "Bifidobacterium longum", "Streptococcus thermophilus", "Saccharomyces boulardii"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Streptococcus thermophilus is a known histamine producer. Individuals with histamine intolerance should avoid probiotics containing this strain to prevent adverse reactions."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client's advanced food sensitivity test reveals a high reactivity to gliadin. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Complete avoidance of all grains", "A short-term elimination of gluten-containing foods followed by a gradual reintroduction challenge", "Immediate initiation of digestive enzymes", "Focusing solely on gut-healing supplements and ignoring dietary changes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Eliminating gluten-containing foods provides the gut with an opportunity to heal. A reintroduction challenge helps determine the client's tolerance level and guide long-term dietary choices, as highlighted in the advanced food sensitivity testing module."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Research suggests that alterations in the gut microbiome play a significant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Which of the following mechanisms is MOST directly implicated in this process?",
            "options": ["Increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)", "Molecular mimicry and immune dysregulation", "Enhanced nutrient absorption", "Decreased intestinal permeability"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Molecular mimicry, where microbial peptides resemble self-antigens, can trigger an autoimmune response. Immune dysregulation, stemming from imbalanced gut microbiota, is also a key factor in autoimmune disease development."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, what does the 'R' specifically represent?",
            "options": ["Reintroduction of all foods", "Rebalancing the gut microbiome", "Removing stressors and toxins", "Repairing the gut lining"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, 'R' stands for 'Removing stressors and toxins', which is a crucial step in addressing gut health issues."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A client with chronic fatigue and suspected mitochondrial dysfunction may benefit from which of the following supplements, known for its role in cellular energy production and gut health?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)", "Vitamin K2", "5-HTP"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is essential for mitochondrial function and ATP production. Supporting mitochondrial health can improve energy levels and overall gut function. Some studies suggest a link between gut dysbiosis and impaired mitochondrial function."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A client presents with SIBO and histamine intolerance. Which of the following antimicrobials would be the MOST appropriate starting point, considering its lower risk of exacerbating histamine issues?",
            "options": ["Berberine", "Allicin", "Neomycin", "Rifaximin"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that primarily targets the gut, with a lower risk of systemic side effects and histamine release compared to other options. Berberine and Allicin, while effective antimicrobials, may trigger histamine release in sensitive individuals."

        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client with rheumatoid arthritis experiences significant gut dysbiosis. Which of the following interventions, based on the module's discussion of autoimmune disease, would be MOST directly aimed at modulating the immune response in the gut?",
            "options": ["A high-protein diet", "Supplementation with broad-spectrum antibiotics", "Introduction of specific probiotic strains known to promote immune tolerance", "Complete avoidance of all fermented foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Specific probiotic strains, such as certain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, have demonstrated the ability to modulate the immune response by promoting the production of regulatory T cells and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. This approach is more targeted and less disruptive than broad-spectrum antibiotics."
