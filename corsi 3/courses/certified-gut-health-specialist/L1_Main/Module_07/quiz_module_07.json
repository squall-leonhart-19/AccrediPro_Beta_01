        {
            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST direct route of communication within the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["The cardiovascular system", "The vagus nerve", "The lymphatic system", "The spinal cord"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve provides a direct and bidirectional communication pathway between the gut and the brain, influencing various physiological processes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Which short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) is known for being a primary energy source for colonocytes and supporting gut barrier integrity?",
            "options": ["Acetic acid", "Propionic acid", "Butyric acid", "Valeric acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Butyric acid is a crucial SCFA that nourishes colonocytes, promoting gut barrier function and overall gut health. Studies show that reduced butyrate production is linked to intestinal inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Elevated levels of which protein are MOST indicative of increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut)?",
            "options": ["Albumin", "Zonulin", "Collagen", "Elastin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin regulates the tight junctions between intestinal cells. Elevated zonulin levels suggest compromised tight junctions and increased intestinal permeability, as seen in studies by Fasano et al. (2000)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which immune cell type is MOST influenced by the gut microbiome and plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the gut?",
            "options": ["Neutrophils", "T regulatory cells (Tregs)", "Eosinophils", "Basophils"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T regulatory cells (Tregs) are significantly influenced by the gut microbiome, particularly by SCFAs like butyrate. They help maintain immune tolerance and prevent excessive inflammatory responses in the gut."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "A 35-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with eczema and reports chronic constipation. Considering the gut-skin axis, which dietary intervention would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates", "Increasing processed foods for convenience", "Increasing fiber intake and fermented foods", "Restricting all fats"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increasing fiber intake and incorporating fermented foods can improve gut motility, promote a healthy microbiome, and potentially alleviate skin conditions like eczema by addressing underlying gut imbalances. This aligns with case studies discussed in the Gut-Skin Axis lesson."

        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "Long-term use of which medication class is MOST likely to disrupt the gut microbiome and increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection?",
            "options": ["Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)", "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)", "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)", "Antihistamines"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alter the gastric environment, affecting the gut microbiome and increasing susceptibility to Clostridioides difficile infection. A meta-analysis by Freedberg et al. (2015) demonstrated a significant association between PPI use and C. difficile infection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which dietary strategy is MOST effective for reducing inflammation and promoting gut barrier repair in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?",
            "options": ["A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet", "A ketogenic diet", "An elemental diet or a low-FODMAP diet", "A diet high in processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elemental diet, or a low-FODMAP diet, reduces the fermentable substrates available to gut bacteria, decreasing gas production and inflammation. Elemental diets provide nutrients in a readily absorbable form, allowing the gut to rest and repair."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "According to the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, what does the 'F' represent in the context of gut health assessment and intervention?",
            "options": ["Fiber intake", "Functional testing", "Fecal Microbiota Transplant", "Fermented foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, 'F' stands for Functional testing. This involves using diagnostic tools to assess gut function and identify specific imbalances or dysfunctions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a client with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) experienced significant symptom reduction after implementing the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™. Which step typically follows 'L' (Lifestyle Modifications) in this framework?",
            "options": ["Optimizing diet based on food sensitivity testing", "Reassessing gut function with follow-up testing", "Introducing probiotics and prebiotics strategically", "Eliminating all potential allergens"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Following Lifestyle Modifications ('L') in the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, the next step is typically 'O' (Optimize Microbiome), which involves strategically introducing probiotics and prebiotics to support a balanced gut microbiome."

        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing bloating and gas after consuming fructans. Which of the following foods should they MOST likely limit to alleviate these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Bananas", "Blueberries", "Garlic", "Spinach"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Garlic is high in fructans, a type of FODMAP that can cause bloating and gas in sensitive individuals. Limiting garlic intake can help alleviate these symptoms."
