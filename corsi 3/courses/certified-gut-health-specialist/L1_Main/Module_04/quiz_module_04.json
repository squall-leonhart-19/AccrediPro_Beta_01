        {
            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to the 5-R protocol, which of the following is the PRIMARY goal of the 'Remove' phase?",
            "options": ["Introducing beneficial bacteria", "Eliminating stressors and irritants from the gut", "Repairing the intestinal lining", "Rebalancing the gut microbiome with prebiotics"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Remove' phase focuses on identifying and eliminating factors that negatively impact the gut, such as inflammatory foods, infections, and toxins. It sets the stage for subsequent phases of the protocol."

        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth). Which of the following dietary approaches is MOST appropriate during the initial phase of a SIBO-specific restorative protocol?",
            "options": ["High-FODMAP diet to nourish gut bacteria", "Strict ketogenic diet to starve the bacteria", "Low-FODMAP diet to reduce substrate for bacterial fermentation", "High-fiber diet to promote regular bowel movements"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet is typically recommended in the initial phase of SIBO treatment to reduce the availability of fermentable carbohydrates that fuel bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. This helps alleviate symptoms like bloating and gas."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common symptom associated with histamine intolerance that should be considered when tailoring a restorative protocol?",
            "options": ["Increased stomach acid production", "Skin rashes and hives", "Improved sleep quality", "Increased energy levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Histamine intolerance often manifests with symptoms such as skin rashes, hives, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress. These symptoms should be considered when creating a dietary and supplemental protocol to manage histamine levels."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which butyrate, a postbiotic, supports gut health?",
            "options": ["It stimulates the growth of pathogenic bacteria", "It provides energy for colonocytes and supports intestinal barrier function", "It inhibits the production of digestive enzymes", "It increases intestinal permeability"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid produced by the fermentation of dietary fiber by beneficial gut bacteria. It serves as a primary energy source for colonocytes (cells lining the colon) and plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "When reintroducing foods after an elimination diet, what is the recommended approach to identify potential food sensitivities?",
            "options": ["Reintroduce all foods at once to assess overall tolerance", "Reintroduce one food group every 1-2 days, monitoring for symptoms", "Reintroduce foods based on personal preferences", "Reintroduce foods with known allergenic potential first"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systematic reintroduction process, involving the gradual reintroduction of one food group every 1-2 days while monitoring for any adverse symptoms, is crucial for identifying specific food sensitivities and intolerances."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A client with leaky gut syndrome is considering supplementing with L-glutamine. What is the typical recommended dosage range for L-glutamine to support intestinal repair?",
            "options": ["100-200 mg per day", "500-1000 mg per day", "2-5 grams per day", "10-15 grams per day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The typical recommended dosage range for L-glutamine to support intestinal repair in leaky gut syndrome is 2-5 grams per day, divided into multiple doses. L-glutamine is an amino acid that provides fuel for intestinal cells and supports gut barrier function."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which of the following herbs is commonly used in targeted antimicrobial protocols for SIBO due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal properties?",
            "options": ["Chamomile", "Peppermint", "Berberine", "Ginger"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Berberine, found in herbs like goldenseal and barberry, exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is often used in SIBO protocols to target bacterial overgrowth. Studies have shown its effectiveness against various pathogens."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing die-off symptoms (e.g., fatigue, headache, flu-like symptoms) after starting an antimicrobial protocol. What is the MOST appropriate initial step to manage these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the antimicrobial protocol", "Increase the dosage of the antimicrobial", "Reduce the dosage of the antimicrobial and support detoxification pathways", "Add a high-dose probiotic supplement"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Die-off symptoms occur when the body is overwhelmed by the release of toxins from dying microorganisms. Reducing the dosage of the antimicrobial and supporting detoxification pathways (e.g., with binders and liver support) can help mitigate these symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important factor to consider when selecting a probiotic supplement for a client with dysbiosis?",
            "options": ["The brand's popularity", "The number of different strains and CFUs (colony-forming units)", "The cost of the supplement", "The probiotic's ability to survive stomach acid and bile"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The probiotic's ability to survive the harsh conditions of the stomach and small intestine is crucial for it to reach the colon and exert its beneficial effects. Look for strains known for acid and bile resistance and consider enteric-coated formulations."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Rebalance' phase emphasizes the importance of addressing lifestyle factors, such as stress, sleep, and exercise, to support long-term gut health and overall well-being. It recognizes the interconnectedness of the gut and the nervous system."
