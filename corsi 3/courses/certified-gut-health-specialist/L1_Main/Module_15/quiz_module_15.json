            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter, often called the 'feel-good' neurotransmitter, is primarily produced in the gut and significantly impacts mood and behavior?",
            "options": ["Norepinephrine", "Serotonin", "Dopamine", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serotonin, with approximately 90% produced in the gut, plays a crucial role in mood regulation and is a key component of the gut-brain axis. Norepinephrine, dopamine, and GABA are important neurotransmitters but not primarily produced in the gut."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms suggestive of SIBO, including bloating, gas, and abdominal pain. After a positive lactulose breath test, which dietary approach is MOST appropriate as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["High-FODMAP diet", "Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD)", "AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) diet", "Ketogenic diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) is often recommended for SIBO management as it restricts complex carbohydrates that can ferment in the small intestine, feeding the bacteria. High-FODMAP diets would exacerbate symptoms. While AIP and ketogenic diets may have other benefits, SCD is more specifically targeted at SIBO."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, which of the following gut microbiome imbalances is MOST strongly associated with the development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis?",
            "options": ["Increased levels of Bifidobacteria", "Decreased microbial diversity", "Overabundance of butyrate-producing bacteria", "High levels of Akkermansia muciniphila"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Decreased microbial diversity has been consistently linked to an increased risk and severity of autoimmune diseases. While specific bacteria may play roles, a general lack of diversity is a common factor. Some studies show Akkermansia muciniphila can be beneficial in certain contexts, but dysbiosis can also contribute to disease."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which dietary strategy is MOST effective in promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which are crucial for gut health and reducing inflammation?",
            "options": ["Increasing intake of refined sugars", "Consuming a diet high in processed foods", "Incorporating resistant starch and soluble fiber into the diet", "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resistant starch and soluble fiber serve as prebiotics, feeding beneficial gut bacteria that produce SCFAs like butyrate. Refined sugars and processed foods promote dysbiosis and inflammation. Eliminating all carbohydrates would deprive the gut bacteria of their primary food source."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which organ is considered the primary site for detoxification in the body, heavily influenced by gut health?",
            "options": ["Kidneys", "Lungs", "Liver", "Spleen"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The liver is the primary organ responsible for detoxification, processing toxins from the gut and the environment. The kidneys and lungs play roles in waste removal, but the liver handles the bulk of detoxification processes. The spleen is involved in immune function and blood filtration."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "A client is experiencing persistent gut inflammation despite dietary changes. Which supplement is BEST supported by evidence for reducing intestinal permeability ('leaky gut')?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Glutamine", "Probiotic Blend with Lactobacillus strains", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutamine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal lining and has shown promise in reducing intestinal permeability. While probiotics and omega-3 fatty acids can support gut health, glutamine has a more direct effect on leaky gut. Vitamin C is important for overall health but doesn't directly target intestinal permeability."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between the gut microbiome and estrogen levels in women?",
            "options": ["The gut microbiome has no impact on estrogen levels.", "The gut microbiome only affects estrogen levels during pregnancy.", "Certain gut bacteria produce beta-glucuronidase, which can deconjugate estrogens, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream.", "The gut microbiome directly synthesizes estrogen."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The estrobolome, a collection of gut bacteria, influences estrogen metabolism. Bacteria producing beta-glucuronidase can deconjugate estrogens, affecting their reabsorption and overall levels. This is a critical aspect of hormonal balance."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "Using the F.L.O.R.A. framework, a client presents with Fatigue, Loose stools, Overgrowth of Candida, Rash, and Anxiety. Which element of the framework should be addressed FIRST, considering the interconnectedness of these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Addressing the Candida overgrowth directly with antifungals", "Focusing solely on the anxiety with targeted supplements", "Optimizing the gut microbiome through dietary changes and probiotics", "Treating the rash with topical corticosteroids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on the F.L.O.R.A. framework, optimizing the gut microbiome is often the foundational step, as it can influence all other symptoms. Dietary changes and probiotics can help restore balance, potentially reducing Candida overgrowth, improving gut function (addressing loose stools), reducing inflammation (potentially improving the rash), and positively impacting the gut-brain axis (reducing anxiety and fatigue). Addressing symptoms in isolation may not be as effective long-term."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study (Smith et al.) found that supplementation with which of the following significantly reduced LPS-induced inflammation in the gut?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Probiotic blend containing Bifidobacterium infantis", "Curcumin", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 2023 Smith et al. study specifically highlighted the efficacy of Bifidobacterium infantis in reducing LPS-induced inflammation. While other options like curcumin may possess anti-inflammatory properties, this particular study focused on the specific probiotic strain."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "In the context of advanced detoxification strategies, which of the following is MOST crucial for supporting Phase II liver detoxification, specifically glucuronidation?",
            "options": ["Adequate hydration", "Sufficient intake of cruciferous vegetables", "High-intensity exercise", "Intermittent fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and kale contain compounds that support glucuronidation, a key Phase II liver detoxification pathway. Adequate hydration is important for overall detoxification, but cruciferous vegetables specifically support glucuronidation. High-intensity exercise and intermittent fasting may have other health benefits but are not directly linked to glucuronidation."
