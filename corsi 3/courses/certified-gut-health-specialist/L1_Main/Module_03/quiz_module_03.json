            "question": "Which of the following macronutrient ratios best reflects the 'Gut-Nourishing Plate' foundational principles, prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods and balanced nutrition?",
            "options": ["70% Carbohydrates, 15% Protein, 15% Fat", "40% Carbohydrates, 30% Protein, 30% Fat", "30% Carbohydrates, 35% Protein, 35% Fat", "20% Carbohydrates, 40% Protein, 40% Fat"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Gut-Nourishing Plate' emphasizes moderate carbohydrate intake from whole sources, with a balanced approach to protein and healthy fats to support gut health and overall wellness."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports experiencing bloating and gas after consuming fructans. Which of the following prebiotic-rich foods would be LEAST suitable for her initial gut-healing protocol?",
            "options": ["Cooked and cooled white rice", "Asparagus", "Bananas", "Oats"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asparagus is high in fructans, a type of FODMAP that can exacerbate bloating and gas in sensitive individuals. While bananas and oats contain prebiotics, they are generally better tolerated in smaller quantities. Cooked and cooled rice contains resistant starch, which can act as a prebiotic without the same FODMAP load."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the Probiotics lesson, which of the following strains has demonstrated the strongest evidence for alleviating symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)?",
            "options": ["Lactobacillus acidophilus", "Bifidobacterium infantis 35624", "Saccharomyces boulardii", "Streptococcus thermophilus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 has been extensively studied and shown to significantly reduce IBS symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and bowel movement irregularity."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Which of the following polyphenols, abundant in berries, has been shown to improve gut barrier function by increasing the production of tight junction proteins?",
            "options": ["Resveratrol", "Quercetin", "Ellagic acid", "Anthocyanins"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Anthocyanins, found in high concentrations in berries, have demonstrated the ability to enhance gut barrier integrity by promoting the synthesis of tight junction proteins, crucial for preventing leaky gut."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing skin rashes and digestive upset after consuming dairy products. After implementing an elimination diet, symptoms subside when dairy is removed. What is the MOST likely explanation for these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Lactose intolerance", "Histamine intolerance", "Gluten sensitivity", "Dairy allergy"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lactose intolerance, caused by a deficiency in the enzyme lactase, is a common cause of digestive upset after consuming dairy. Elimination diets are often used to confirm such intolerances. The skin rashes are less common in lactose intolerance than in dairy allergy, but possible."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Research suggests that a deficiency in which of the following nutrients is most strongly linked to increased anxiety and depression symptoms due to its role in serotonin production in the gut?",
            "options": ["Vitamin B12", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Magnesium", "Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter heavily influenced by the gut microbiome and vital for mood regulation. Deficiencies have been linked to increased anxiety and depression."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "When creating a personalized nutrition plan for a client with SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth), which of the following dietary approaches would be the MOST appropriate initial strategy?",
            "options": ["High-FODMAP diet to feed beneficial bacteria", "Strict ketogenic diet to starve all gut bacteria", "Low-FODMAP diet to reduce fermentation and symptoms", "High-fiber diet to promote regular bowel movements"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet is typically recommended as the initial dietary strategy for SIBO to reduce fermentation in the small intestine, alleviate symptoms, and potentially reduce bacterial overgrowth."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Betaine HCL with pepsin can help increase stomach acid levels, which are often low in individuals with heartburn, thereby improving digestion and reducing symptoms."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study showed that supplementing with digestive enzymes increased nutrient absorption by <span class=\"stat-highlight\">approximately 25%</span> in individuals with pancreatic insufficiency. Which type of digestive enzyme would be MOST beneficial for improving fat absorption in this population?",
            "options": ["Amylase", "Protease", "Lactase", "Lipase"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lipase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. Supplementation with lipase is crucial for individuals with pancreatic insufficiency to improve fat digestion and absorption."

            "options": ["Supplementing with high doses of Vitamin B12", "Implementing a whole-foods, high-fiber diet while gradually reducing processed foods", "Recommending a strict elimination diet to identify food sensitivities", "Prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic to reset the gut microbiome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A whole-foods, high-fiber diet supports a healthy gut microbiome, which can positively impact brain function and energy levels. This approach addresses the likely root cause of John's symptoms without resorting to more drastic measures like antibiotics or restrictive elimination diets as a first step."
