            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The FLORA framework provides a structured approach to gut health assessment, focusing on these five key areas."

            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial information to gather when taking a comprehensive client history for gut health?",
            "options": ["Family history of cardiovascular disease", "History of antibiotic use and gastrointestinal infections", "Client's favorite foods", "Client's exercise routine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antibiotic use and GI infections significantly impact the gut microbiome and are vital for understanding potential dysbiosis."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing bloating, gas, and abdominal pain primarily after consuming wheat-based products. Which of the following is the MOST likely initial consideration?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D deficiency", "Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)", "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or gluten sensitivity", "Hyperthyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These symptoms are commonly associated with IBS or sensitivity to gluten, warranting further investigation into these areas."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90% of the body's serotonin, a key neurotransmitter affecting mood, is produced in the gut."

            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues. Which functional gut test would be MOST appropriate to initially assess potential imbalances?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "SIBO Breath Test", "Food Sensitivity Test", "Heavy Metals Test"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive stool analysis provides a broad overview of the gut microbiome, digestive function, and potential pathogens, making it a suitable initial assessment tool."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a marker of intestinal inflammation and is often elevated in conditions like IBD."

            "question": "During a SIBO breath test, a significant rise in methane levels is MOST indicative of:",
            "options": ["Hydrogen sulfide overgrowth", "Methanogen overgrowth, potentially contributing to constipation", "Hydrogen overgrowth, potentially contributing to diarrhea", "Pancreatic enzyme insufficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Methane is produced by methanogens, and elevated levels are often associated with constipation-predominant SIBO."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 35, presents with IBS-D, anxiety, and a history of recurrent antibiotic use. Her stool analysis reveals low levels of Bifidobacteria and elevated levels of a specific pathogenic bacteria. Her SIBO test is positive for hydrogen overgrowth. Synthesizing this data, what is the MOST likely primary driver of her symptoms?",
            "options": ["Food sensitivities", "Hormonal imbalance", "Gut dysbiosis and SIBO", "Vitamin deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of IBS-D, anxiety, antibiotic history, stool analysis results, and SIBO breath test strongly points to gut dysbiosis and SIBO as the primary drivers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client's stool analysis reveals low levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Which of the following dietary interventions would be MOST appropriate to recommend?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates", "Increasing intake of prebiotic-rich foods like onions, garlic, and leeks", "Following a ketogenic diet", "Restricting fiber intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs are produced by the fermentation of fiber by gut bacteria. Prebiotic-rich foods promote the growth of beneficial bacteria that produce SCFAs."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of zonulin in gut health assessment?",
            "options": ["A marker of pancreatic enzyme activity", "A measure of intestinal permeability (leaky gut)", "An indicator of bile acid malabsorption", "A measure of stomach acid production"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin regulates tight junctions in the intestinal lining, and elevated levels suggest increased intestinal permeability, often referred to as 'leaky gut'."
