            "question": "Which of the following neurotransmitters is primarily produced in the gut and significantly influences mood regulation, highlighting a key aspect of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "Norepinephrine", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, influencing mood, sleep, and appetite. This highlights the profound impact of the gut on brain function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements. Based on the lessons, which of the following gut microbiome characteristics is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["High microbial diversity", "Predominance of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria", "Low microbial diversity and potential dysbiosis", "Balanced ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low microbial diversity is often associated with gut dysbiosis, which can lead to digestive symptoms like bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements. A healthy gut generally exhibits high diversity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Which of the following inflammatory markers is MOST directly associated with intestinal permeability ('leaky gut')?",
            "options": ["C-reactive protein (CRP)", "Zonulin", "Interleukin-6 (IL-6)", "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zonulin is a protein that modulates the permeability of tight junctions between cells of the digestive tract lining. Elevated zonulin levels are strongly correlated with increased intestinal permeability."
        },

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "According to the lessons, which of the following is a key distinction between a food allergy and a food intolerance?",
            "options": ["Food allergies always involve the immune system, while food intolerances do not.", "Food intolerances are always more severe than food allergies.", "Food allergies only manifest as gastrointestinal symptoms.", "Food intolerances are easily diagnosed with skin prick tests."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Food allergies involve an immune system response (e.g., IgE-mediated), while food intolerances typically do not. Intolerances often involve enzyme deficiencies or chemical sensitivities."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a prebiotic food that specifically promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut?",
            "options": ["Yogurt", "Kefir", "Garlic", "Sauerkraut"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Garlic contains inulin, a type of prebiotic fiber that selectively feeds beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in the gut. Yogurt and kefir are probiotic foods, and sauerkraut contains probiotics due to fermentation."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, what does the 'O' represent?",
            "options": ["Overall health", "Optimize nutrition", "Observe symptoms", "Organic foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™, 'O' stands for 'Observe symptoms'. This step involves carefully monitoring and documenting the client's symptoms to gain a deeper understanding of their gut health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A client with acne and eczema reports significant digestive issues. Considering the gut-skin axis, which intervention is MOST likely to address both skin and gut symptoms simultaneously?",
            "options": ["Topical corticosteroids for the skin", "Antibiotics for the gut", "A diet rich in fermented foods and fiber", "Strict elimination diet removing all potential allergens"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in fermented foods (probiotics) and fiber (prebiotics) can improve gut health and reduce inflammation, which can positively impact both skin conditions like acne and eczema. This approach targets the root cause of the issue by modulating the gut microbiome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis showed that supplementing with a specific strain of Bifidobacterium significantly reduced symptoms of IBS. Which of the following is the MOST accurate interpretation of this finding?",
            "options": ["All Bifidobacterium strains are equally effective for IBS.", "Probiotic supplementation is a guaranteed cure for IBS.", "Strain-specific probiotics can be effective for managing IBS symptoms.", "The study proves that IBS is solely caused by a lack of Bifidobacterium."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis highlights the importance of strain specificity when using probiotics. Different strains have different effects, and not all Bifidobacterium strains will be effective for IBS."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 35, reports chronic fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. Her F.L.O.R.A. Framework™ assessment reveals elevated zonulin levels and a history of antibiotic use. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic to eradicate potential pathogens.", "Recommend a high-sugar diet to support energy levels.", "Implement a gut-healing protocol focusing on removing inflammatory foods and supporting gut barrier function.", "Suggest a strict ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's elevated zonulin levels (indicating leaky gut) and antibiotic history (potentially disrupting the microbiome), a gut-healing protocol is the most appropriate initial intervention. This addresses the root cause of her symptoms by focusing on reducing inflammation and restoring gut barrier function."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a PRIMARY mechanism by which short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate contribute to gut health?",
            "options": ["Inhibiting the growth of all bacteria in the gut", "Providing energy for colonocytes and reducing inflammation", "Increasing intestinal permeability", "Promoting the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs, particularly butyrate, are a primary energy source for colonocytes (cells lining the colon) and have anti-inflammatory properties. They help maintain the integrity of the gut lining and reduce inflammation."
