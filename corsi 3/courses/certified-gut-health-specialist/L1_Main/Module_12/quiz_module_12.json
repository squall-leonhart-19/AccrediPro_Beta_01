            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which of the following stool markers is MOST indicative of inflammation and potential inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) when elevated?",
            "options": ["Secretory IgA", "Calprotectin", "Pancreatic Elastase", "Beta-glucuronidase"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a neutrophil-derived protein that is released into the stool during intestinal inflammation. Elevated levels strongly suggest IBD or other inflammatory conditions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of bloating, gas, and abdominal pain after consuming fermentable carbohydrates. A lactulose breath test reveals a rapid rise in hydrogen levels followed by a rise in methane levels. This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Hydrogen-dominant SIBO", "Methane-dominant SIBO (IMO)", "Hydrogen sulfide SIBO", "Pancreatic insufficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rapid rise in hydrogen followed by methane suggests a mixed SIBO/IMO picture, where hydrogen-producing bacteria are present in the small intestine, which then feed methanogens that produce methane."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter is primarily synthesized in the gut and plays a crucial role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "GABA", "Serotonin", "Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut by enterochromaffin cells. It influences various physiological processes, including mood regulation."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client with suspected leaky gut syndrome exhibits elevated levels of zonulin in their stool. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Implementing a low-FODMAP diet", "Supplementing with glutamine and zinc carnosine", "Recommending a high-fiber diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glutamine is a primary fuel source for enterocytes and zinc carnosine helps to stabilize the gut lining. These supplements can help to repair the intestinal barrier."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson, which of the following dietary strategies is MOST likely to be beneficial for managing autoimmune conditions by addressing gut health?",
            "options": ["Following a strict ketogenic diet", "Adhering to a high-lectin diet", "Implementing an elimination diet to identify trigger foods", "Consuming large quantities of dairy products for calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Elimination diets help identify specific foods that trigger immune responses and contribute to gut inflammation, which can exacerbate autoimmune conditions. Studies show improvements in autoimmune markers with targeted elimination diets."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A client with suspected histamine intolerance experiences flushing, headaches, and digestive upset after consuming fermented foods. Which enzyme is MOST likely deficient in this individual?",
            "options": ["Amylase", "Lipase", "Diamine Oxidase (DAO)", "Lactase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diamine Oxidase (DAO) is the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive tract. A deficiency in DAO can lead to histamine intolerance symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which of the following vagus nerve stimulation techniques is MOST readily accessible and can be easily incorporated into a client's daily routine?",
            "options": ["Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS)", "Surgical implantation of a vagal nerve stimulator", "Cold water immersion", "Pharmaceutical interventions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cold water immersion, particularly splashing cold water on the face, is a simple and effective way to stimulate the vagus nerve. Studies have shown it can improve heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of vagal tone."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the F.L.O.R.A. framework, what does the 'R' represent?",
            "options": ["Regenerate", "Rebalance", "Remove", "Repair"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the F.L.O.R.A. framework, 'R' stands for 'Repair', focusing on healing the gut lining and reducing inflammation."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client's stool test reveals low levels of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, along with elevated levels of opportunistic pathogens. Which of the following strategies is MOST appropriate to restore microbial balance?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Recommending a diet high in processed foods", "Implementing a targeted probiotic protocol and prebiotic-rich foods", "Suggesting a prolonged fast"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A targeted probiotic protocol with strains specific to the client’s needs, combined with prebiotic-rich foods to nourish beneficial bacteria, is the most appropriate strategy for restoring microbial balance."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, 'Sarah,' presents with chronic fatigue, joint pain, and recurrent skin rashes. Her stool test shows elevated calprotectin and dysbiosis. An elimination diet reveals sensitivities to gluten and dairy. Based on the advanced strategies discussed, what is the MOST comprehensive approach to address Sarah's gut health?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a long-term course of corticosteroids", "Focusing solely on symptom management with pain medication", "Implementing a gluten-free, dairy-free diet, supplementing with glutamine and probiotics, and incorporating vagus nerve stimulation techniques", "Recommending a high-sugar diet to improve energy levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive approach involves addressing the identified food sensitivities, repairing the gut lining with glutamine, restoring microbial balance with probiotics, and modulating the gut-brain axis through vagus nerve stimulation. This holistic strategy targets the root causes of her symptoms."
