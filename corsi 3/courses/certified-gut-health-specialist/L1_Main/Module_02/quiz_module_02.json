            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["A one-way communication pathway from the gut to the brain.", "A two-way communication pathway between the gut and the brain involving neural, hormonal, and immunological signals.", "A system primarily responsible for nutrient absorption and waste elimination.", "A communication system solely reliant on the vagus nerve."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis is a complex bidirectional communication system that involves neural pathways (vagus nerve), hormones, the immune system, and microbial metabolites."

            "question": "Which stress management technique has been shown in studies to have a direct positive impact on gut microbiota diversity?",
            "options": ["Engaging in high-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Practicing mindfulness meditation.", "Consuming a diet high in processed foods.", "Isolating oneself from social interactions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce stress hormones like cortisol, which can negatively impact gut microbiota diversity. Studies suggest it can promote a more balanced gut microbiome."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on exercise and gut health, what type of exercise is generally considered MOST beneficial for promoting gut microbiota diversity?",
            "options": ["Prolonged, high-intensity endurance training.", "Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.", "Sedentary behavior.", "Extremely heavy weightlifting."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to increase gut microbiota diversity and the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), while prolonged, high-intensity exercise may have negative effects on gut health."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindful eating emphasizes being fully present during the eating experience, paying attention to sensory details, and recognizing hunger and satiety cues to promote healthier eating habits and improved digestion."

            "options": ["Vitamin D.", "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).", "Omega-3 fatty acids.", "Probiotics."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), persistent environmental pollutants, have been shown to disrupt the gut microbiome, increase intestinal permeability, and contribute to inflammation."

            "options": ["Lower levels of beneficial gut bacteria.", "Higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "Increased gut microbiota diversity.", "Decreased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2019 study indicated that individuals with robust social support networks often exhibit greater gut microbiota diversity, which is associated with improved overall health."
