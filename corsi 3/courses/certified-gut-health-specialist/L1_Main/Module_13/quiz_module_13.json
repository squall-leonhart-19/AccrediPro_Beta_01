            "question": "Which of the following is a second-line treatment option for SIBO when initial antimicrobial protocols fail, particularly in cases with persistent methanogen overgrowth, as discussed in the advanced SIBO management lesson?",
            "options": ["L-Glutamine supplementation", "Atrantil combined with Allimax", "A low-FODMAP diet alone", "Increased fiber intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Atrantil, targeting archaea in the gut, combined with Allimax, an allicin extract, is often used as a second-line treatment, especially for methane-dominant SIBO. A study showed a significant reduction in methane levels with this combination."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In the context of the Gut-Brain Axis, which neurotransmitter is most directly influenced by gut microbial activity, and plays a crucial role in mood regulation, with approximately 90% of it being produced in the gut?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "GABA", "Serotonin", "Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Serotonin is heavily influenced by gut microbiota. It's estimated that around 90% of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, highlighting the profound connection between gut health and mood."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Beyond L-Glutamine, which of the following supplements is most effective in supporting tight junction integrity in the gut lining and reducing intestinal permeability, especially for clients with advanced leaky gut, as covered in the leaky gut strategies lesson?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Zinc Carnosine", "Probiotics", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Zinc Carnosine has been shown to enhance tight junction function and reduce intestinal permeability. Studies indicate it can significantly improve gut barrier function, making it a key supplement for leaky gut."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client presents with histamine intolerance symptoms despite following a low-histamine diet. Which enzyme deficiency is most likely contributing to their condition, requiring targeted supplementation?",
            "options": ["Amylase", "Lipase", "Diamine Oxidase (DAO)", "Lactase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diamine Oxidase (DAO) is the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down histamine in the digestive tract. A deficiency in DAO is a common cause of histamine intolerance, necessitating supplementation with DAO."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "After completing a standard anti-parasitic protocol, a client continues to experience digestive symptoms and stool testing reveals a persistent low-level parasite infection. Which of the following strategies is MOST appropriate for advanced parasite management?",
            "options": ["Repeating the same anti-parasitic protocol at a higher dose", "Implementing a biofilm disruptor combined with a different anti-parasitic agent", "Prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Reintroducing high-FODMAP foods to improve gut motility"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Biofilm disruptors are crucial for persistent parasite infections as they break down the protective matrix shielding the parasites. Combining this with a different anti-parasitic agent can improve efficacy."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between gut dysbiosis and hormone imbalances, specifically regarding estrogen metabolism, as discussed in the gut-hormone connection lesson?",
            "options": ["Gut dysbiosis has no impact on estrogen metabolism", "Certain gut bacteria produce beta-glucuronidase, which can deconjugate estrogens, leading to their reabsorption and potential estrogen dominance", "Gut bacteria only affect testosterone levels", "Probiotics always improve estrogen balance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An imbalance in gut bacteria can lead to the production of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogens, allowing them to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream and potentially contributing to estrogen dominance."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "A client with IBS presents with bloating and gas regardless of the probiotic strain used. Stool testing reveals low microbial diversity. Which probiotic strategy is MOST likely to improve their symptoms, based on the personalized probiotic strategies lesson?",
            "options": ["High-dose single-strain probiotic", "Rotating multiple probiotic strains with different functions", "Completely avoiding probiotics", "Focusing solely on prebiotic supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rotating multiple probiotic strains with different functions is often beneficial for individuals with low microbial diversity. This approach helps to repopulate the gut with a wider range of beneficial bacteria."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the FLORA Framework™, what does the 'R' represent, and how does it contribute to a comprehensive gut health strategy?",
            "options": ["'Reduce Stress': Focuses on stress management techniques to mitigate the negative impacts of stress on the gut", "'Remove': Identifies and eliminates gut irritants and pathogens contributing to dysbiosis", "'Reinoculate': Involves introducing beneficial bacteria through probiotics and prebiotics", "'Repair': Supports the healing of the gut lining and reduction of inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the FLORA Framework™, 'R' stands for 'Reinoculate', which focuses on repopulating the gut with beneficial bacteria using probiotics and prebiotics to restore microbial balance."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with symptoms of SIBO, leaky gut, and hormonal imbalances. Based on the FLORA Framework™, what is the FIRST step you should prioritize in her case?",
            "options": ["Reinoculate with a broad-spectrum probiotic", "Repair the gut lining with L-Glutamine", "Optimize her diet to reduce inflammation", "Remove potential triggers like food sensitivities or pathogens"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "According to the FLORA Framework™, the first step is always to 'Remove' potential triggers such as food sensitivities, pathogens, or other irritants that are contributing to the gut dysbiosis and inflammation."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Following an initial improvement with a low-histamine diet, a client still experiences occasional histamine reactions. Which advanced strategy, beyond dietary changes, should be considered to further manage their histamine intolerance?",
            "options": ["Increasing intake of fermented foods", "Supplementing with a mast cell stabilizer like Quercetin", "Reducing protein intake", "Increasing exercise intensity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quercetin acts as a mast cell stabilizer, reducing the release of histamine from mast cells. This can help to reduce overall histamine load and improve tolerance."
