        {
            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which stool marker is MOST indicative of generalized gut inflammation and often elevated in IBD?",
            "options": ["Calprotectin", "Secretory IgA", "Zonulin", "Pancreatic Elastase"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Calprotectin is a neutrophil-derived protein and a reliable marker of intestinal inflammation. Elevated levels strongly suggest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the North American Consensus guidelines, what is the generally accepted cutoff for a positive hydrogen breath test result in SIBO diagnosis?",
            "options": ["≥ 10 ppm increase over baseline within 90 minutes", "≥ 20 ppm increase over baseline within 90 minutes", "≥ 5 ppm increase over baseline within 120 minutes", "≥ 30 ppm increase over baseline within 120 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The North American Consensus states that a rise of ≥ 20 ppm of hydrogen over baseline within 90 minutes is indicative of SIBO. Methane requires a different interpretation."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A patient presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. An ALCAT food sensitivity test reveals high reactivity to several common foods. What is the PRIMARY limitation of relying solely on ALCAT testing for dietary recommendations?",
            "options": ["ALCAT only measures IgG antibodies, which are not always indicative of clinical reactivity.", "ALCAT testing has not been validated in peer-reviewed studies.", "ALCAT results are often inconsistent and unreliable.", "ALCAT measures cell reactivity, which might not correlate with clinical symptoms and could lead to unnecessary dietary restrictions."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While ALCAT measures cellular reactivity, it is not a validated method for identifying true food sensitivities that correlate with clinical symptoms. Over-reliance can lead to unnecessary restrictions."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences the gut-brain axis and mental health?",
            "options": ["Direct neuronal connections via the vagus nerve", "Production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA", "Regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiota influences the gut-brain axis through multiple pathways, including direct neural connections, neurotransmitter production, and HPA axis regulation."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which supplement is MOST likely to be beneficial for improving intestinal barrier function by promoting tight junction protein expression?",
            "options": ["L-Glutamine", "Probiotics", "Digestive Enzymes", "Betaine HCL"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "L-Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid that serves as a primary fuel source for enterocytes and promotes tight junction protein expression, thereby improving intestinal barrier function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Molecular mimicry is a proposed mechanism in autoimmune diseases where the immune system cross-reacts with self-antigens due to similarity with foreign antigens. Which of the following gut-related factors is MOST implicated in triggering molecular mimicry?",
            "options": ["Increased intestinal permeability ('leaky gut')", "Dysbiosis and specific bacterial strains", "Food sensitivities and intolerances", "Low stomach acid production"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dysbiosis, particularly the presence of specific bacterial strains with antigens similar to self-antigens, is strongly implicated in triggering molecular mimicry in autoimmune diseases."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which enzyme is PRIMARILY responsible for breaking down histamine in the gut?",
            "options": ["Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT)", "Diamine oxidase (DAO)", "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)", "Monoamine oxidase (MAO)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diamine oxidase (DAO) is the primary enzyme responsible for breaking down ingested histamine in the gut. Impaired DAO activity can lead to histamine intolerance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In the F.L.O.R.A. framework, what does the 'O' represent?",
            "options": ["Optimize Diet", "Overgrowth Mitigation", "Oxygenation Strategies", "Overall Wellness"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the F.L.O.R.A. framework, the 'O' represents 'Optimize Diet', emphasizing the importance of personalized nutrition in gut health management."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A patient with suspected histamine intolerance reports symptoms worsen after consuming fermented foods. Which of the following supplements would be LEAST appropriate to recommend initially?",
            "options": ["DAO enzyme", "Probiotics containing histamine-producing strains", "Quercetin", "Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Probiotics containing histamine-producing strains could exacerbate symptoms in individuals with histamine intolerance. DAO enzyme, Quercetin and Vitamin C can be beneficial."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A patient's stool test reveals low levels of Akkermansia muciniphila. Which dietary intervention is MOST likely to support the growth of this beneficial bacteria?",
            "options": ["A low-FODMAP diet", "A high-fiber diet rich in prebiotics", "A ketogenic diet", "A gluten-free diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila thrives on mucin and is supported by a high-fiber diet rich in prebiotics, which provide substrates for its growth and activity."
