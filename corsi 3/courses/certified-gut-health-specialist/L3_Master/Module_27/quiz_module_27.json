      "question": "A 30-year-old female client with acne vulgaris reports worsening symptoms after consuming dairy products. Considering the Gut Health and Skin Conditions lesson, which of the following is the MOST plausible explanation?",
      "options": [
        "Dairy products directly cause skin cell mutations leading to acne.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Dairy consumption can increase IGF-1 levels, a hormone linked to increased sebum production and inflammation, both contributing factors to acne development. This is a key concept in the gut-skin axis."
