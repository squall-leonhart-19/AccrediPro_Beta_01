            "question": "Which element of the F.L.O.R.A. Framework™ emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing underlying infections or imbalances in the gut microbiome?",
            "options": ["Foundation", "Lifestyle", "Optimization", "Restoration"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Restoration' element focuses on targeted interventions to address specific gut imbalances, including infections and dysbiosis, using strategies like antimicrobial herbs or targeted probiotics."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A client presents with SIBO and IBS-D. Advanced assessment reveals elevated hydrogen sulfide production. Which dietary modification is MOST likely to be beneficial based on this assessment?",
            "options": ["Increasing prebiotic intake", "Implementing a low-sulfur diet", "Adding resistant starch to meals", "Following a high-FODMAP diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated hydrogen sulfide suggests sulfur-reducing bacteria are contributing to symptoms. A low-sulfur diet restricts sulfur-containing foods, potentially reducing substrate for these bacteria and alleviating symptoms."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that 60-70% of IBS patients report significant symptom improvement when incorporating consistent stress management techniques, like mindfulness or yoga, into their daily routine. This highlights the gut-brain connection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-histamine diet is crucial for managing histamine intolerance. This involves avoiding high-histamine foods and those that liberate histamine in the body, reducing the overall histamine load."
