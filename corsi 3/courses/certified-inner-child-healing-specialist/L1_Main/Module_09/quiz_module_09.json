            "question": "What is the primary goal of establishing safety and trust in inner child work?",
            "options": ["To quickly resolve past traumas.", "To create a secure base for the client to explore vulnerable emotions.", "To encourage the client to immediately confront their abusers.", "To minimize the client's emotional expression."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["'Why do you think you feel anxious?'", "'Have you always felt this way?'", "'What past experiences might be contributing to these feelings?'", "'Can you describe your current relationship with your parents?'"],
