            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first step is to notice and name the specific emotions and sensations the client is experiencing, as this provides a foundation for further understanding and healing. This aligns with the case study discussed where noticing physical sensations was the starting point."

            "explanation": "Loving-kindness meditation is a gentle way to introduce self-compassion and comfort. It is a safer and more accessible starting point than directly confronting trauma or challenging negative thoughts."
