            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 35), presents with chronic anxiety and difficulty in romantic relationships. Her early childhood was marked by emotional neglect and inconsistent caregiving. Using an IFS lens, which 'part' is MOST likely driving her anxiety in relationships?",
            "options": ["A 'Firefighter' part seeking immediate relief", "An 'Exile' part holding repressed emotions", "A 'Manager' part attempting to control the relationship", "A 'Self' part seeking connection"],

            "explanation": "Given Sarah's history of emotional neglect, a 'Manager' part is likely attempting to control the relationship to avoid vulnerability and potential abandonment. This control can manifest as anxiety and difficulty trusting partners. 'Firefighters' typically react to intense emotions, not proactively cause anxiety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validating the client's feelings, even if they seem illogical, is a core component of effective reparenting. This approach provides the emotional attunement and acceptance that was lacking in childhood, fostering a sense of safety and self-worth. Dismissing or minimizing feelings perpetuates the original invalidation."
