            "question": "According to Attachment Theory, which attachment style is MOST likely to result in an individual suppressing their inner child's needs and emotions due to fear of rejection or abandonment?",

            "question": "In Internal Family Systems (IFS), what is the PRIMARY goal when working with an inner child 'exile'?",
            "options": ["To eliminate the exile's negative beliefs", "To integrate the exile into the Self", "To manage the exile's disruptive behaviors", "To suppress the exile's painful emotions"],

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client with a history of complex trauma presents with significant dissociation during inner child work. Which intervention is MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Encouraging intense emotional processing", "Grounding techniques and establishing safety", "Directly confronting the traumatic memories", "Rapidly integrating fragmented parts"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety and stabilization are paramount when working with dissociation. Grounding techniques help the client stay present and regulate their nervous system before engaging in more intense emotional work. Pushing too quickly can be re-traumatizing."

            "explanation": "Sandtray therapy allows the client to non-verbally express and process traumatic experiences through symbolic representation, providing a safe and contained space for emotional exploration and healing. The other options may not directly address trauma in a therapeutic way."
