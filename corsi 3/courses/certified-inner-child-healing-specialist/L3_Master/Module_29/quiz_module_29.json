            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 35), consistently expresses intense self-criticism during inner child sessions. Which of the following interventions would be MOST effective in addressing this shame-based behavior, according to the principles outlined in the module?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "question": "A 2023 study by Johnson et al. found that inner child work combined with somatic experiencing showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">40%</span> greater reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to somatic experiencing alone (n=60). What is a key consideration when interpreting these results?",
            "options": ["The study definitively proves inner child work is superior to all other trauma therapies.", "The results might not be generalizable to all populations due to the specific sample used.", "The placebo effect can be completely ruled out as a factor in the study's outcomes.", "The study’s findings automatically invalidate previous research on trauma treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to consider the limitations of any study, including sample characteristics and potential biases, when interpreting research findings. Generalizability is always a key consideration."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "Client, David (age 40), reports feeling disconnected from his emotions and struggles to identify his inner child's needs. He exhibits a dismissive-avoidant attachment style. Which intervention would be LEAST effective in helping David connect with his inner child?",
            "options": ["Engaging in mindfulness exercises to increase body awareness.", "Using guided imagery to visualize comforting childhood scenes.", "Encouraging him to express his emotions through journaling.", "Pushing him to immediately confront traumatic memories without establishing emotional safety."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Forcing a dismissive-avoidant client to confront trauma before establishing safety and emotional connection can be counterproductive and potentially re-traumatizing."
