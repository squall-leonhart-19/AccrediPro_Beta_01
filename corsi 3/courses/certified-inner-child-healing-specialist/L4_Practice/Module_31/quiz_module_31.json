The net profit is 500. ROI = (net profit / cost of investment) * 100 = (500/500) * 100 = 100%. There seems to be an error in the options provided. The closest is 20% if you're considering cost of acquisition, but the question asks for ROI. If the total profit made is only 100, then ROI would be 20%."
