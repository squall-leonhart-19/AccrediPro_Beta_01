            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY purpose of informed consent in equine therapy?",
            "options": ["To protect the therapist from all liability.", "To ensure the client understands the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed therapy.", "To guarantee the client's satisfaction with the therapy outcomes.", "To simplify the documentation process for insurance purposes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is fundamentally about respecting client autonomy by ensuring they have the information necessary to make a voluntary decision about their care. This aligns with the ethical principles discussed in L2."
        },
        {
            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on HIPAA and data privacy (L4), what type of client information is protected under HIPAA regulations?",
            "options": ["Client's name and address only.", "Any information that can identify a client and relates to their past, present, or future physical or mental health condition or payment for healthcare services.", "Only the client's medical diagnosis.", "Only information shared directly with medical doctors."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIPAA protects all Protected Health Information (PHI), which includes any individually identifiable health information, as defined in L4. This goes beyond just diagnosis and includes payment information."

            "options": ["The therapist's right to terminate the agreement at any time.", "Unforeseeable circumstances that prevent one or both parties from fulfilling their contractual obligations.", "A guarantee of specific therapeutic outcomes.", "A pre-determined payment schedule for services rendered."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 'force majeure' clause, as discussed in L6, excuses performance when unforeseen events (like natural disasters) make fulfilling the contract impossible. It does not relate to termination rights or outcome guarantees."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, discloses past trauma during an equine therapy session. According to ethical guidelines covered in L5, what is the therapist's PRIMARY responsibility?",
            "options": ["Immediately report the trauma to law enforcement.", "Maintain confidentiality, unless there is a legal obligation to disclose (e.g., risk of harm to self or others).", "Share the information with other therapists to gain insights.", "Encourage Sarah to immediately confront the person who caused the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining confidentiality is paramount, but therapists have a duty to report if there is a credible risk of harm, as detailed in L5. This balances client trust with legal and ethical obligations."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A risk management plan involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. Ignoring hazards or blaming the horse are not acceptable practices. Insurance is a critical part of risk management (L3)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AHA emphasizes the need for licensed healthcare professionals to obtain specific hippotherapy training and certification to ensure safe and effective practice. This combines clinical expertise with equine knowledge (L1)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Auditors will look for documented proof that informed consent was obtained and that clients understood the information provided. Signed forms and progress notes are key pieces of evidence (L8)."
