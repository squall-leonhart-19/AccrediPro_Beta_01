            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grooming and groundwork activities are often the most suitable initial approach for clients with anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most effective way to document progress in EAT is to combine standardized assessment tools (e.g., anxiety scales, depression inventories) and objective measures (e.g., heart rate variability, gait analysis) with qualitative data (e.g., client narratives, therapist observations). This mixed-methods approach provides a comprehensive and reliable picture of the client's progress."
