            "question": "A client with a history of childhood trauma begins to dissociate during an equine therapy session. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and refer the client to a psychiatrist.", "Gently guide the client back to the present moment using grounding techniques.", "Encourage the client to process the traumatic memories in detail.", "Continue the session as planned, monitoring the client's behavior."],

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allowing Sarah to observe from a distance and build trust at her own pace respects her trauma history and promotes a sense of safety. Forcing confrontation or dismissing her fear can be re-traumatizing."
