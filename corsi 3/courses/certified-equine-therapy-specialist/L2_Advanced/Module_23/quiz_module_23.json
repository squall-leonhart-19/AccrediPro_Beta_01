            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["The horse-client relationship is irrelevant to attachment wounds.", "The horse provides a consistent and non-judgmental presence, offering an opportunity to repair insecure attachment patterns.", "The horse acts as a substitute parent figure.", "The horse reinforces existing negative attachment patterns."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The horse's consistent and non-judgmental presence allows clients to experience a secure attachment figure, potentially repairing insecure attachment patterns developed in early childhood. This aligns with attachment theory principles."

            "explanation": "Observing family interactions with the horses provides valuable insights into their communication patterns.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
