            "question": "Which of the following frequencies is often associated with the heart chakra and feelings of love and compassion?",
            "options": ["174 Hz", "432 Hz", "528 Hz", "741 Hz"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "528 Hz is often linked to the heart chakra, DNA repair, and feelings of love and transformation."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "What is the primary principle behind sound <span class=\"highlight\">entrainment</span>?",
            "options": ["The tendency of two vibrating objects to vibrate at different frequencies.", "The process of dampening sound waves through interference.", "The synchronization of two or more oscillating systems.", "The amplification of sound through resonance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Entrainment is the process where two oscillating systems synchronize their frequencies due to their interaction."

            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, approximately what percentage of individuals experiencing anxiety reported a reduction in symptoms after participating in regular sound bath sessions?",
            "options": ["25%", "40%", "65%", "80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies referenced in the module suggest that around 65% of participants reported a reduction in anxiety symptoms after regular sound bath sessions."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing insomnia and high levels of stress. Which instrument and frequency range would be MOST appropriate to incorporate into their sound bath to promote relaxation?",
            "options": ["High-pitched crystal bowls around 700 Hz to stimulate energy.", "Low-frequency gongs and Tibetan singing bowls around 4-7 Hz to induce theta brainwave states.", "Rapidly played chimes to create a sense of excitement.", "Shruti box drones around 432 Hz to induce alertness."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low frequencies (4-7 Hz) are associated with theta brainwaves, which are linked to deep relaxation and sleep. Gongs and Tibetan bowls are well-suited for producing these frequencies."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What is the primary safety concern when using binaural beats in a sound bath session?",
            "options": ["Potential for hearing damage at high volumes.", "Risk of inducing seizures in individuals with epilepsy.", "Interference with pacemakers.", "Exacerbation of symptoms in individuals with hypertension."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Binaural beats can potentially trigger seizures in individuals with a history of epilepsy or seizure disorders. It's crucial to screen clients beforehand."

            "question": "Which technique involves striking a singing bowl and then immediately pressing the mallet against the rim to create a sustained, focused tone?",
            "options": ["Gating", "Rimming", "Toning", "Layering"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rimming involves striking the bowl and then running the mallet around the rim to create a continuous, resonant tone."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client mentions they have a metal implant from a recent surgery. What modification to your standard sound bath practice should you consider?",
            "options": ["Increase the volume to maximize the therapeutic effect.", "Use only crystal bowls, avoiding metal instruments.", "Maintain a greater distance between the instruments and the client, and monitor their comfort level closely.", "Recommend they reschedule until after the implant is removed."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While rare, metal implants can sometimes resonate uncomfortably. Maintaining distance and monitoring the client's comfort is the safest approach."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "What is the term for the phenomenon where sound waves constructively and destructively interfere with each other, creating areas of increased and decreased amplitude?",
            "options": ["Resonance", "Interference", "Harmonics", "Overtone Singing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interference occurs when sound waves interact, leading to constructive (increased amplitude) or destructive (decreased amplitude) effects."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "According to a case study presented in the module, a 45-year-old client named Sarah, experiencing chronic pain, reported a significant reduction in pain levels after a series of sound bath sessions incorporating which specific frequency range?",
            "options": ["250-300 Hz", "100-120 Hz", "40-60 Hz", "15-20 Hz"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study involving Sarah highlighted the effectiveness of frequencies in the 40-60 Hz range for pain management."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically considered a contraindication for sound bath participation?",
            "options": ["Pregnancy (first trimester)", "Epilepsy", "Severe mental health conditions (untreated)", "Mild anxiety"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While caution is advised for the other conditions, mild anxiety is generally not a contraindication and may even be alleviated by sound baths."
