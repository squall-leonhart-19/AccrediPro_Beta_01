            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which advanced singing bowl technique is MOST effective for directly addressing specific energetic blockages, according to Module 13's discussion?",
            "options": ["Rimming with varied pressure", "Focused tapping on specific bowl locations", "Water bowl techniques with intention", "Using multiple bowls simultaneously in a chaotic pattern"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focused tapping, especially when guided by intuition and client feedback, allows for precise targeting of energetic points. Module 13 emphasized precision over broad stimulation for specific issues."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "During a gong bath, a client reports feeling overwhelmed and agitated. Based on the 'Observe Resonance' (O) stage of SONIC, what is the MOST appropriate first action?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the gong and offer a grounding exercise.", "Continue playing at a lower volume, assuming they'll adjust.", "Ask the client to describe their experience and adjust the sound accordingly.", "Offer a pre-prepared script about the transformative power of discomfort."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Observe Resonance' stage prioritizes attentive listening and adapting to the client's experience. Direct communication and responsive adjustment of the sound are key."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A sound bath facilitator is layering Tibetan singing bowls, crystal bowls, and a gong. What is the PRIMARY consideration for maintaining harmonic coherence in this advanced sound sequencing?",
            "options": ["Ensuring each instrument is tuned to 432 Hz.", "Establishing a clear tonal center and building layers around it.", "Using instruments from the same geographical region.", "Prioritizing the loudest instrument to dominate the soundscape."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While tuning can be helpful, establishing a clear tonal center provides a foundation for harmonic relationships between the instruments. This prevents a dissonant or overwhelming sound experience."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which vocal toning technique is MOST effective for stimulating the vagus nerve and promoting relaxation, as discussed in Module 13?",
            "options": ["High-pitched, rapid chanting", "Prolonged, low-frequency humming", "Singing complex melodies with wide vocal range", "Yelling affirmations at a high volume"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency humming, particularly when sustained, stimulates the vagus nerve, which plays a key role in the parasympathetic nervous system and promotes relaxation. Studies show measurable increases in vagal tone with this technique."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "When integrating breathwork into a sound bath, what ratio of inhalation to exhalation is generally recommended to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety?",
            "options": ["1:1 (equal inhalation and exhalation)", "1:2 (exhalation twice as long as inhalation)", "2:1 (inhalation twice as long as exhalation)", "3:1 (inhalation three times as long as exhalation)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A longer exhalation activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation. The 1:2 ratio is a common starting point, but should be adapted to the client's comfort level."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "A client discloses a history of severe trauma before a sound bath. What is the MOST ethical and appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Proceed with the sound bath as planned, focusing on positive affirmations.", "Adapt the session significantly, using only gentle sounds and providing frequent reassurance.", "Refuse to provide the sound bath due to the client's trauma history.", "Encourage the client to share their trauma story in detail before beginning."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adapting the session to be gentle and reassuring is crucial for trauma-informed practice. It acknowledges the client's vulnerability and prioritizes safety and comfort. Refusal is not necessary unless the facilitator feels unequipped to handle the situation."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In the context of building a sustainable sound bath practice, what is the MOST effective strategy for attracting and retaining clients, according to the module?",
            "options": ["Offering the lowest prices in the local market.", "Focusing on niche markets and building a strong community.", "Advertising aggressively on all social media platforms.", "Promising miraculous healing results in marketing materials."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Niche marketing and community building foster loyalty and word-of-mouth referrals. It allows for specialized services and deeper connections with clients, leading to long-term sustainability. Avoid making unrealistic or misleading claims."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "What is the role of 'active listening' in the 'Observe Resonance' (O) stage of the SONIC method during a sound bath session?",
            "options": ["To identify specific musical preferences of the client.", "To diagnose underlying medical conditions based on client responses.", "To understand the client's emotional and physical responses to the sound.", "To formulate a marketing strategy based on client demographics."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active listening in this context involves paying close attention to the client's verbal and non-verbal cues to understand how they are experiencing the sound. This allows the facilitator to adjust the session to meet their needs."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A sound bath facilitator wants to incorporate binaural beats into their session. What is the MOST important consideration regarding their ethical use?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the binaural beats are subliminal and undetectable.", "Clearly informing clients about the use of binaural beats and their potential effects.", "Using binaural beats to directly influence client behavior without their knowledge.", "Promising specific and guaranteed outcomes from the use of binaural beats."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transparency and informed consent are crucial. Clients should be aware of any techniques being used and their potential effects, allowing them to make informed decisions about their participation. Avoid deception or manipulation."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A client named Sarah, 45, reports experiencing anxiety during a sound bath when a specific frequency from a crystal bowl is played. According to the 'Observe Resonance' (O) stage of SONIC, what is the MOST appropriate immediate response?",
            "options": ["Continue playing the bowl at a lower volume to desensitize her.", "Immediately stop playing that bowl and offer grounding techniques.", "Explain to Sarah that anxiety is a normal part of the healing process.", "Suggest Sarah focus on her breath and try to relax through the anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's comfort and safety is paramount. Stopping the sound and offering grounding techniques acknowledges her experience and provides a safe space for her to regulate her emotions. This aligns with trauma-informed practice principles."
