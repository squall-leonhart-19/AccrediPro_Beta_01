            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "When playing crystal bowls, which technique is MOST effective for creating a sustained, complex harmonic resonance?",
            "options": ["Striking the bowl sharply once.", "Using a soft mallet in a continuous, circular motion around the rim.", "Dampening the bowl immediately after striking.", "Placing the bowl on a thick, sound-absorbing surface."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A continuous, circular motion excites the bowl's natural frequencies, creating a rich and sustained harmonic resonance. Dampening or striking sharply limits the bowl's vibrational potential."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on gongs, what type of gong is generally BEST suited for inducing deep relaxation and facilitating emotional release?",
            "options": ["A small, high-pitched wind gong.", "A large, heavy symphonic gong with a long sustain.", "A flat, nipple gong with a clear, focused tone.", "A set of tuned gongs arranged chromatically."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Large symphonic gongs produce complex, low-frequency vibrations that are known to entrain brainwaves to slower states conducive to relaxation and emotional processing. The lesson highlighted the importance of gong size and resonance for specific therapeutic effects."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "In advanced vocal toning, what is the primary benefit of utilizing vowel sounds (e.g., 'ah,' 'oo,' 'ee') over consonant sounds?",
            "options": ["Vowel sounds are easier to pronounce.", "Vowel sounds create stronger vibrations in the body.", "Vowel sounds are inherently more spiritual.", "Consonant sounds are distracting to listeners."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vowel sounds, due to their open and sustained nature, generate more resonant vibrations within the body, impacting various tissues and energy centers. The lesson emphasized the vibrational quality of vowels for therapeutic toning."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When creating a sound bath sequence for someone experiencing anxiety, which compositional strategy would be MOST appropriate, according to the lesson on sound sequencing?",
            "options": ["Starting with loud, dissonant sounds to shock the system.", "Using a consistent, predictable rhythm throughout the session.", "Gradually introducing instruments, starting with gentle, grounding tones and building slowly.", "Focusing solely on high-frequency instruments to elevate mood."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gradual introduction of instruments with grounding tones helps to gently entrain the client to a calmer state, avoiding sudden or jarring sounds that could exacerbate anxiety. The lesson stressed the importance of pacing and tone selection for specific client needs."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'blocked' or unable to fully relax during a sound bath. Drawing from the lesson on energetic awareness, what is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately increase the volume and intensity of the instruments.", "Instruct the client to visualize the blockage dissolving.", "Gently inquire about their experience and offer grounding techniques like focused breathing.", "End the session early and suggest they try again another day."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gentle inquiry and grounding techniques are essential for addressing energetic blockages. This approach acknowledges the client's experience and provides tools for self-regulation, aligning with the principles of energetic awareness and client-centered care discussed in the lesson."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "A client with a history of trauma becomes visibly distressed during a sound bath. Based on the lesson on addressing complex client needs, what is the MOST important immediate action?",
            "options": ["Continue the sound bath as planned, as stopping might interrupt the process.", "Immediately stop the sound bath and provide a safe, supportive space for the client to process their emotions.", "Offer the client a strong sedative to calm them down.", "Encourage the client to suppress their emotions and focus on the sounds."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's safety and well-being is paramount. Stopping the session and offering a safe, supportive space allows the client to regain control and process their emotions, aligning with trauma-informed practices discussed in the lesson."

            "options": ["Sound", "Opening", "Nourishment", "Integration", "Connection"],
            "correctAnswer": 4,
            "explanation": "Within the S.O.N.I.C. Framework™, 'Connection' represents the practitioner's intention, energetic presence, and rapport with the client, all crucial for creating a safe and transformative experience."
