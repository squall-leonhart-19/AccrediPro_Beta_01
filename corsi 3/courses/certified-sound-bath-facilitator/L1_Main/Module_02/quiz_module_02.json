            "question": "What is the primary definition of resonance in the context of sound baths?",
            "options": ["The speed at which sound travels through air.", "The amplification of sound waves in a confined space.", "The sympathetic vibration of an object in response to a specific frequency.", "The dampening of sound waves by soft materials."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Resonance, in this context, refers to the sympathetic vibration of an object (including the human body) in response to a specific frequency, leading to entrainment and potential therapeutic effects."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons on observational skills, which of the following is the MOST important first step in tuning in to a client during a sound bath?",
            "options": ["Immediately start playing instruments to assess their reaction.", "Engage in active listening and observe their body language and energy.", "Ask them a series of direct questions about their emotional state.", "Dim the lights and create a relaxing atmosphere."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active listening and observation of body language and energy are crucial for establishing a baseline and understanding the client's initial state before introducing sound."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client exhibits rapid blinking and fidgeting during the initial tones of a sound bath. What might this physical manifestation suggest?",
            "options": ["Deep relaxation and meditative state.", "Anxiety, discomfort, or resistance to the sound.", "Physical discomfort unrelated to the sound.", "A natural response to the ambient lighting."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Rapid blinking and fidgeting are often indicators of anxiety, discomfort, or resistance to the sound, suggesting the need to adjust the approach or instrument."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which emotional response is MOST likely to be indicated by a client sighing deeply multiple times during a sound bath?",
            "options": ["Frustration or boredom.", "Relief or release of tension.", "Suppressed anger.", "Intense concentration."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep sighing is often associated with the release of tension or emotional burdens, suggesting the client is experiencing a sense of relief."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "In energetic assessment, what does 'scanning the aura' typically involve?",
            "options": ["Using high-frequency sound waves to map the client's energy field.", "Visually observing the client's body for physical imbalances.", "Intuitively sensing the client's energy field and identifying areas of congestion or depletion.", "Measuring the client's heart rate variability."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scanning the aura involves using intuition and sensitivity to perceive the client's energy field, identifying areas that may need attention or balancing."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Based on the case study of Sarah, who presented with anxiety, which instrument placement strategy proved MOST effective in promoting relaxation?",
            "options": ["Placing a singing bowl directly on her chest.", "Positioning gongs behind her head to create a powerful sound field.", "Using gentle chimes and tuning forks around her head and shoulders.", "Playing loud, rhythmic drum beats to ground her energy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Sarah's case, gentle chimes and tuning forks around her head and shoulders helped to calm her nervous system and promote relaxation, as opposed to more intense sounds."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Why is it important to document observations and track progress during a series of sound bath sessions?",
            "options": ["To create a legal record of the session.", "To justify the cost of the sound bath to the client.", "To personalize the approach, measure the effectiveness of the interventions, and adjust techniques as needed.", "To share client information with other practitioners."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Documenting observations allows for personalized treatment plans, measuring the effectiveness of interventions, and making necessary adjustments to techniques over time."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'ungrounded' after a sound bath session. Which instrument would be MOST appropriate to use in the next session to address this?",
            "options": ["A high-pitched crystal singing bowl.", "A deep-toned gong or drum.", "A set of wind chimes.", "A Tibetan singing bowl played softly near the heart center."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep-toned gongs or drums are often used to ground energy and connect individuals to the earth, which can help alleviate feelings of being ungrounded."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "What is the significance of 'entrainment' in the context of sound baths and brainwave activity? A 2022 study by Berger et al. showed...",
            "options": ["Entrainment has no effect on brainwave activity.", "Entrainment can synchronize brainwave frequencies to match the frequencies of the sound, potentially inducing relaxation or altered states of consciousness.", "Entrainment only affects physical sensations and does not influence brainwave patterns.", "Entrainment primarily impacts the auditory cortex and has limited effects on other brain regions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Entrainment refers to the synchronization of brainwave frequencies to external stimuli, such as sound, potentially leading to relaxation or altered states of consciousness. The study indicated a significant correlation between sound frequencies and brainwave activity."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "During a sound bath, a client begins to cry silently. According to the lessons, what is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and ask if they are okay.", "Ignore the crying and continue playing, as it may be a release of emotion.", "Gently acknowledge their emotion and offer support, while respecting their process.", "Increase the volume of the instruments to distract them from their sadness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging their emotion and offering support, while respecting their process, creates a safe and supportive environment for emotional release during the sound bath."
