            "question": "A client suddenly begins hyperventilating and reports feeling dizzy during a sound bath. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate FIRST action?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the sound bath and call emergency services.", "Guide the client in slow, deep breathing exercises while maintaining a calm presence.", "Ask the client to describe their feelings in detail to understand the trigger.", "Continue the sound bath at a lower intensity to help them regulate."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guiding the client in slow, deep breathing is the most appropriate first action to address hyperventilation and dizziness. This promotes physiological regulation. Calling emergency services immediately is premature without assessing the situation further. Encouraging detailed description might increase anxiety. Continuing at a lower intensity could exacerbate the symptoms."

            "question": "When working with a client who has disclosed a history of complex trauma, which of the following is the MOST crucial consideration for a sound bath facilitator?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the client remains fully relaxed throughout the session.", "Avoiding any sounds or vibrations that might trigger a traumatic memory or response.", "Focusing the session on releasing blocked energy from the past.", "Providing a detailed explanation of the theoretical benefits of sound healing for trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Avoiding potential triggers is paramount when working with clients with complex trauma. Full relaxation is not always achievable or safe. Focusing on past trauma without proper therapeutic support can be harmful. Detailed theoretical explanations are less important than creating a safe and predictable environment."

            "question": "A client attending a sound bath discloses that they are actively grieving the recent loss of a loved one. Which of the following approaches is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encourage the client to focus on positive affirmations to overcome their grief.", "Offer a sound bath specifically designed to 'release' grief and sadness.", "Provide a safe and supportive space for the client to experience their emotions without judgment, acknowledging their loss.", "Recommend the client seek professional counseling after the session, but avoid discussing the grief during the sound bath."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Providing a safe and supportive space is crucial for grieving clients. Encouraging positive affirmations can be dismissive of their feelings. A sound bath specifically designed to 'release' grief can be emotionally overwhelming. Ignoring the grief is invalidating. Acknowledging and validating their experience within the sound bath is important, alongside recommending professional support."

            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports an increase in pain levels immediately following a sound bath. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Advise the client that this is a normal part of the healing process and to continue attending sessions.", "Immediately stop future sessions and refer the client to a pain management specialist.", "Explore potential contributing factors with the client, such as sound intensity or body positioning, and adjust future sessions accordingly.", "Suggest the client take over-the-counter pain medication before future sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring contributing factors and adjusting future sessions is the most appropriate response. Pain increases are not always normal and should be addressed. Immediately stopping sessions might be premature. Suggesting medication without understanding the cause is not within the scope of practice."

            "question": "During a sound bath, a client confides in you that they are experiencing suicidal thoughts. According to the lesson, what is your IMMEDIATE responsibility?",
            "options": ["To offer spiritual guidance and reassurance that things will get better.", "To assess the client's immediate safety and connect them with appropriate mental health resources (e.g., crisis hotline, emergency services).", "To encourage the client to focus on the positive aspects of their life and practice gratitude.", "To continue the sound bath to help the client relax and reduce their anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing immediate safety and connecting the client with mental health resources is the primary responsibility. Spiritual guidance is not a substitute for professional mental health support. Encouraging positivity can be dismissive. Continuing the sound bath is inappropriate in this situation."

            "question": "A client who is in recovery from a substance use disorder attends a sound bath and reports feeling intense cravings afterward. What is the MOST appropriate response?",
            "options": ["Assure the client that the cravings are temporary and will pass.", "Encourage the client to use the sound bath as a replacement for substance use.", "Acknowledge the client's experience, validate their feelings, and encourage them to utilize their existing support system (e.g., sponsor, therapist).", "Suggest the client increase the frequency of sound bath sessions to combat cravings."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging, validating, and encouraging the use of their support system is the most appropriate response. Assurance alone is insufficient. Using sound baths as a replacement is not a clinically sound approach. Increasing frequency without professional guidance could be detrimental."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key adaptation to consider when facilitating a sound bath for a client with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?",
            "options": ["Using a wide range of unpredictable sounds to stimulate their senses.", "Providing clear and predictable communication about the session's structure and sounds.", "Encouraging physical touch to promote relaxation and connection.", "Maintaining a brightly lit environment to enhance sensory awareness."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing clear and predictable communication is crucial for clients with ASD. Unpredictable sounds can be overwhelming. Physical touch should be avoided without explicit consent. Bright lighting can be overstimulating."

            "options": ["Referring a client to a licensed therapist for mental health support.", "Adjusting the sound bath techniques based on the client's feedback.", "Offering unsolicited personal advice to a client regarding their relationship problems.", "Maintaining detailed records of each sound bath session for future reference."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Offering unsolicited personal advice violates ethical boundaries. Referring to a therapist is appropriate. Adjusting techniques based on feedback is client-centered. Maintaining records is good practice."

            "options": ["Less than 5%", "Around 10%", "Between 10% and 20%", "More than 30%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that between 10% and 20% of individuals experiencing bereavement may develop prolonged grief disorder (PGD), characterized by persistent and debilitating grief symptoms. It's important to be aware of this possibility when working with clients experiencing loss."

            "question": "A client with ADHD is easily distracted during a sound bath. Which of the following adjustments is MOST likely to improve their experience?",
            "options": ["Using louder and more complex soundscapes to capture their attention.", "Encouraging them to suppress any fidgeting or movement.", "Providing a designated fidget tool and a quiet, less stimulating environment.", "Instructing them to focus intently on the vibrations to improve concentration."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing a fidget tool and a quiet environment is the most helpful adjustment for clients with ADHD. Louder sounds can be overstimulating. Suppressing fidgeting is often counterproductive. Intently focusing can be difficult for individuals with ADHD."
