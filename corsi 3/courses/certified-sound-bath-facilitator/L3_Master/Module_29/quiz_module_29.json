            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing, particularly the 4-7-8 pattern, has been shown to stimulate the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and grounding, crucial during emotional release. A 2017 study in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing anxiety."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, 35, reports feeling 'stuck' and unable to process grief after the loss of a parent. Which sound frequency range is GENERALLY considered most supportive for emotional processing and release?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 120-240 Hz range resonates with the heart chakra and is often associated with emotional processing and release. While individual responses vary, this range is a common starting point for grief work. Experiential data from sound therapy sessions suggests it can facilitate emotional expression."
