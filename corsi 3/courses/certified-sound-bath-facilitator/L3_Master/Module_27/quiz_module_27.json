            "options": ["Prolonged exposure to intense sound vibrations", "Encouraging participants to share their trauma narratives during the session", "Providing a predictable and consent-based environment", "Using binaural beats to induce deep hypnotic states"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating a predictable and consent-based environment is crucial for trauma recovery, empowering individuals and fostering a sense of safety."

            "question": "A pregnant client in her second trimester reports feeling anxious about labor. Which of the following sound bath techniques is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Using high-frequency sounds to stimulate fetal development", "Focusing on grounding and calming frequencies, such as those around 432 Hz", "Employing rapid tempo changes to mirror the unpredictable nature of labor", "Placing instruments directly on the abdomen for maximum vibration"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding and calming frequencies are ideal for reducing anxiety during pregnancy. High-frequency sounds or direct instrument placement could be overstimulating or potentially harmful."

            "options": ["Using longer and more complex soundscapes", "Incorporating movement and playful elements", "Maintaining a strict and silent environment", "Focusing solely on intellectual understanding of sound vibrations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children often benefit from movement and play to engage with sound and maintain attention, which contrasts with the stillness often preferred in adult sessions."
