            "question": "Which frequency range is MOST commonly associated with inducing a theta brainwave state, often linked to deep relaxation and meditation, during a sound bath session?",
            "options": ["13-30 Hz (Beta)", "8-12 Hz (Alpha)", "4-7 Hz (Theta)", "0.5-4 Hz (Delta)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta brainwaves (4-7 Hz) are strongly associated with deep relaxation, meditation, and enhanced creativity. Using binaural beats or isochronic tones within this range can help guide participants into a meditative state."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In the context of trauma-informed sound bath facilitation, what is the PRIMARY reason for offering participants the option to keep their eyes open during the session?",
            "options": ["To encourage active participation and engagement.", "To allow for grounding and a sense of control, reducing potential feelings of vulnerability or confinement.", "To ensure participants do not fall asleep.", "To facilitate visual connection with the facilitator."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Offering the option to keep eyes open empowers participants to maintain a sense of control over their environment, which is crucial in trauma-informed practice. This helps prevent triggering feelings of vulnerability or confinement that might arise from closed-eye meditation."

            "question": "When layering instruments in a polyharmonic soundscape, what is a key consideration for creating a cohesive and immersive experience?",
            "options": ["Ensuring each instrument plays a distinct melody.", "Prioritizing volume to create a powerful sound.", "Creating complementary harmonies and rhythmic patterns that blend together.", "Using only instruments from the same cultural origin."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A cohesive polyharmonic soundscape relies on carefully crafted harmonies and rhythms that complement each other, rather than creating a cacophony of competing sounds. This allows for a deeper and more immersive experience for the participant."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety during a sound bath session. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate immediate response?",
            "options": ["Increase the volume of the instruments to drown out the anxiety.", "Encourage the client to focus on their breath and gently guide them back to the present moment, offering grounding techniques.", "Suggest the client leave the session immediately.", "Tell the client that anxiety is a normal reaction and will pass."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to support the client and help them regulate their emotions. Gentle guidance, grounding techniques, and breathwork can help bring them back to a state of presence and reduce anxiety. Ignoring or dismissing the client's experience is inappropriate and potentially harmful."

            "options": ["Speaking affirmations loudly.", "Singing simple nursery rhymes.", "Using specific vowel sounds and tones associated with each chakra.", "Humming at a random pitch."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced vocal techniques for chakra balancing involve using specific vowel sounds (e.g., 'U' for the Root Chakra) and tones that resonate with the energy centers, aiming to clear blockages and promote harmony.  This is based on the principle of vibrational resonance."

            "question": "What is the PRIMARY intention behind incorporating energy healing modalities, such as Reiki or Pranic Healing, into a sound bath session?",
            "options": ["To replace the sound bath with energy healing.", "To amplify the energetic effects of the sound, facilitating deeper healing and relaxation.", "To provide a distraction from the sounds.", "To prove the effectiveness of energy healing."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating energy healing modalities aims to enhance the energetic impact of the sound bath, working synergistically to promote deeper relaxation, emotional release, and overall well-being. The combination leverages the benefits of both sound and energy work."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced instrument techniques is MOST likely to create a sense of spaciousness and expanded awareness during a sound bath?",
            "options": ["Playing all instruments simultaneously at a high volume.", "Using long, sustained tones with gradual changes in pitch and timbre.", "Rapidly striking instruments in a complex rhythmic pattern.", "Focusing on short, percussive sounds."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long, sustained tones with subtle variations in pitch and timbre allow the sound to fully resonate and fill the space, creating a sense of spaciousness and expanded awareness. This technique encourages a deeper state of relaxation and allows participants to connect with the subtle vibrations of the sound."

            "question": "In designing a sound bath specifically for individuals with chronic pain, what is a crucial consideration regarding the sound frequencies used?",
            "options": ["Using only high-frequency sounds to stimulate the nervous system.", "Prioritizing low-frequency sounds and binaural beats in the delta and theta ranges to promote relaxation and pain reduction.", "Avoiding any use of binaural beats.", "Using a random selection of frequencies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency sounds and binaural beats in the delta and theta ranges are known to promote relaxation and can help to reduce the perception of pain. High-frequency sounds may be overstimulating for individuals with chronic pain."
