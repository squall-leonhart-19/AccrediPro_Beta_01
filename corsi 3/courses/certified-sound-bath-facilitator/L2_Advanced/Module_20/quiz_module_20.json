            "options": ["To diagnose medical conditions.", "To determine the client's favorite musical genre.", "To establish a baseline and monitor progress.", "To sell more sound therapy sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to understand the client's current state and track changes over time. This aligns with creating individualized interventions."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client reports feeling anxious and overwhelmed before a sound bath session. Which subjective assessment method would be MOST appropriate to gather more detailed information?",
            "options": ["Observational assessment during the session.", "Administering a standardized anxiety questionnaire.", "Taking physiological measures like heart rate variability (HRV).", "Asking a family member about the client's anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A standardized anxiety questionnaire provides a structured way to quantify and understand the client's anxiety level before the session."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.N.I.C. framework™, 'S' represents Symptoms, referring to the client's presenting issues and concerns."

            "options": ["Increased blood pressure", "Decreased heart rate", "Increased muscle tension", "Decreased skin conductance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A decreased heart rate is a key indicator of the relaxation response, often observed during sound bath sessions. Studies show heart rate reduction correlated with parasympathetic nervous system activation."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "In observational assessment, which of the following is an example of a NON-VERBAL cue that a client might exhibit during a sound bath session?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fidgeting or restlessness are non-verbal cues that could indicate discomfort, anxiety, or difficulty relaxing during the session."

            "question": "A 2023 study by Berger et al. found that using visual analog scales (VAS) to assess pain levels before and after sound therapy sessions showed a statistically significant reduction in pain perception (p < 0.05). This finding supports the use of VAS as a(n):",
            "options": ["Unreliable assessment tool.", "Objective assessment tool.", "Subjective assessment tool.", "Unnecessary assessment tool."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visual analog scales rely on the client's subjective perception of pain, making them a subjective assessment tool, even if the results are statistically significant."

            "options": ["Symptoms", "Observations", "Needs", "Context"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
