            "question": "Which advanced energy assessment technique involves using a pendulum to detect energy imbalances in a client's aura?",
            "options": ["Kirlian Photography", "Dowsing", "Chakra Imaging", "Biofeedback Scanning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dowsing uses a pendulum to detect subtle energy fields and imbalances. While Kirlian photography visualizes electrical discharges, it isn't directly used for energy assessment in Reiki. Chakra Imaging and Biofeedback scanning, while useful tools, are not typically part of standard Reiki practice."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "The Dai Ko Myo symbol primarily represents:",
            "options": ["Grounding and stability", "Power and protection", "Healing and transformation", "Enlightenment and connection to the divine"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Dai Ko Myo symbol is associated with enlightenment and a deeper connection to the divine source of Reiki energy. It is considered the most powerful symbol in Reiki, facilitating spiritual growth and healing at the soul level."

            "question": "According to the lesson on advanced intention setting, what percentage of Reiki practitioners report improved client outcomes when incorporating specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals into their sessions?",
            "options": ["25%", "50%", "75%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue syndrome. Which advanced Reiki technique would be MOST appropriate to address the underlying energy imbalances contributing to their condition?",
            "options": ["Gassho Meditation", "Kenyoku Dry Bathing", "Psychic Surgery", "Cellular Healing Technique"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Cellular Healing Technique targets specific cells and tissues to promote regeneration and address underlying causes of chronic conditions like fatigue. While Gassho Meditation and Kenyoku Dry Bathing are beneficial for general well-being, they don't directly address cellular-level issues. Psychic surgery is a more advanced technique and may not be suitable as a first-line approach."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key element of effective distant healing, according to the principles discussed in the Distant Healing Mastery lesson?",
            "options": ["Physical proximity to the client", "Visualizing the client in a peaceful environment", "Using crystals without specific intention", "Focusing solely on the client's symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visualizing the client in a peaceful and healing environment is crucial for establishing a strong connection and directing Reiki energy effectively. Physical proximity is not necessary for distant healing. Specific intention and focused energy are more important than simply using crystals. Focusing only on symptoms may neglect the underlying causes of the issue."

            "options": ["Strengthening the ego's control over emotions", "Weakening the connection to Reiki energy", "Transcending the limitations of the individual self", "Focusing on material possessions and achievements"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ego dissolution, in a spiritual context, means transcending the limitations and attachments of the individual self to experience a deeper connection with the universal consciousness. It involves releasing ego-driven desires and embracing humility and compassion."

            "explanation": "A clear marketing strategy is essential for attracting new clients and establishing a strong presence in the Reiki community. Networking, consistent pricing, and diverse marketing efforts are all important for business success. Relying solely on word-of-mouth can limit growth."

            "question": "Which of the following is a potential ethical consideration a Reiki Master Practitioner should be aware of when using advanced energy assessment techniques?",
            "options": ["Guaranteeing specific healing outcomes", "Sharing client information without consent", "Charging excessively high fees for services", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "All the options are ethical considerations. Promising specific outcomes is misleading, sharing client data violates privacy, and excessive fees are unethical. A practitioner should act with integrity, respect client confidentiality, and provide transparent pricing."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "A client reports feeling disconnected from their spiritual path. Which Reiki technique might be most effective in helping them reconnect?",
            "options": ["Applying Cho Ku Rei to physical pain points", "Using Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen for past-life regression", "Performing a chakra balancing with a focus on the crown chakra", "Administering Reiki without any specific intention"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Focusing on the crown chakra during a chakra balancing session can help the client open themselves to spiritual guidance and connection. The crown chakra is associated with spirituality, higher consciousness, and connection to the divine. While Hon Sha Ze Sho Nen can be used for various purposes, focusing directly on chakra balancing is more targeted. Applying Cho Ku Rei to pain points addresses physical issues, not spiritual disconnection. Reiki without intention can still be beneficial, but a focused approach is more effective."
