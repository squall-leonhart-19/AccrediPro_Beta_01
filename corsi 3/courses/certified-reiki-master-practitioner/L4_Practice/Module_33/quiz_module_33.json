            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element of informed consent when providing Reiki services?",
            "options": ["The client's signature on a consent form.", "A detailed explanation of the Reiki practitioner's personal beliefs.", "A clear description of Reiki, its potential benefits, limitations, and the client's right to refuse or withdraw consent at any time.", "A guarantee of specific health outcomes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent must include a clear description of Reiki, its potential benefits, limitations, and the client's rights. Guaranteeing outcomes is unethical and inaccurate."

            "question": "HIPAA primarily governs the handling of protected health information (PHI) by:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIPAA applies to covered entities: healthcare providers who transmit health information electronically for billing, insurance, etc. While Reiki practitioners should maintain client confidentiality, HIPAA's direct applicability depends on their electronic transaction practices."

            "question": "A Reiki practitioner advertises their services with the claim 'Reiki cures cancer.' What legal and ethical considerations are MOST relevant?",
            "options": ["This is acceptable if the practitioner genuinely believes it.", "This is permissible as long as disclaimers are included.", "This is likely illegal and unethical due to making unsubstantiated health claims.", "This is acceptable if they have testimonials from clients who claim Reiki helped their cancer."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Making unsubstantiated health claims, especially regarding serious illnesses like cancer, is illegal and unethical. It violates advertising standards and misrepresents the potential benefits of Reiki."

            "id": "q33_4",
            "question": "Which type of insurance policy would BEST protect a Reiki practitioner from financial loss due to a client alleging negligence resulting in injury?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a legal separation between the practitioner's personal assets and the business, offering protection from business debts and lawsuits. Sole proprietorships and partnerships do not offer this level of protection."

            "explanation": "Detailed client records are crucial for tracking progress, ensuring continuity of care, and providing documentation in case of legal or ethical inquiries. While HIPAA compliance is important, it is not the sole purpose."

            "options": ["To explore the feelings and see if the client reciprocates.", "To immediately terminate the professional relationship and refer the client to another practitioner.", "To continue the sessions but maintain strict professional boundaries.", "To discuss the feelings with the client and let them decide how to proceed."],

            "options": ["Breach of contract.", "Negligence.", "Defamation.", "Copyright infringement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Failure to obtain proper informed consent can be considered negligence, as it represents a failure to provide the standard of care expected of a reasonable and prudent practitioner. The client's distress is a result of this negligence."

            "explanation": "Obtaining the client's explicit written consent is essential to protect their privacy and avoid violating confidentiality. This consent should specify how and where the testimonial will be used."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reiki practitioners should not provide medical advice or diagnose illnesses. Referring the client to a licensed healthcare professional ensures they receive appropriate medical care and avoids the practitioner practicing outside their scope."
