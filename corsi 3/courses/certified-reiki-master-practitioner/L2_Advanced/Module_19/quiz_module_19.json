            "options": ["Clearly defined Reiki protocols", "The placebo effect and blinding", "Large sample sizes are easily obtained", "Consistent physiological markers for Reiki's effect"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The placebo effect and blinding are significant challenges due to the nature of Reiki and the difficulty in creating a true placebo control."
