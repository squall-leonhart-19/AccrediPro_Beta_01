            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client who recently lost their spouse reports feeling numb and disconnected. Which Reiki technique is MOST appropriate as an initial approach?",
            "options": ["Distant Reiki to strengthen their connection to the deceased.", "Directly addressing the sacral chakra to reignite passion.", "Gentle, grounding techniques focusing on the root chakra.", "Aggressively clearing blockages in the heart chakra."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques help re-establish a sense of safety and presence in the body, which is crucial for processing grief. Direct chakra manipulation may be overwhelming initially."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A trauma survivor becomes highly agitated during a Reiki session, displaying signs of a flashback. What is the FIRST and MOST important action to take?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and call emergency services.", "Continue the session while reassuring the client that they are safe.", "Gently guide the client back to the present moment using grounding techniques and verbal reassurance.", "Apply Reiki to the third eye chakra to calm their mind."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety and grounding are paramount. Guiding the client back to the present moment helps them regain control and feel safe. Continuing the session without addressing their distress could re-traumatize them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports a significant increase in pain levels after a Reiki session. What is the MOST likely explanation and appropriate response?",
            "options": ["The Reiki has stirred up deep-seated emotional issues related to the pain; advise them to continue sessions.", "The client is experiencing a healing crisis; no action is needed.", "The client may be experiencing a temporary increase in pain due to energy shifts; advise gentle self-care and monitor symptoms.", "The client is resistant to the energy; discontinue Reiki treatments."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a healing crisis is possible, a temporary increase in pain is more common. Advising gentle self-care and monitoring symptoms is the most appropriate initial response. The case study of Maria, a 48-year-old with fibromyalgia, demonstrated this effect."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the course, what percentage of participants in a study focusing on Reiki for anxiety reported a reduction in anxiety symptoms?",
            "options": ["10%", "35%", "65%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 2015 study highlighted in the course demonstrated that approximately 65% of participants experienced a reduction in anxiety symptoms after undergoing Reiki treatment."

            "options": ["Just for today, do not worry.", "Just for today, do not anger.", "Honor your parents, teachers, and elders.", "Be honest in your work."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The principle 'Just for today, do not worry' encourages focusing on the present moment and managing cravings one day at a time, which is particularly helpful in addiction recovery."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "When working with a client diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), what is a crucial modification to the standard Reiki practice?",
            "options": ["Applying firm pressure during hand placements to enhance sensory input.", "Using a consistent and predictable routine with clear communication about each step.", "Encouraging prolonged eye contact to build rapport.", "Using strong essential oils to create a calming atmosphere."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with ASD often benefit from predictability and clear communication. A consistent routine and explaining each step can minimize anxiety and promote a sense of safety. Sensory sensitivities should be considered, making firm pressure and strong scents potentially overwhelming."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Which chakra is MOST commonly associated with providing comfort and support to clients receiving end-of-life care?",

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client offers you a large sum of money in exchange for prioritizing their Reiki sessions over other clients. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Accept the money but maintain fairness in scheduling.", "Politely decline the offer and explain the importance of equitable treatment for all clients.", "Accept the money and provide the prioritized sessions, as long as it doesn't inconvenience other clients.", "Report the client to a Reiki ethics board."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining professional boundaries and treating all clients equitably is essential. Accepting the offer creates a conflict of interest and compromises ethical practice. Reporting the client is an extreme measure and not necessary unless the situation escalates."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with ADHD reports difficulty focusing during Reiki sessions. Which of the following strategies is LEAST likely to be helpful?",
            "options": ["Providing a quiet and distraction-free environment.", "Using guided meditations with a clear and concise focus.", "Encouraging frequent movement breaks during the session.", "Applying Reiki to multiple chakra points simultaneously to maximize energy flow."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Applying Reiki to multiple chakra points simultaneously can be overwhelming and counterproductive for someone with ADHD, potentially increasing feelings of being scattered and unfocused. A focused approach is generally more beneficial."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "You suspect a client is experiencing repressed trauma but they are hesitant to discuss it directly. What is the MOST appropriate approach during a Reiki session?",
            "options": ["Gently probe for details about their past traumas.", "Avoid addressing the issue entirely and focus on general well-being.", "Create a safe and supportive space, allowing the client to share at their own pace, and focus on grounding and emotional release techniques.", "Refer the client to a psychotherapist before continuing Reiki treatments."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While creating a safe space is important, if you suspect repressed trauma, referring to a psychotherapist is the most responsible action. Reiki can be a complementary therapy, but professional mental health support is crucial for addressing underlying trauma. You are not a trained therapist."
