            "options": ["To diagnose medical conditions.", "To identify energy imbalances and blockages.", "To predict future events in the client's life.", "To replace conventional medical treatments."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Reiki assessment aims to pinpoint energy imbalances that may contribute to a client's overall well-being, informing the subsequent Reiki treatment."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In advanced palpation, what sensation might indicate an area of stagnant or blocked energy?",
            "options": ["A feeling of warmth and flow.", "A pulsating rhythm.", "A cold, dense, or tingling sensation.", "A smooth, even texture."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Areas of stagnant energy are often perceived as cold, dense, or tingling during palpation. A case study in L7 highlighted a client experiencing chronic shoulder pain where the practitioner found a ‘cold spot’ during palpation which correlated with the pain location."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When using a pendulum for assessment, a clockwise motion generally indicates:",
            "options": ["A negative or blocked energy flow.", "A clear and balanced energy flow.", "The need for immediate medical attention.", "Indifference or neutrality."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A clockwise motion with a pendulum is often interpreted as a positive, open, and balanced energy flow, while a counter-clockwise motion may indicate blockage or imbalance."

            "options": ["The ability to see auras clearly.", "The ability to hear spirit guides.", "The ability to sense or feel energy and emotions.", "The ability to predict the future."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clairsentience is the ability to perceive information through feeling, including sensing energy fields, emotions, and physical sensations associated with a client's condition."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing chronic fatigue and digestive issues. How should this information be integrated into your Reiki assessment?",
            "options": ["Ignore the client's report and focus solely on energy field readings.", "Use the information to guide your palpation and intuitive scanning, focusing on areas related to digestion and energy levels.", "Immediately refer the client to a medical doctor without performing any Reiki assessment.", "Assume the client is exaggerating their symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client history is crucial for guiding your assessment. Focusing on areas related to reported symptoms allows for a more targeted and effective evaluation of potential energy imbalances."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While interpretations can vary, a predominantly red aura is often associated with physical vitality, grounding, and passion. However, the intensity and shade of red can provide further nuance."

            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah, 45, with chronic headaches', what assessment tool proved MOST effective in identifying the root cause of her energy imbalance?",
            "options": ["Aura photography.", "Advanced palpation techniques.", "Pendulum dowsing.", "Client history and intuitive scanning combined."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the importance of integrating client history with intuitive scanning. Sarah's emotional stressors, combined with the practitioner's intuition, revealed a connection between her headaches and unresolved emotional issues."

            "options": ["Guaranteeing specific outcomes based on assessment findings.", "Presenting assessment findings as definitive medical diagnoses.", "Emphasizing that Reiki is a complementary therapy and assessment findings are for energetic guidance only.", "Using assessment tools to pressure clients into purchasing additional services."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires clear communication that Reiki is complementary, and assessment findings should guide energetic balancing, not replace medical advice. Guaranteeing results or diagnosing medical conditions are unethical and potentially harmful."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A practitioner is using dowsing rods and consistently gets conflicting readings. What is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Trust the first reading obtained and disregard the others.", "Assume the dowsing rods are faulty and discontinue use.", "Re-evaluate their technique, grounding, and mental clarity before continuing.", "Average the readings to find a 'middle ground' interpretation."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Conflicting readings often indicate a lack of clarity or grounding on the practitioner's part. Re-evaluating technique and mental state is crucial for accurate assessment."
