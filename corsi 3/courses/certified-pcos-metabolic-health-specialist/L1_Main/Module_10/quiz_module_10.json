            "question": "Which of the following supplements has shown the MOST promising results in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels in women with PCOS, according to recent meta-analyses?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Myo-inositol", "N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol has consistently demonstrated significant benefits in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels in women with PCOS, supported by multiple meta-analyses. For example, a 2016 meta-analysis in the International Journal of Endocrinology found that myo-inositol significantly improved insulin resistance and ovulation rates."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS presents with an 'Adrenal' phenotype (elevated DHEAS, anxiety, and sleep disturbances). Which exercise strategy would be MOST appropriate to initially prioritize?",
            "options": ["High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) 3 times per week", "Long-duration, moderate-intensity cardio daily", "Yoga and mindfulness practices combined with light walking", "Heavy resistance training 4 times per week"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For the 'Adrenal' phenotype, prioritizing stress reduction is crucial. Yoga and mindfulness, combined with light walking, can help regulate cortisol levels and improve overall well-being before introducing more intense exercise. HIIT could further dysregulate cortisol."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "When interpreting advanced lab testing for PCOS, a Ferritin level of 15 ng/mL in a patient with heavy menstrual bleeding should prompt further investigation for:",
            "options": ["Insulin resistance", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Hyperandrogenism", "Thyroid dysfunction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Ferritin level of 15 ng/mL is indicative of iron deficiency, especially in the context of heavy menstrual bleeding. Further investigation should focus on confirming iron deficiency anemia and identifying the cause of blood loss. Levels below 30 ng/mL are often considered deficient."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Which macronutrient manipulation strategy is MOST likely to benefit a client with PCOS exhibiting severe insulin resistance and consistently elevated postprandial glucose levels?",
            "options": ["Increasing carbohydrate intake to 50% of total calories", "Implementing intermittent fasting with a 16/8 eating window", "Adopting a ketogenic diet with very low carbohydrate intake", "Focusing on evenly distributing protein intake throughout the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ketogenic diet, with its very low carbohydrate intake, can be highly effective in reducing postprandial glucose spikes and improving insulin sensitivity in individuals with severe insulin resistance. However, it requires careful monitoring and may not be suitable for everyone."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Beyond relaxation techniques, which advanced stress management strategy focuses on identifying and modifying negative thought patterns that contribute to chronic stress in PCOS?",
            "options": ["Progressive Muscle Relaxation", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)", "Deep Breathing Exercises", "Acupuncture"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured approach that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to stress and anxiety. This is particularly relevant in PCOS, where stress can exacerbate hormonal imbalances."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to the latest research, which of the following gut microbiome profiles is MOST commonly associated with increased risk of PCOS and metabolic dysfunction?",
            "options": ["High microbial diversity with abundant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers", "Increased levels of Akkermansia muciniphila", "Decreased microbial diversity with an overabundance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria", "Predominance of Bifidobacteria species"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Decreased microbial diversity and an overabundance of LPS-producing bacteria are frequently observed in individuals with PCOS. LPS can trigger inflammation and insulin resistance, contributing to the pathogenesis of the condition. Studies have shown a correlation between gut dysbiosis and PCOS severity."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "A couple is undergoing IVF treatment. The female partner has PCOS and a history of recurrent miscarriages. Which of the following interventions is MOST likely to improve pregnancy outcomes?",
            "options": ["Administering high doses of folic acid only", "Using metformin throughout the first trimester", "Supplementing with CoQ10 and myo-inositol prior to and during IVF", "Increasing the dosage of gonadotropins during ovarian stimulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supplementing with CoQ10 and myo-inositol has shown promise in improving egg quality and reducing the risk of miscarriage in women with PCOS undergoing IVF. These supplements support mitochondrial function and oocyte maturation. Metformin use during pregnancy is controversial and should be carefully considered."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "In a case study involving a client with Lean PCOS, hirsutism, and normal BMI, which dietary approach proved MOST effective in reducing androgen levels and improving skin conditions, according to the THRIVE framework?",
            "options": ["A low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet", "A vegan diet rich in phytoestrogens", "A moderate-protein, moderate-fat diet with a focus on whole foods and balanced blood sugar", "A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet with minimal processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In Lean PCOS, a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet often demonstrates effectiveness because it helps manage insulin levels and can reduce androgen production. The focus on whole, unprocessed foods is key to reducing inflammation and supporting overall hormonal balance. The THRIVE framework emphasizes individualization, but this approach is often a good starting point for Lean PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced lab tests provides the MOST comprehensive assessment of adrenal function and stress hormone metabolism beyond a standard cortisol test?",
            "options": ["Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)", "24-hour Urinary Cortisol and Cortisone Metabolites", "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 24-hour urinary cortisol and cortisone metabolites test offers a more complete picture of adrenal function by measuring the total production and metabolism of cortisol over a full day, rather than a single point-in-time measurement like a serum cortisol test. This test can reveal patterns of cortisol dysregulation not apparent in standard tests."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing persistent bloating and digestive discomfort despite following a generally healthy diet. Advanced gut testing reveals elevated levels of methane-producing archaea. Which intervention is MOST likely to alleviate these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus strains", "A low-FODMAP diet combined with specific herbal antimicrobials targeting methane production", "Increasing fiber intake to promote bowel regularity", "Gluten-free diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated methane-producing archaea often indicate small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). A low-FODMAP diet can reduce substrate availability for these organisms, while specific herbal antimicrobials (e.g., allicin, berberine) can help reduce their numbers. This combined approach is often more effective than probiotics alone."
