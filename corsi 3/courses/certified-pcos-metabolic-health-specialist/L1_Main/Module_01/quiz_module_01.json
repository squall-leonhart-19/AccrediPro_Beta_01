        {
            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in a targeted assessment for a client presenting with suspected PCOS?",
            "options": ["Hormonal blood panel", "Comprehensive symptom evaluation", "Dietary recall analysis", "Exercise stress test"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive symptom evaluation provides a foundation for further targeted testing. As discussed in Lesson 2, understanding the client's specific symptoms guides the selection of appropriate metabolic and hormonal assessments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client's metabolic marker analysis reveals elevated fasting insulin (15 μIU/mL; reference range: 2.6-24.9 μIU/mL) and a normal HbA1c (5.4%). What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["Well-controlled blood sugar", "Insulin resistance", "Type 2 Diabetes", "Normal metabolic function"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated fasting insulin, even with a normal HbA1c, is a strong indicator of insulin resistance, a key feature of PCOS. As highlighted in Lesson 3, this early sign can precede overt diabetes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to research presented in Lesson 4, what percentage of women with PCOS report sleep disturbances?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that 70-80% of women with PCOS report sleep disturbances, often linked to insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances. Addressing sleep quality is crucial for overall metabolic health."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which of the following psychological assessments is MOST appropriate for identifying potential anxiety and depression in a client with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Rorschach test", "Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)", "Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)", "Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) are validated screening tools specifically designed to assess the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms. Lesson 5 emphasizes the importance of using standardized tools."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A client's hormonal profile reveals elevated DHEA-S levels. This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Ovarian insufficiency", "Adrenal androgen excess", "Estrogen dominance", "Thyroid dysfunction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated DHEA-S typically points to adrenal androgen excess, a common hormonal imbalance in PCOS. Lesson 6 details the interpretation of various hormonal markers."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In the context of a client interview, what does 'active listening' primarily involve?",
            "options": ["Dominating the conversation to gather information quickly", "Providing immediate solutions to the client's problems", "Paying close attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues to understand the client's perspective", "Focusing solely on the client's medical history"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Active listening, as discussed in Lesson 7, involves fully engaging with the client, attending to their verbal and nonverbal communication, and demonstrating empathy to build rapport and gather accurate information."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 28, presents with irregular periods, hirsutism, and acne. Her initial assessment reveals insulin resistance and elevated androgens. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate SMART goal for Sarah regarding her diet?",
            "options": ["Lose 20 pounds in one month", "Eliminate all carbohydrates from her diet", "Reduce processed sugar intake to no more than 20 grams per day for 4 weeks", "Start a ketogenic diet immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Reducing processed sugar intake to a specific amount within a defined timeframe aligns with these principles and is a realistic initial step. Lesson 8 emphasizes setting achievable goals."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent feelings of hopelessness and suicidal ideation are serious indicators of a mental health crisis and warrant immediate referral to a qualified mental health professional. Lesson 5 stresses the importance of recognizing when a referral is necessary."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client reports following a low-calorie diet (1200 calories/day) and engaging in intense cardio workouts 7 days a week to manage her PCOS symptoms. What potential negative consequence should you assess for?",
            "options": ["Improved insulin sensitivity", "Reduced androgen levels", "Increased metabolic rate", "Adrenal fatigue and hormonal dysregulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Excessive calorie restriction and intense exercise can lead to adrenal fatigue and hormonal dysregulation, potentially exacerbating PCOS symptoms. Lesson 4 highlights the importance of balanced lifestyle interventions."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "You are synthesizing assessment data for a new client. She has elevated androgens, insulin resistance, and reports significant stress. Which of the following would be the MOST comprehensive initial intervention strategy?",
            "options": ["Prescription medication for androgen suppression only", "Strict low-carbohydrate diet", "Stress management techniques, dietary modifications to improve insulin sensitivity, and moderate exercise", "Intense high-intensity interval training (HIIT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive approach addressing multiple facets of PCOS, including stress management, insulin sensitivity, and moderate exercise, is more effective than focusing on a single symptom or intervention. This integrated approach aligns with the principles discussed in Lesson 8."
