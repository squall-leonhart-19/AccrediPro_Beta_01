        {
            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which of the following macronutrient ratios is generally MOST recommended as a starting point for women with PCOS focusing on insulin resistance, as discussed in the Personalized Meal Plans lesson?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat, moderate-protein", "Moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-fat, moderate-protein", "Low-carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate-protein", "High-fat, low-protein, low-carbohydrate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-carbohydrate, high-fat, moderate-protein approach can be effective for managing insulin resistance, a key concern in PCOS. While individual needs vary, this ratio often yields positive results initially."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the Exercise as Medicine lesson, what type of exercise has been shown to be particularly effective in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Steady-state cardio", "Yoga and Pilates", "Resistance training"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Resistance training builds muscle mass, which improves insulin sensitivity and helps regulate androgen levels. A 2021 study published in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* found resistance training to be more effective than cardio alone for improving metabolic and hormonal profiles in PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which stress management technique, discussed in the Hormonal Harmony lesson, involves focusing on the present moment and accepting thoughts and feelings without judgment?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)", "Mindfulness meditation", "Deep breathing exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation helps reduce cortisol levels and improve emotional regulation, which are crucial for managing the stress response in PCOS. Studies show that regular mindfulness practice can significantly lower anxiety and depression symptoms."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "What is the recommended sleep duration for most adults with PCOS, as emphasized in the Sleep Optimization lesson, to support metabolic health and hormonal balance?",
            "options": ["Less than 6 hours", "6-7 hours", "7-9 hours", "9-10 hours"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "7-9 hours of sleep is generally recommended to optimize metabolic function and hormonal regulation. Insufficient sleep can exacerbate insulin resistance and increase cortisol levels, negatively impacting PCOS symptoms."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements, discussed in the Supplementation Strategies lesson, has strong evidence for improving insulin sensitivity and ovarian function in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Inositol", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inositol, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, regulate menstrual cycles, and enhance fertility in women with PCOS. A 2018 meta-analysis in the *International Journal of Endocrinology* supports these findings."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BPA is an endocrine disruptor that can interfere with hormone function and exacerbate PCOS symptoms. Minimizing exposure to BPA through careful selection of food and beverage containers is crucial."

Based on the THRIVE framework, what is the MOST important initial recommendation from the 'H' (Holistic Harmonization) to address her primary concern?",
            "options": ["Recommend a strict keto diet immediately.", "Introduce daily mindfulness meditation and deep breathing exercises.", "Suggest a high-intensity workout routine.", "Prescribe a combination of supplements without dietary changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
