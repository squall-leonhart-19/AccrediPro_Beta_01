            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements has demonstrated the MOST significant improvement in insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, based on meta-analysis data presented in the module?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)", "Inositol (specifically myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol combination)", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show that inositol, particularly a combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, has the strongest evidence for improving insulin sensitivity in PCOS compared to other supplements. Studies suggest the 40:1 ratio mimics the physiological ratio found in plasma."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS presents with symptoms of acne, hirsutism, and irregular cycles. Her blood work reveals elevated DHEAS levels. Which dietary approach is MOST likely to be beneficial in managing her androgen excess?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "Low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet", "High-protein, ketogenic diet", "Vegan diet with soy-based protein"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet can help regulate insulin levels, which in turn can reduce androgen production. Elevated DHEAS suggests adrenal androgen excess, which is often exacerbated by insulin resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the module, what type of exercise is MOST effective for improving both insulin sensitivity and reducing visceral fat in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Steady-state cardio", "Yoga and Pilates", "Resistance training"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While all exercise is beneficial, HIIT has been shown to be particularly effective at improving insulin sensitivity and reducing visceral fat in PCOS due to its impact on glucose metabolism and hormonal response. Studies suggest even short bursts of HIIT can yield significant results."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing significant stress due to work and family responsibilities. She also has PCOS and struggles with weight management. Which stress management technique would be MOST appropriate to recommend as a starting point?",
            "options": ["Advanced biofeedback training", "Mindfulness meditation", "Extreme sports for stress release", "Prolonged social isolation for relaxation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation is a readily accessible and evidence-based technique for managing stress. It can help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is often dysregulated in PCOS, impacting weight and hormonal balance. Biofeedback training can be effective but requires more specialized training."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "What is the recommended sleep duration for most adults with PCOS to optimize hormonal balance and metabolic health, according to the module?",
            "options": ["Less than 6 hours", "6-7 hours", "7-9 hours", "More than 9 hours"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes the importance of 7-9 hours of sleep for optimal hormonal balance and metabolic health. Insufficient sleep can exacerbate insulin resistance and androgen excess in PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a common mechanism by which stress exacerbates PCOS symptoms?",
            "options": ["Increased cortisol production", "Suppression of the HPA axis", "Increased insulin resistance", "Dysregulation of the gut microbiome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress typically leads to activation, not suppression, of the HPA axis. Increased cortisol, insulin resistance, and gut microbiome dysregulation are all common mechanisms by which stress worsens PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A 28-year-old client with PCOS is trying to conceive naturally. Her cycles are irregular, and ovulation is infrequent. Which supplement, in addition to prenatal vitamins, might be MOST beneficial to support ovulation?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "Vitamin C", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 has shown promise in improving egg quality and ovulation in women with PCOS. While other supplements have general health benefits, CoQ10 directly supports mitochondrial function in the ovaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "What long-term health risk is significantly elevated in women with PCOS compared to the general population, even after adjusting for BMI?",
            "options": ["Osteoporosis", "Alzheimer's disease", "Cardiovascular disease", "Rheumatoid arthritis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cardiovascular disease risk is significantly elevated in women with PCOS, independent of BMI. This is due to factors like insulin resistance, inflammation, and dyslipidemia, which are common in PCOS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Based on the module's discussion of PCOS subtypes, which dietary approach might be MOST appropriate for a client with 'Inflammatory PCOS' characterized by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)?",
            "options": ["High-dairy diet to increase calcium intake", "Gluten-free and dairy-free diet with emphasis on anti-inflammatory foods", "Strict ketogenic diet with high saturated fat intake", "High-sugar diet to support energy levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An anti-inflammatory diet, often gluten-free and dairy-free, is crucial for managing 'Inflammatory PCOS'. This approach aims to reduce systemic inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity. High saturated fat and sugar intake would likely exacerbate inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client with PCOS has been consistently following a healthy diet and exercise plan for six months but is still struggling with significant hirsutism. What advanced strategy, discussed in the module, might be considered NEXT, in consultation with her physician?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating carbohydrates from her diet", "Increasing exercise to 2 hours per day", "Pharmacological interventions targeting androgen production or action", "Radically changing her sleep schedule"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If lifestyle modifications are insufficient, pharmacological interventions such as anti-androgen medications (e.g., spironolactone, finasteride) may be necessary to manage hirsutism. These should always be prescribed and monitored by a physician."
