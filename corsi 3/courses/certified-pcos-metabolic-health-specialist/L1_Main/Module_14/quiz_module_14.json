        {
            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following assessment techniques is MOST useful for differentiating between PCOS phenotypes, particularly when assessing for non-classic presentations?",
            "options": ["Basal body temperature charting", "Advanced lipid panel including LDL particle size and number", "Comprehensive urinary hormone testing including cortisol metabolites", "Semen analysis for male partners"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced lipid panels, particularly LDL particle size and number, are helpful in assessing metabolic health and identifying subtle indicators of insulin resistance, a key differentiator in PCOS phenotypes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS and confirmed insulin resistance has not responded adequately to metformin. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate to consider NEXT, based on evidence-based guidelines?",
            "options": ["Adding a thiazolidinedione (TZD) such as pioglitazone", "Initiating a ketogenic diet with less than 20g of carbohydrates per day", "Prescribing a GLP-1 receptor agonist such as liraglutide", "Recommending a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) for rapid weight loss"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss in PCOS, often showing better results than metformin alone in some individuals. TZDs have potential side effects, and VLCDs and ketogenic diets may not be sustainable or appropriate for all individuals."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate method for assessing androgen excess in a woman with PCOS, particularly when considering non-classical presentations?",
            "options": ["Total testosterone level", "Free androgen index (FAI)", "Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) level", "Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for measuring androgens"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "LC-MS/MS provides the most accurate and sensitive measurement of androgens, including testosterone and DHT, allowing for the detection of subtle androgen imbalances that may be missed by less sensitive methods."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client with PCOS presents with elevated hs-CRP and interleukin-6 levels. Which of the following dietary interventions is MOST likely to address the underlying inflammatory processes?",
            "options": ["A diet high in processed foods and refined sugars", "A diet rich in omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils", "A Mediterranean-style diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids", "A low-fat diet with minimal emphasis on antioxidant-rich foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Mediterranean-style diet is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce systemic inflammation in PCOS. Processed foods and omega-6 fatty acids can exacerbate inflammation."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following interventions has demonstrated the GREATEST efficacy in improving ovulation rates and pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing fertility treatment?",
            "options": ["Clomiphene citrate alone", "Metformin alone", "Letrozole combined with lifestyle modifications", "In vitro fertilization (IVF) without any prior interventions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Letrozole, particularly when combined with lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and exercise, has shown superior ovulation and pregnancy rates compared to clomiphene citrate in women with PCOS. IVF is more invasive and costly and should be considered after less invasive options have been explored."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A 28-year-old client with PCOS reports experiencing significant anxiety and depressive symptoms. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate as an INITIAL step, considering the interconnectedness of PCOS and mental health?",
            "options": ["Prescription of an SSRI antidepressant", "Referral to a psychiatrist for immediate medication management", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and lifestyle modifications", "Recommending St. John's Wort without medical supervision"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CBT and lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and stress management techniques, are evidence-based interventions for anxiety and depression and should be considered as initial steps, especially given the potential impact of PCOS on mental health. Medication may be necessary but should be considered in conjunction with therapy and lifestyle changes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST significant long-term health risk associated with PCOS that requires proactive management and prevention strategies?",
            "options": ["Increased risk of acne", "Increased risk of hirsutism", "Increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease", "Increased risk of irregular menstrual cycles"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "PCOS significantly increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease due to underlying insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Proactive management and prevention strategies are crucial to mitigate these risks."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the THRIVE Framework™, which element focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of PCOS symptoms, rather than just managing the symptoms themselves?",
            "options": ["Treat", "Heal", "Restore", "Investigate"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Within the THRIVE Framework™, the 'Investigate' element is dedicated to uncovering the underlying root causes and contributing factors to the individual's PCOS presentation, allowing for a more targeted and effective treatment approach."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "In a case study involving a client with lean PCOS and persistent fatigue, which of the following investigative approaches would be MOST relevant to consider?",
            "options": ["Assessing for iron deficiency anemia and thyroid dysfunction", "Measuring serum testosterone levels", "Evaluating fasting insulin levels", "Performing an oral glucose tolerance test"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lean PCOS can often be associated with underlying nutrient deficiencies (like iron) and thyroid issues, which can contribute to fatigue. These should be investigated even if the client is not overweight or insulin resistant."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A client with PCOS has been consistently implementing lifestyle modifications, yet her menstrual cycles remain irregular. Which hormonal imbalance is MOST likely contributing to this issue, requiring further investigation and targeted intervention?",
            "options": ["Elevated prolactin levels", "Low estrogen levels", "Elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels", "Low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated LH levels, particularly with a high LH:FSH ratio, are commonly seen in PCOS and contribute to irregular ovulation and menstrual cycles. This imbalance often requires specific interventions to regulate hormonal signaling."
