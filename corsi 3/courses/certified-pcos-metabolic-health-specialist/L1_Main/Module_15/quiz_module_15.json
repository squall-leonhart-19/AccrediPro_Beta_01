            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding inositol supplementation in PCOS, based on the advanced supplementation strategies discussed?",
            "options": ["Myo-inositol is effective for all women with PCOS regardless of phenotype.", "D-chiro-inositol is generally superior to myo-inositol for improving insulin sensitivity.", "A combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, in a 40:1 ratio, has shown promise in improving both metabolic and reproductive parameters.", "Inositol supplementation is only effective when combined with metformin."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While both myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol have benefits, the 40:1 ratio of myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol mimics the physiological ratio in plasma and has demonstrated improved outcomes in several studies, particularly regarding ovarian function and insulin sensitivity in PCOS."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS, Sarah, presents with persistent anovulation despite lifestyle modifications and inositol supplementation. Her lab results show elevated androgens and normal insulin sensitivity. Which of the following advanced exercise prescriptions is MOST appropriate to consider FIRST?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 5 days a week.", "Long-duration, moderate-intensity cardio.", "A combination of resistance training focusing on compound movements and moderate-intensity cardio, with careful monitoring of stress response.", "Pilates and yoga only."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's elevated androgens and normal insulin sensitivity, prioritizing resistance training to improve muscle mass and metabolic rate, combined with moderate-intensity cardio, can be beneficial. However, monitoring her stress response (cortisol levels, perceived stress) is crucial, as excessive exercise can exacerbate androgen levels in some women with PCOS."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "In the context of motivational interviewing, which of the following responses BEST exemplifies the principle of 'expressing empathy' when a client states, 'I know I need to change my diet, but it's just so hard'?",
            "options": ["'I understand it's difficult, but you need to be more disciplined.'", "'Many people find dietary changes challenging. What specifically feels hard about it for you?'", "'It's not that hard if you just follow the meal plan.'", "'You're not alone. Everyone struggles with diet changes.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Expressing empathy involves understanding and reflecting the client's feelings without judgment. Option B acknowledges the difficulty and invites the client to elaborate, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Based on the advanced dietary strategies discussed, which macronutrient ratio is MOST likely to be beneficial for a client with lean PCOS, insulin resistance, and a history of disordered eating?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat, moderate-protein.", "Ketogenic diet (very low-carbohydrate, high-fat).", "Moderate-carbohydrate, moderate-fat, moderate-protein, emphasizing whole, unprocessed foods and mindful eating.", "High-protein, low-carbohydrate, low-fat."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For lean PCOS with insulin resistance and a history of disordered eating, a balanced approach emphasizing whole, unprocessed foods and mindful eating is generally preferred. Extreme macronutrient ratios (e.g., ketogenic) may be restrictive and trigger disordered eating patterns. A moderate approach allows for flexibility and sustainability while addressing insulin resistance."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which of the following mind-body techniques has the STRONGEST evidence base for reducing cortisol levels and improving psychological well-being in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Guided meditation.", "Progressive muscle relaxation.", "Yoga.", "All of the above have similar strong evidence."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all listed techniques can be beneficial, studies show that guided meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and yoga have all demonstrated significant reductions in cortisol levels and improvements in psychological well-being in women with PCOS when practiced regularly. The key is finding a technique the client enjoys and can adhere to."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "A client's lab results show a high-normal DHEAS level (400 mcg/dL, reference range 85-425 mcg/dL) despite normal testosterone levels. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Prescription medication to lower androgens.", "Further investigation to rule out non-classical adrenal hyperplasia or other adrenal disorders.", "Supplementation with saw palmetto.", "No action is needed as testosterone is normal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated DHEAS, even with normal testosterone, warrants further investigation to rule out underlying adrenal issues like non-classical adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) or other adrenal disorders. While lifestyle modifications and supplements may eventually be helpful, identifying the root cause is crucial first."

            "question": "According to research discussed in the sleep optimization lesson, what percentage of women with PCOS experience sleep disturbances?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 50-60% of women with PCOS report experiencing sleep disturbances, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome. Addressing sleep is therefore a critical component of PCOS management."

            "question": "Which of the following marketing strategies is MOST effective for attracting and retaining clients in a specialized PCOS practice?",
            "options": ["Running generic weight loss ads on social media.", "Offering discounted services to everyone who inquires.", "Creating valuable, PCOS-specific content (blog posts, webinars, social media content) that addresses common concerns and establishes expertise.", "Focusing solely on paid advertising."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating valuable, PCOS-specific content establishes you as an expert, builds trust with potential clients, and attracts individuals actively seeking solutions for their specific needs. This approach is more effective than generic marketing or relying solely on discounts or paid advertising."

            "question": "Client Maria, 28, presents with PCOS, infertility, and a BMI of 35. Her labs show elevated fasting insulin and HbA1c. She is hesitant to start medication. What is the MOST appropriate initial approach?",
            "options": ["Immediately prescribe Metformin.", "Recommend bariatric surgery.", "Implement intensive lifestyle interventions focusing on diet, exercise, and stress management, while closely monitoring lab values and symptoms.", "Tell her to come back when she's ready for medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Maria's hesitancy towards medication, initiating intensive lifestyle interventions is the most appropriate first step. This involves a comprehensive approach addressing diet, exercise, and stress management, while closely monitoring her lab values and symptoms to assess progress and determine if further interventions, such as medication, become necessary."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing significant bloating and digestive discomfort after consuming certain vegetables. Which advanced dietary strategy is MOST relevant to explore in this situation?",
            "options": ["Recommending a low-FODMAP diet to identify potential trigger foods.", "Suggesting a juice cleanse.", "Prescribing digestive enzymes without further investigation.", "Ignoring the symptoms as unrelated to PCOS."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bloating and digestive discomfort can be related to food sensitivities or intolerances. A low-FODMAP diet is a structured approach to identify potential trigger foods that contribute to these symptoms, allowing for a more personalized dietary plan."
