            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increasing monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids can help improve lipid profiles while maintaining the benefits of a ketogenic diet. A case study in the lesson highlighted this improvement."

            "options": ["Long-distance running", "High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)", "Yoga", "Pilates"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIIT has been shown in multiple studies (e.g., reviewed in the lesson) to be highly effective for improving insulin sensitivity due to its impact on glucose metabolism and muscle glucose uptake."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A client reports chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels. Which stress management technique, supported by research, would be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["Watching television", "Mindfulness meditation", "Consuming sugary drinks", "Avoiding social interaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation has been shown in studies to reduce cortisol levels and improve stress resilience, as discussed in the stress management section."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which supplement is MOST likely to improve egg quality in women with PCOS undergoing fertility treatments?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)", "Calcium", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is an antioxidant that supports mitochondrial function, which is crucial for egg quality. Studies have shown its potential benefits in improving fertility outcomes for women with PCOS."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY mechanism by which optimizing sleep improves PCOS symptoms?",
            "options": ["Directly lowers testosterone levels", "Regulates cortisol and improves insulin sensitivity", "Increases appetite", "Decreases muscle mass"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep optimization helps regulate the HPA axis, reducing cortisol levels and improving insulin sensitivity, which are key factors in managing PCOS."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the THRIVE Framework™, 'I' stands for Inflammation, addressing the chronic inflammatory state often associated with PCOS."

            "question": "A pregnant client with PCOS is at increased risk for which of the following complications?",
            "options": ["Decreased risk of gestational diabetes", "Increased risk of preeclampsia", "Decreased risk of preterm birth", "Lower risk of miscarriage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Women with PCOS have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia during pregnancy due to underlying metabolic and vascular dysfunction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding the long-term health risks associated with PCOS?",
            "options": ["PCOS only affects reproductive health", "Women with PCOS have a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease", "PCOS increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease", "PCOS has no impact on mental health"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PCOS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease due to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, as highlighted in longitudinal studies discussed in the module."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 32, presents with hirsutism, irregular cycles, and acanthosis nigricans. Her OGTT reveals elevated insulin levels. Based on this information, which intervention should be prioritized?",
            "options": ["Iron supplementation", "Stress reduction techniques and a low glycemic index diet", "Hormone replacement therapy", "Increased saturated fat intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's symptoms and OGTT results indicate insulin resistance. Prioritizing stress reduction and a low glycemic index diet will help improve insulin sensitivity and address the underlying metabolic dysfunction driving her symptoms. This approach aligns with the THRIVE framework's emphasis on addressing root causes."
