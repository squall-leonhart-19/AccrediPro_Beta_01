            "question": "Which of the following sleep interventions has demonstrated the MOST significant improvement in sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Consistent bedtime routine and sleep hygiene education alone", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)", "Melatonin supplementation at 3mg daily", "Magnesium supplementation at 400mg daily"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all options can contribute to improved sleep, CBT-I has shown the most robust and sustained improvements in sleep quality based on multiple studies and meta-analyses reviewed in the sleep lesson. CBT-I directly addresses the underlying cognitive and behavioral factors contributing to insomnia."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS, Sarah, has been taking metformin for insulin resistance with limited success. Her HbA1c remains at 6.2%. Which of the following interventions would be the MOST appropriate NEXT step, considering approaches discussed beyond metformin?",
            "options": ["Increase metformin dosage to the maximum tolerated dose.", "Add a thiazolidinedione (TZD) like pioglitazone.", "Incorporate a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program and inositol supplementation.", "Prescribe a GLP-1 receptor agonist like semaglutide."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's HbA1c remains elevated despite metformin, a multi-faceted approach addressing lifestyle and using inositols is warranted. Studies indicate HIIT and inositol can significantly improve insulin sensitivity. While GLP-1 agonists are effective, lifestyle and inositols should be prioritized first. Increasing metformin or adding a TZD carries higher risks of side effects."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the exercise prescription lesson, which type of exercise is MOST effective at reducing visceral fat in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Low-intensity steady-state cardio (LISS)", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Resistance training alone", "Yoga and Pilates"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "HIIT has been shown to be more effective than LISS for reducing visceral fat in women with PCOS due to its impact on hormonal responses and energy expenditure. A 2017 study in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* supports this finding."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "A client presents with hirsutism and elevated DHEA-S levels. Which of the following supplements is LEAST likely to be effective in directly managing androgen excess, based on current evidence?",
            "options": ["Spearmint tea", "Saw palmetto", "N-acetylcysteine (NAC)", "Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While Vitamin D is important for overall health and may indirectly influence hormonal balance, it does not have a direct, well-established mechanism for reducing androgen production or activity. Spearmint, saw palmetto, and NAC have shown some evidence of androgen-lowering effects."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which of the following interventions has demonstrated the HIGHEST success rate in improving ovulation rates in women with PCOS undergoing fertility treatment, when combined with standard protocols like clomiphene citrate?",
            "options": ["Acupuncture", "Myo-inositol supplementation", "D-chiro-inositol supplementation", "A low-glycemic index diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol supplementation, particularly in combination with D-chiro-inositol, has consistently shown higher ovulation rates and improved oocyte quality in women with PCOS undergoing fertility treatments, compared to other options. Multiple meta-analyses support this finding."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which of the following gut bacteria imbalances is MOST commonly associated with increased androgen levels and insulin resistance in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Increased Bifidobacteria", "Decreased Firmicutes", "Increased LPS-producing bacteria", "Increased Akkermansia muciniphila"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increased levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria in the gut can lead to increased inflammation and insulin resistance, which are both linked to higher androgen levels in PCOS. This is due to the translocation of LPS into the bloodstream, triggering an immune response."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "A client with PCOS reports experiencing significant anxiety and depressive symptoms. Besides referral to a mental health professional, which of the following dietary interventions might be MOST helpful in supporting their emotional well-being?",
            "options": ["A ketogenic diet", "A high-protein diet", "An anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids", "A completely gluten-free diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "An anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation in the brain and support neurotransmitter function, which can improve mood and reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms. Omega-3s have been shown to have mood-stabilizing effects."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "Based on personalized supplementation strategies, which of the following tests would be MOST helpful in determining the need for Vitamin D supplementation in a client with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)", "25-hydroxy Vitamin D level", "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 25-hydroxy Vitamin D level is the gold standard for assessing Vitamin D status. It directly measures the amount of Vitamin D in the blood and helps determine if supplementation is needed."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 28-year-old client, Maria, with PCOS is experiencing significant sleep disturbances, insulin resistance, and mood fluctuations. Her gut microbiome analysis reveals low microbial diversity and increased levels of inflammatory bacteria. Which integrative approach would address ALL these interconnected issues most effectively?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a strong antibiotic to eradicate the inflammatory bacteria.", "Recommending a high-dose probiotic supplement alone.", "Implementing a comprehensive gut health protocol including dietary changes, prebiotics, probiotics, and stress management techniques.", "Focusing solely on sleep hygiene and CBT-I."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive gut health protocol that includes dietary changes, prebiotics, probiotics, and stress management techniques addresses the gut-brain axis, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances simultaneously, leading to improvements in sleep, insulin resistance, and mood. Addressing the gut is key in this scenario."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "A client with PCOS is considering taking berberine to help manage insulin resistance. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the use of berberine?",
            "options": ["Berberine is safe for all individuals and does not interact with any medications.", "Berberine's effectiveness is similar to that of metformin, but it has a different mechanism of action and potential side effects.", "Berberine is only effective when combined with a ketogenic diet.", "Berberine is a synthetic drug with no natural sources."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Berberine has been shown to be as effective as metformin in some studies, with a different mechanism of action. While generally safe, it can interact with certain medications and may cause gastrointestinal side effects in some individuals. It is a natural compound found in several plants."
