            "question": "Which macronutrient ratio has demonstrated the most consistent benefit for improving insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, according to recent research?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat", "Low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein, high-fat", "Balanced carbohydrate, protein, and fat", "High-protein, low-carbohydrate, moderate-fat"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While individual needs vary, a lower carbohydrate intake, combined with moderate protein and higher healthy fat intake, has shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity, a key factor in PCOS management. This approach helps to stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS, Sarah, reports difficulty adhering to a regular exercise routine. She enjoys walking but finds gym workouts intimidating. What is the MOST appropriate initial exercise prescription for Sarah?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) 3 times per week", "Daily 60-minute brisk walks", "Strength training focusing on compound exercises 4 times per week", "Yoga and Pilates 5 times per week"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with a sustainable activity like daily brisk walking is crucial for adherence. It provides cardiovascular benefits and can improve insulin sensitivity without overwhelming the client. HIIT and intense strength training may be introduced gradually as Sarah's fitness level and confidence increase."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which supplement has demonstrated the strongest evidence for improving egg quality and ovulation rates in women with PCOS undergoing fertility treatment?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Inositol", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inositol, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, has shown significant benefits in improving egg quality, ovulation rates, and insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, especially those undergoing fertility treatment. Studies suggest a ratio of 40:1 of myo-inositol to D-chiro-inositol may be optimal."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "A client with PCOS reports chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels. Which stress management technique would be MOST effective as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Vigorous aerobic exercise", "Mindfulness meditation", "Intermittent fasting", "High-intensity weightlifting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation is a gentle and accessible technique that can help reduce cortisol levels and improve stress resilience. Vigorous exercise and intermittent fasting can potentially exacerbate stress in some individuals, especially initially. Weightlifting is good, but not the MOST effective for initial stress reduction."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "According to sleep studies, what is the MINIMUM recommended duration of sleep per night for women with PCOS to support metabolic health and hormonal balance?",
            "options": ["5 hours", "6 hours", "7 hours", "8 hours"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aiming for at least 7 hours of quality sleep per night is crucial for women with PCOS. Sleep deprivation can worsen insulin resistance, increase cortisol levels, and disrupt hormonal balance, negatively impacting metabolic health."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Which behavioral modification technique is MOST effective for promoting long-term adherence to dietary changes in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Setting unrealistic goals for rapid weight loss", "Eliminating all favorite foods from the diet", "Focusing on small, incremental changes and celebrating successes", "Using a strict, inflexible meal plan"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Focusing on small, incremental changes and celebrating successes is a key principle of behavioral modification. This approach makes dietary changes more manageable and sustainable, increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence and positive outcomes. Setting unrealistic goals or using strict meal plans often leads to discouragement and relapse."

        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which gut health intervention is MOST likely to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation in women with PCOS, based on current research?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet", "Consuming a diet rich in prebiotic and probiotic foods", "Taking broad-spectrum antibiotics", "Following a strict ketogenic diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in prebiotic and probiotic foods can promote a healthy gut microbiome, which has been linked to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation in PCOS. Prebiotics feed beneficial gut bacteria, while probiotics introduce beneficial bacteria directly. Antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome, and restrictive diets may not be sustainable or beneficial for all individuals."

            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A 28-year-old client with PCOS, Maria, presents with insulin resistance, irregular periods, and anxiety. Which of the following integrated interventions would be the MOST appropriate initial approach?",
            "options": ["Prescription medication for anxiety", "Strict ketogenic diet and intense exercise", "Focus on stress management, sleep optimization, and a balanced diet with regular exercise", "Immediate fertility treatments"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying issues of stress, sleep, and diet is crucial for managing Maria's PCOS symptoms. A balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and sleep optimization can improve insulin resistance, regulate periods, and reduce anxiety. Prescription medication and fertility treatments may be considered later if needed, but lifestyle interventions should be prioritized initially."

        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of studies on PCOS found that combining which two interventions yielded the most significant improvements in metabolic and reproductive outcomes?",
            "options": ["Medication and surgery", "Diet and exercise", "Supplements and acupuncture", "Stress management and sleep hygiene"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Numerous studies and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that the combination of dietary modifications and regular exercise yields the most significant improvements in metabolic and reproductive outcomes for women with PCOS. These interventions address insulin resistance, weight management, and hormonal balance."

        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "When creating a personalized care plan for a client with PCOS, what is the MOST important factor to consider?",
            "options": ["Following a standardized protocol for all PCOS clients", "Focusing solely on weight loss", "Individualizing the plan based on the client's specific symptoms, goals, and preferences", "Prioritizing the latest fad diets"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individualizing the care plan is paramount for successful PCOS management. Each client presents with a unique combination of symptoms, goals, and preferences. A personalized approach ensures that the interventions are tailored to meet the client's specific needs and increase the likelihood of adherence and positive outcomes. Standardized protocols and focusing solely on weight loss may not address the underlying issues or be sustainable for all individuals."
