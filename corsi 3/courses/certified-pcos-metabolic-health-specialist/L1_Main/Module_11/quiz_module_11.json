        "Implementing a ketogenic diet immediately.",
        "Recommending intermittent fasting with a 16-hour fasting window.",
        "Assessing for hidden sugars and processed foods in their current diet and adjusting macronutrient ratios.",
        "Prescribing a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Before making drastic changes, it's crucial to assess the client's current diet for hidden sugars and processed foods, and to adjust macronutrient ratios (protein, fat, fiber) for better satiety and blood sugar control, as highlighted in personalized nutrition strategies."

      "id": "q11_2",
      "question": "Which type of exercise is MOST effective for improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels in women with PCOS, based on recent research?",
      "options": [

        "Swimming for overall cardiovascular health."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Studies suggest that HIIT combined with resistance training is highly effective for improving insulin sensitivity and reducing androgen levels due to its impact on muscle mass and glucose metabolism. This approach was emphasized in the exercise prescription section."

    {
      "id": "q11_3",
      "question": "A client with PCOS reports chronic stress and difficulty sleeping. Which stress management technique would MOST directly address the neuroendocrine imbalances associated with these symptoms?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation, particularly focusing on interoceptive awareness (body sensations), can directly modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and reduce cortisol levels, addressing the root of neuroendocrine imbalances caused by chronic stress. This was a key point in the stress management deep dive."
