            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important factor to consider when evaluating the quality of a research study on PCOS?",
            "options": ["The number of authors involved", "The impact factor of the journal", "The study design and methodology", "The funding source of the study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study design and methodology (e.g., randomized controlled trial, blinding) are crucial for determining the validity and reliability of the results. While other factors can be relevant, they are secondary to the rigor of the research process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A meta-analysis combines the results of multiple studies to:",
            "options": ["Increase the sample size and statistical power", "Exclude studies with conflicting results", "Rely on a single, high-quality study", "Guarantee statistically significant results"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses pool data from several studies to create a larger sample size, thereby increasing the statistical power to detect a true effect and provide a more precise estimate of the intervention's impact."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to the evidence presented, which macronutrient distribution has shown the MOST consistent benefit in improving insulin sensitivity and hormonal profiles in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat", "Low-carbohydrate, high-fat", "Balanced macronutrient distribution", "High-protein, low-carbohydrate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While individual needs vary, a balanced macronutrient distribution, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods, has generally demonstrated the most consistent benefits in improving insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance in PCOS. Drastic macronutrient shifts may not be sustainable or suitable for all individuals."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which micronutrient has been shown in multiple studies to potentially improve insulin sensitivity and reduce testosterone levels in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Vitamin D", "Magnesium", "Inositol"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Several studies have indicated that inositol, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, can improve insulin sensitivity, lower testosterone levels, and improve ovulation in women with PCOS."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, 32, with PCOS, reports struggling with motivation to exercise. Based on research-backed strategies, what is the MOST effective initial approach to recommend?",
            "options": ["Intense HIIT workouts 5 times a week", "Daily 60-minute runs", "Finding enjoyable activities and starting with small, achievable goals", "Weightlifting with a personal trainer"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The research emphasizes the importance of finding enjoyable activities and setting realistic goals to improve adherence and long-term success. Starting small, such as 10-15 minutes of enjoyable activity, can build momentum and increase motivation."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Research indicates that poor sleep quality can exacerbate PCOS symptoms. Which of the following is a research-backed recommendation to improve sleep hygiene?",
            "options": ["Taking melatonin supplements every night", "Drinking alcohol before bed", "Establishing a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends", "Using electronic devices until falling asleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule helps regulate the body's natural circadian rhythm, promoting better sleep quality. The other options are generally discouraged as they can disrupt sleep patterns."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which of the following pharmacological interventions is commonly used to manage insulin resistance in women with PCOS?",
            "options": ["Levothyroxine", "Metformin", "Oral contraceptives", "Clomiphene citrate"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for managing insulin resistance in PCOS. It helps improve insulin sensitivity and can contribute to improved hormonal balance and menstrual regularity."

            "options": ["Implementing specific interventions", "Tracking progress and adjusting the plan", "Understanding the client's individual needs and goals", "Evaluating the latest research findings"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE Framework™ emphasizes a client-centered approach, starting with a thorough understanding of the individual's unique circumstances, goals, and preferences before implementing any interventions."

This finding suggests:",
            "options": ["Metformin is ineffective for women with PCOS and prediabetes.", "Lifestyle interventions are unnecessary when using metformin.", "A combined approach may offer synergistic benefits for glycemic control.", "Lifestyle interventions are only effective in women who cannot tolerate metformin."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The statistic suggests that combining lifestyle interventions with metformin may lead to better glycemic control compared to using metformin alone, indicating a potential synergistic effect."
