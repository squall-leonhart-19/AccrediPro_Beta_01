      "id": "q16_1",
      "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS, insulin resistance, and NAFLD presents with elevated ALT and AST levels. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial dietary recommendation?",
      "options": [
        "A very low-fat diet (less than 10% of calories from fat).",
        "A moderate carbohydrate diet with an emphasis on low glycemic index foods.",
        "A ketogenic diet with strict carbohydrate restriction.",
        "A high-protein diet focusing on animal-based protein sources."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A moderate carbohydrate diet with low glycemic index foods helps manage insulin resistance and NAFLD. Very low-fat diets may not be sustainable, ketogenic diets can be challenging to adhere to long-term, and high animal protein intake can exacerbate inflammation."

    {
      "id": "q16_2",
      "question": "Which of the following autoimmune conditions is MOST commonly associated with PCOS?",
      "options": [
        "Rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",
        "Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",
        "Multiple sclerosis."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland, is the most commonly associated autoimmune condition with PCOS. Studies suggest a bidirectional relationship, with PCOS increasing the risk of Hashimoto's and vice versa."

      "id": "q16_3",
      "question": "A 35-year-old client with PCOS is undergoing IVF. Her physician prescribes metformin. What is the PRIMARY reason for this medication in this context?",
      "options": [
        "To induce ovulation directly.",
        "To improve egg quality and reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).",
        "To prevent gestational diabetes during pregnancy.",
        "To treat underlying anxiety related to infertility."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Metformin can improve egg quality and reduce the risk of OHSS in women with PCOS undergoing IVF. While it can indirectly impact ovulation, its primary role in IVF is related to improving oocyte quality."

    {
      "id": "q16_4",
      "question": "According to the Rotterdam criteria, how many features must be present for a diagnosis of PCOS?",
      "options": [
        "All three of the following: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries.",
        "Any two of the following: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries.",
        "Hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction only.",
        "Polycystic ovaries only."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Rotterdam criteria require the presence of any two of the following three features: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries (on ultrasound), after exclusion of other etiologies."

    {
      "id": "q16_5",
      "question": "A 16-year-old adolescent presents with irregular menses, acne, and hirsutism. Her mother has a history of type 2 diabetes. Which of the following is the MOST important initial screening test?",
      "options": [
        "Fasting lipid panel.",
        "Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).",
        "Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).",
        "Complete blood count (CBC)."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Given the adolescent's symptoms and family history of type 2 diabetes, an OGTT is crucial to assess for insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, which are common in adolescents with PCOS and carry long-term metabolic health implications."

    {
      "id": "q16_6",
      "question": "A 52-year-old woman with a history of PCOS is now perimenopausal. She reports worsening hot flashes and sleep disturbances. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation regarding hormone therapy?",
      "options": [
        "Initiate combined hormone therapy (estrogen and progestin) immediately.",
        "Consider bioidentical hormone therapy without medical supervision.",
        "Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy with her physician, considering her PCOS history and cardiovascular risk factors.",
        "Recommend phytoestrogen supplements as the primary treatment."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Given her history of PCOS and potential cardiovascular risk factors, a thorough discussion with her physician is essential before initiating hormone therapy. This allows for a personalized assessment of risks and benefits. Phytoestrogens may provide some relief but are generally not as effective as hormone therapy for managing menopausal symptoms."

    {
      "id": "q16_7",
      "question": "Which of the following supplements has the STRONGEST evidence for improving insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS?",
      "options": [
        "Vitamin D.",
        "Omega-3 fatty acids.",
        "Myo-inositol.",
        "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Myo-inositol has the strongest evidence for improving insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS. A 2018 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that myo-inositol significantly reduced insulin resistance and improved ovulatory function (Unfer et al., 2018)."

    {
      "id": "q16_8",
      "question": "A client asks about using off-label medications to treat her PCOS symptoms. What is the MOST ETHICAL response?",
      "options": [
        "Inform her that off-label use is always unethical and should be avoided.",
        "Explain that you are not qualified to discuss medications and refer her back to her prescribing physician.",
        "Discuss the potential benefits and risks of the off-label medication, based on available evidence, and emphasize the importance of consulting with her prescribing physician.",
        "Recommend a specific dosage and brand of the off-label medication based on anecdotal evidence."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "It is crucial to stay within your scope of practice and avoid providing medical advice. Referring the client back to their prescribing physician ensures they receive appropriate medical guidance regarding medication use."

      "id": "q16_9",
      "question": "A 28-year-old client with PCOS and infertility has been working with you for six months. She has made significant lifestyle changes but has not yet conceived. What is the MOST appropriate next step in her comprehensive case management?",
      "options": [
        "Recommend she discontinue all supplements immediately.",
        "Encourage her to continue with lifestyle modifications and supplements for another six months before considering further interventions.",
        "Collaborate with her reproductive endocrinologist to discuss further diagnostic testing and potential ART options.",
        "Suggest she try a completely different dietary approach, such as a carnivore diet."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Collaboration with a reproductive endocrinologist is essential when lifestyle modifications and supplements are insufficient for achieving pregnancy. Further diagnostic testing and ART options should be explored under medical supervision."

      "id": "q16_10",
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST common symptom of PCOS in adolescents?",
      "options": [
        "Weight loss.",
        "Regular menstrual cycles.",
        "Hirsutism.",
        "Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) or oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstruation) is the most common symptom of PCOS in adolescents. Irregular cycles are often the first sign that something is amiss."
