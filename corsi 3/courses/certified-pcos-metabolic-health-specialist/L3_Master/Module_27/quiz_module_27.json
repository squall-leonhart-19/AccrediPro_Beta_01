            "options": ["Initiating high-intensity interval training (HIIT) 5 days/week.", "Prescribing a high-dose estrogen birth control pill.", "Implementing a low-glycemic index diet and moderate exercise.", "Recommending a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) for rapid weight loss."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-glycemic index diet and moderate exercise can improve insulin sensitivity and hormone balance, increasing the likelihood of ovulation in women with PCOS. The other options are generally contraindicated or less effective for this specific scenario."
