            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS presents with hirsutism, irregular cycles, and elevated androgens. Based on the advanced PCOS subtyping model, which subtype is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Reproductive/Classic PCOS", "Metabolic PCOS", "Inflammatory PCOS", "Androgen Excess PCOS"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reproductive/Classic PCOS presents with hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. This client's symptoms align most closely with this subtype."
        },
        {
            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic differentiating metabolic PCOS from other subtypes?",
            "options": ["Normal androgen levels", "Severe insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction", "Regular menstrual cycles", "Absence of polycystic ovaries"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Metabolic PCOS is characterized by significant insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic abnormalities, even if androgen levels and menstrual cycles are less affected."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Women with PCOS are at higher risk of OHSS due to their increased ovarian sensitivity to gonadotropins. Careful monitoring and individualized stimulation protocols are essential."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is involved in numerous enzymatic reactions, including those related to neurotransmitter synthesis (serotonin, dopamine) and stress response. Deficiencies can exacerbate anxiety and depression, which are commonly associated with PCOS. Studies show a link between low magnesium levels and increased anxiety in women with PCOS."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Metabolic flexibility refers to the body's ability to efficiently switch between using carbohydrates and fats for fuel. Factors like chronic stress, poor sleep, and gut dysbiosis can impair metabolic flexibility, hindering weight loss even with dietary changes. Addressing these root causes is crucial before making drastic dietary modifications."
