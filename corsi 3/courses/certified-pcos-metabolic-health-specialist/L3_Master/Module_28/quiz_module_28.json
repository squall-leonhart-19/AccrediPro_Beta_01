            "question": "A 28-year-old client with PCOS presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports missing her period for two months and has a history of infertility. Which of the following is the MOST immediate concern to rule out?",
            "options": ["Ovarian cyst rupture", "Ectopic pregnancy", "Appendicitis", "Kidney stones"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening condition and must be ruled out immediately in a woman with PCOS presenting with these symptoms and a history of infertility. The other options are possible but less immediately life-threatening."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A 35-year-old client with PCOS and a history of binge eating disorder presents to your office in distress. She reveals she has been restricting her food intake severely for the past week and has taken a large dose of laxatives yesterday. What is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Advise her to drink plenty of fluids and monitor her symptoms.", "Refer her immediately to a medical facility for evaluation and stabilization.", "Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss her eating disorder in more detail.", "Recommend a self-help book on managing eating disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client's recent behavior (severe restriction and laxative abuse) indicates a potential medical emergency due to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Immediate referral to a medical facility is crucial."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A client with PCOS and severe insulin resistance has been prescribed metformin. She calls complaining of persistent nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping, even after reducing the dose. What is the NEXT best step?",
            "options": ["Advise her to stop taking metformin immediately.", "Switch her to the extended-release formulation of metformin and suggest taking it with food.", "Prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication.", "Suggest she try an over-the-counter probiotic."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The extended-release formulation of metformin is often better tolerated. Taking it with food can also help minimize gastrointestinal side effects. Discontinuing metformin abruptly could worsen insulin resistance. Anti-diarrheals and probiotics may provide symptomatic relief but don't address the underlying issue."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recurrent pregnancy loss is emotionally devastating. Referral to a reproductive endocrinologist is essential for further investigation and potential treatment. A therapist specializing in grief and loss can provide crucial emotional support."

            "options": ["Contact her family and inform them of the situation.", "Encourage her to practice mindfulness and meditation.", "Initiate emergency mental health services, such as calling a crisis hotline or arranging for immediate psychiatric evaluation.", "Reassure her that things will get better and schedule a follow-up appointment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suicidal ideation with a plan constitutes a psychiatric emergency. Immediate intervention is crucial to ensure the client's safety. Contacting emergency services is the priority."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2020 study by Chittenden et al. highlighted a statistically significant increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with PCOS, primarily due to prolonged exposure to unopposed estrogen."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "You suspect a client with PCOS is at high risk for endometrial cancer. What screening protocol is MOST appropriate?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Detailed documentation is crucial in such situations. It protects you and provides a record of the client's statements. Offering legal advice is outside your scope of practice. Contacting the previous provider without the client's consent would be a breach of confidentiality."
