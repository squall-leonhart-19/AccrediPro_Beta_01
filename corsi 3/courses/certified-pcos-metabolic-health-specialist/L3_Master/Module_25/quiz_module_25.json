                "Supervision focuses primarily on administrative tasks, while mentoring centers on career development.",
                "Supervision is typically short-term and evaluative, while mentoring is usually longer-term and focuses on holistic professional growth.",
                "Supervision is only necessary for newly licensed practitioners, while mentoring is beneficial for professionals at all career stages.",
                "Supervision is mandated by regulatory bodies, while mentoring is purely voluntary and informal."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SBI model provides a structured approach to feedback by specifying the situation, the specific behavior observed, and the impact of that behavior. This clarity helps the recipient understand the feedback and make targeted improvements."
