            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique is MOST useful in identifying insulin resistance beyond standard lab markers, as highlighted in the lesson on Advanced Assessment Techniques?",
            "options": ["Basal Body Temperature (BBT) charting", "Advanced Lipid Panel (including particle size)", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "Salivary Hormone Testing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An advanced lipid panel, including particle size, can reveal patterns indicative of insulin resistance, such as small, dense LDL particles, even when standard markers are within normal ranges. This was emphasized in the Advanced Assessment Techniques lesson."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client, Sarah, presents with PCOS, anxiety, and difficulty adhering to dietary changes. According to the THRIVE framework, which aspect should be prioritized FIRST to improve her overall well-being and adherence?",
            "options": ["Targeted Supplementation (T)", "Hormone Optimization (H)", "Restorative Lifestyle (R)", "Individualized Nutrition (I)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all components of THRIVE are important, addressing Restorative Lifestyle (R) factors like sleep, stress management, and mindfulness is crucial for building a foundation for sustainable change and improving adherence to other interventions. Addressing anxiety will improve her ability to make dietary changes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Motivational interviewing allows the practitioner to understand the client's perspective, validate their feelings, and work collaboratively to address their concerns, fostering trust and improving adherence."

            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin B12", "Selenium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in women with PCOS and has been linked to increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose metabolism. A 2023 meta-analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between Vitamin D levels and insulin resistance (p<0.01)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PCOS and Hashimoto's are often interconnected through inflammatory and autoimmune pathways. A systems-based approach requires addressing both conditions simultaneously to achieve optimal outcomes."
