            "question": "When synthesizing assessment data for a client with PCOS, which of the following is the MOST crucial initial step?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending a ketogenic diet.", "Identifying and prioritizing the client's specific PCOS phenotypes and related metabolic imbalances.", "Prescribing a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program.", "Focusing solely on weight loss as the primary intervention target."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying and prioritizing the client's specific PCOS phenotypes and related metabolic imbalances is the most crucial initial step because it allows for personalized and targeted interventions. Ignoring this step can lead to ineffective or even harmful recommendations."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with PCOS presents with insulin resistance and elevated androgens. Which nutritional intervention is MOST likely to improve insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": ["A very-low-fat diet.", "A high-carbohydrate, low-protein diet.", "A diet rich in fiber, lean protein, and healthy fats with a moderate carbohydrate intake.", "A diet consisting primarily of processed foods with added sugars."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in fiber, lean protein, and healthy fats with a moderate carbohydrate intake is most likely to improve insulin sensitivity. This approach helps stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce insulin spikes, and support overall metabolic health."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to research on exercise and PCOS, which type of physical activity has been shown to be MOST effective in reducing abdominal fat and improving metabolic markers?",
            "options": ["Prolonged, low-intensity cardio.", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Yoga and Pilates.", "Resistance training combined with moderate-intensity cardio."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Resistance training combined with moderate-intensity cardio has been shown to be most effective in reducing abdominal fat and improving metabolic markers. This combination helps build muscle mass, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote fat loss."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "Which stress management technique has demonstrated the HIGHEST efficacy in reducing cortisol levels and improving mood in women with PCOS, as evidenced by clinical trials?",
            "options": ["Watching television for relaxation.", "Engaging in regular social media use.", "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR).", "Consuming caffeinated beverages."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing cortisol levels and improving mood in women with PCOS. MBSR helps regulate the stress response and promote overall well-being."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "A client with PCOS is experiencing significant hair loss (alopecia). Which supplement is MOST likely to be beneficial in addressing this symptom?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C.", "Iron, especially if ferritin levels are low.", "Calcium.", "Vitamin E."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron supplementation, especially if ferritin levels are low, is most likely to be beneficial in addressing hair loss (alopecia). Iron deficiency can contribute to hair loss, and correcting this deficiency can promote hair regrowth."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "Which behavioral modification technique is MOST effective in helping a client with PCOS adhere to a new dietary plan?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Encouraging self-monitoring, goal setting, and positive reinforcement is the most effective behavioral modification technique. This approach empowers clients to take ownership of their health and make sustainable lifestyle changes."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "When monitoring a client's progress in a PCOS management program, which of the following is the MOST reliable indicator of improved insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": ["Changes in hair growth patterns.", "Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels.", "Subjective reports of energy levels.", "Weight loss alone."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels are the most reliable indicators of improved insulin sensitivity. These objective measures provide direct insight into glucose metabolism and insulin function."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "In a case study presented in the course, a client with PCOS and anxiety experienced significant improvements in both conditions after incorporating which intervention?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin D supplementation alone.", "A combination of dietary changes, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).", "Strict calorie restriction.", "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recommending a low-FODMAP diet and assessing for potential food sensitivities is the most appropriate next step. Digestive issues are common in PCOS, and addressing potential triggers can improve gut health and reduce discomfort."
