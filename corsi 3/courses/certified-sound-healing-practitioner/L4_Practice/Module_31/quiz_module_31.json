            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Defining your ideal client allows you to focus your marketing efforts on the people most likely to benefit from and invest in your services, making your marketing more efficient and effective."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["Posting too frequently.", "Engaging with their audience.", "Providing valuable content.", "Not having a clear call to action."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Many sound healers fail to include a clear call to action (e.g., 'Book a session today!') in their social media posts, which limits their ability to convert followers into clients. As shown in the lesson, a CTA increases conversion rates by approximately 15%."

            "options": ["Posting generic content about sound healing on all social media platforms.", "Creating targeted content addressing the specific stressors and needs of women aged 35-50 and sharing it on platforms they frequent.", "Lowering her prices to attract more clients.", "Ignoring social media and relying solely on word-of-mouth referrals."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Targeted content that speaks directly to the needs and interests of the ideal client is more likely to resonate and attract the right audience. Generic content and simply lowering prices are unlikely to be as effective."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While conversion rates vary, a well-optimized landing page typically achieves a conversion rate of around 2-5%, meaning that 2-5 out of every 100 visitors will take the desired action (e.g., booking a session). This is a key benchmark to aim for."
