            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a core principle of sound activation, as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": ["Intention", "Resonance", "Entrainment", "Amplification"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Amplification, while important in sound production, is not one of the three core principles of sound activation. Intention, resonance, and entrainment are foundational to the process."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to research cited in Lesson 2, sound stimulation can influence the body's natural healing mechanisms by stimulating which of the following?",
            "options": ["Increased cortisol production", "Decreased immune cell activity", "Nitric oxide release", "Reduced blood flow to injured tissues"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sound stimulation can promote healing by increasing nitric oxide release, which enhances blood flow and reduces inflammation. Studies show nitric oxide plays a crucial role in tissue repair and immune response."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sacral Chakra is frequently linked to the 417 Hz frequency, believed to support emotional release and transformation. The Root, Solar Plexus, and Heart Chakras are associated with different frequencies and energies."

            "options": ["Delta", "Theta", "Alpha", "Beta"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Beta brainwaves (12-30 Hz) are associated with active thinking, focus, and alertness. Sound frequencies can be used to entrain the brain towards this state, promoting mental clarity."
