            "question": "Which of the following frequencies is MOST commonly associated with inducing a Theta brainwave state using binaural beats, which is often used for deep relaxation and meditation?",
            "options": ["432 Hz", "528 Hz", "4-7 Hz", "12-15 Hz"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Theta brainwaves, associated with deep relaxation and meditative states, typically fall within the range of 4-7 Hz. Binaural beats within this range can help entrain the brain to this state."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing anxiety and difficulty breathing. Which vocal toning technique might be MOST appropriate as an initial intervention to promote relaxation and improve breath control?",
            "options": ["Prolonged chanting of 'OM'", "Rapid, percussive vocalizations", "Humming with extended exhales", "High-pitched, sustained vowel sounds"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Humming with extended exhales can stimulate the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and slowing the breath, which is beneficial for anxiety. The extended exhale is key."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the vagus nerve is responsible for social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal complex", "Ventral vagal complex", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Parasympathetic nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal complex is associated with social engagement, communication, and feelings of safety. Activation of this branch promotes connection and reduces feelings of threat."

            "options": ["Using bowls of the same size", "Using bowls tuned to random frequencies", "Understanding the mathematical relationships between frequencies and musical intervals", "Striking the bowls as loudly as possible"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Understanding the mathematical relationships between frequencies and musical intervals (e.g., octaves, fifths) is crucial for creating harmonious and pleasant multi-bowl soundscapes. Dissonance can be jarring and counterproductive."
