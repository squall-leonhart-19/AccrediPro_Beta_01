            "question": "Which tuning fork technique is MOST effective for releasing tension held in the psoas muscle, according to the lesson?",
            "options": ["Applying the weighted tuning fork directly to the sacrum.", "Using binaural beats with two unweighted tuning forks near the ears.", "Employing the 'rake and release' technique along the lumbar spine with a weighted tuning fork.", "Holding a single unweighted tuning fork over the solar plexus."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'rake and release' technique along the lumbar spine, using a weighted tuning fork, is specifically designed to address tension patterns in the psoas muscle by stimulating mechanoreceptors and promoting fascial release."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'stuck' and unable to express themselves. Which vocal toning technique would be MOST appropriate as a starting point?",
            "options": ["Rapid, forceful chanting of 'OM'.", "Prolonged humming on a comfortable vowel sound, focusing on resonance in the chest.", "Aggressive throat singing to release blocked energy.", "Silent, internal visualization of sound."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle humming promotes relaxation and encourages self-awareness of the vocal cords and breath, making it a safe and effective starting point for clients experiencing emotional blockage."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "What is the primary principle behind harmonic resonance and entrainment when using crystal bowls?",
            "options": ["Amplifying the bowl's fundamental frequency to override other sounds.", "Using inharmonic frequencies to disrupt stagnant energy.", "Matching the bowl's frequency to the client's dominant brainwave state to promote synchronization.", "Randomly selecting bowls to create unpredictable sound patterns."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Harmonic resonance and entrainment involve matching the frequency of the crystal bowl to the client's existing brainwave state, facilitating a shift towards desired states like alpha or theta."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which advanced gong technique is MOST suited for inducing a deep meditative state?",
            "options": ["Striking the gong forcefully and repeatedly with a hard mallet.", "Using sustained, gentle strokes with a soft mallet to create a wash of sound with layered frequencies.", "Playing the gong at a very high volume to overwhelm the senses.", "Using a single, short strike followed by complete silence."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustained, gentle strokes create a complex tapestry of frequencies that can induce deep relaxation and meditative states by stimulating the vagus nerve and promoting parasympathetic nervous system activation."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "A client with a history of trauma suddenly becomes dissociative during a sound healing session. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?",
            "options": ["Continue the session without interruption, as the dissociation may be a release.", "Immediately stop all sound and encourage the client to ground themselves by focusing on their breath and surroundings.", "Increase the volume and intensity of the sound to bring the client back to the present.", "Ask the client to describe their traumatic experience in detail."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount. Immediately ceasing the sound and facilitating grounding helps the client regain a sense of control and re-establish connection with the present moment, preventing further distress and potential re-traumatization."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the SONAR framework, what does the 'N' represent?",
            "options": ["Nervous System Regulation", "Neuroplasticity Activation", "Non-Judgmental Awareness", "Natural Soundscapes"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the SONAR framework, 'N' stands for Nervous System Regulation, emphasizing the importance of using sound to promote balance and resilience within the autonomic nervous system."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which instrument combination is MOST likely to promote a sense of grounding and stability?",
            "options": ["High-pitched crystal bowls and wind chimes.", "Low-frequency gongs and earth-toned Tibetan singing bowls.", "Flutes and high-pitched singing bowls", "Ocean drum and rainstick."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low-frequency sounds are generally associated with grounding and stability. Gongs and earth-toned singing bowls resonate with the lower chakras and promote a sense of connection to the earth."

            "question": "A client is seeking sound healing for chronic pain management. Which of the following instrument combinations would be MOST suitable based on the principles discussed?",
            "options": ["Tuning forks tuned to specific anatomical frequencies and crystal bowls tuned to delta brainwave frequencies.", "Only high frequency crystal bowls played in rapid succession.", "Loud, percussive drumming and chanting.", "Harsh, dissonant sounds to disrupt pain signals."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Tuning forks address specific anatomical issues. Delta frequencies promote deep relaxation and pain reduction. This combination helps to address both the physical and neurological aspects of chronic pain."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "What is the MOST important ethical consideration when offering sound healing services to vulnerable populations, such as those with mental health conditions?",
            "options": ["Ensuring that the client fully understands the limitations of sound healing and that it is not a replacement for conventional medical or psychological treatment.", "Promising specific outcomes and guarantees of healing.", "Encouraging clients to discontinue their prescribed medications.", "Diagnosing and treating medical conditions with sound."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Transparency and realistic expectations are crucial. It is essential to emphasize that sound healing is a complementary therapy and not a substitute for professional medical or psychological care."
