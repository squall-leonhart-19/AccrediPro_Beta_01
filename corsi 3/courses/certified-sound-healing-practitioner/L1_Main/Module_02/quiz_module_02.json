            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "What is the fundamental principle underlying the concept of resonance in sound healing?",
            "options": ["Amplification of specific frequencies through sympathetic vibration.", "Cancellation of opposing sound waves to induce relaxation.", "The brain's interpretation of sound as harmonic patterns.", "The placebo effect induced by sound-based therapies."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Resonance occurs when an object vibrates at its natural frequency due to the influence of a similar frequency, causing amplification."
