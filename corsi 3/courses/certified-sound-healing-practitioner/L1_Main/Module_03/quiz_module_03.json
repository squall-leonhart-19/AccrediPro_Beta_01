            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of an energy blockage from a sound healer's perspective?",
            "options": ["A complete cessation of energy flow in a specific area.", "A disruption or stagnation of the natural flow of energy within the body's energetic system.", "A purely psychological phenomenon with no physiological basis.", "An overabundance of energy concentrated in a single chakra."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy blockages are best understood as disruptions or stagnations in the flow, not complete stops or purely psychological issues. They can manifest in various ways, not just overabundance."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to research on sound and blockage release, what is the primary mechanism by which sound vibrations can help to release tension and promote healing?",
            "options": ["Directly dissolving physical obstructions like scar tissue.", "Stimulating the release of endorphins and promoting relaxation.", "Magnetically attracting negative energy away from the body.", "Creating a sympathetic resonance that disrupts the blockage's structure."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While resonance plays a role, the primary mechanism is the stimulation of endorphin release and promotion of relaxation, reducing tension that contributes to blockages. Studies (e.g., Kumar et al., 1999) support this."

            "question": "A client reports feeling 'stuck' and unable to move forward in their career. During a sound assessment, you notice a consistent dissonance in the sound of their solar plexus chakra. What might this indicate?",
            "options": ["A blockage related to personal power, self-esteem, and confidence.", "A blockage related to emotional expression and creativity.", "A blockage related to communication and self-expression.", "A blockage related to grounding and security."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The solar plexus chakra is associated with personal power and self-esteem. Dissonance in this area often reflects issues with confidence and the ability to assert oneself."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the metal composition and volume can contribute, the practitioner's intention and focus are paramount in directing the sound's energy for healing, aligning with the principles of energy medicine."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Crystal bowls tend to resonate at higher frequencies and are often used for energizing, while Tibetan bowls create a more grounding and meditative experience with their complex overtones."

            "question": "According to a case study, a client named Sarah, 45, experienced chronic neck pain. After several sessions using tuning forks applied directly to the affected area, her pain decreased by 60% and her range of motion improved significantly. Which principle BEST explains this outcome?",
            "options": ["The placebo effect.", "Mechanical vibration stimulating tissue repair and reducing inflammation.", "The client's belief in the treatment.", "The increased blood flow due to sound waves heating the tissue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tuning forks create targeted vibrations that can stimulate tissue repair, reduce inflammation, and release muscle tension, leading to pain reduction and improved mobility, as seen in Sarah's case."

            "options": ["Sound healing should always be used as a standalone treatment.", "Combining sound healing with other therapies can create a synergistic effect, enhancing overall outcomes.", "Sound healing is incompatible with other modalities and should be avoided in conjunction with them.", "Other modalities dilute the effectiveness of sound healing."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sound healing can be effectively integrated with other modalities like massage, acupuncture, or psychotherapy to create a synergistic effect and enhance the healing process. Research suggests (e.g., Wigram, 2004) shows improved outcomes with integrative approaches."
