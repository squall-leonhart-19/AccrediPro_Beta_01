            "question": "According to research on binaural beats, which frequency range is most associated with promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety?",
            "options": ["40-80 Hz (Gamma)", "12-30 Hz (Beta)", "8-12 Hz (Alpha)", "4-7 Hz (Theta)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are commonly associated with relaxation and a meditative state. Studies show that binaural beats in this range can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of calm. A meta-analysis of 22 studies indicated a statistically significant reduction in anxiety scores following exposure to alpha binaural beats."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of multi-bowl harmonics is to create a rich and layered soundscape that promotes coherence and resonance within the client.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Traveling Sound' technique involves moving around the gong and varying the striking points to create a dynamic and immersive sound experience. This technique is often used to facilitate deep relaxation and transformation. A case study involving a 32-year-old client with PTSD showed significant improvement in sleep quality and emotional regulation after undergoing gong therapy using the 'Traveling Sound' technique."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vocal harmonics, also known as overtone singing, generate specific frequencies that can resonate with and balance the client's energy field. These frequencies can help to release blockages and promote healing. A study published in the 'Journal of Voice' indicated that vocal harmonics can stimulate the vagus nerve, leading to parasympathetic activation."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, what is the role of the vagus nerve in regulating emotional and social behavior?",
            "options": ["It primarily controls motor function.", "It inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system.", "It regulates the 'fight or flight' response only.", "It influences social engagement, emotional regulation, and the 'rest and digest' response."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in regulating emotional and social behavior. Polyvagal Theory suggests that it influences social engagement, emotional regulation, and the 'rest and digest' response by modulating the parasympathetic nervous system. Sound healing can stimulate the vagus nerve, promoting a sense of safety and connection."

Increased anxiety could indicate unresolved trauma or emotional blockages being triggered. Providing a safe and supportive space for processing these emotions is crucial. A trauma-informed approach emphasizes client autonomy and empowerment."
