            "question": "In Cymatics, what does the resulting pattern of vibration demonstrate?",
            "options": ["The inaudible nature of sound.", "The destructive power of certain frequencies.", "The direct relationship between frequency and geometric form.", "The random nature of sound wave propagation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cymatics visually demonstrates how different frequencies create specific and predictable geometric patterns, illustrating a direct relationship between sound and form."

            "question": "When using tuning forks for bone conduction, which anatomical location is typically avoided due to its sensitivity?",
            "options": ["The sternum.", "The mastoid process.", "The tibial tuberosity.", "The iliac crest."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The mastoid process, located behind the ear, is a sensitive area and should be approached with care during bone conduction tuning fork application."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "What is the primary physiological effect of vocal toning on the individual?",
            "options": ["Increased muscle mass.", "Stimulation of the vagus nerve and enhanced parasympathetic response.", "Reduced bone density.", "Suppression of the immune system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vocal toning stimulates the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and a shift towards the parasympathetic nervous system, often referred to as the 'rest and digest' state."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Gong Mastery, which striking technique is most likely to produce a sustained, complex wash of overtones?",
            "options": ["A single, hard strike in the center.", "Multiple, light strokes around the edges.", "Rhythmic tapping with a soft mallet.", "Scraping the surface with a metal object."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple, light strokes around the edges of the gong excite a broader range of vibrational modes, leading to a rich and sustained wash of overtones."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.N.A.R. Framework™, 'A' represents Assessment, which is a critical step in understanding the client's needs and tailoring the sound healing intervention."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "Research suggests that stimulating the vagus nerve through sound can lead to increased Heart Rate Variability (HRV). A higher HRV is generally associated with what?",
            "options": ["Increased stress levels.", "Poor physical fitness.", "Greater resilience and adaptability to stress.", "Increased risk of cardiovascular disease."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A higher HRV indicates greater flexibility in the autonomic nervous system, allowing for better adaptation to stress and improved overall well-being. Studies show a direct correlation between increased HRV and vagal tone."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "When creating a personalized soundscape, what is the MOST important factor to consider when selecting instruments?",
            "options": ["The practitioner's personal preference.", "The client's stated intentions and emotional state.", "The cost and availability of the instruments.", "The instruments' aesthetic appeal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all options may play a role, the client's intentions and emotional state should be the primary driver in instrument selection to create a truly personalized and effective soundscape."

            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key ethical consideration when building a sound healing practice?",
            "options": ["Guaranteeing specific outcomes for every client.", "Providing sound healing services as a replacement for conventional medical treatment.", "Maintaining clear boundaries and respecting client confidentiality.", "Promising immediate and permanent healing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining clear boundaries, respecting confidentiality, and avoiding claims that replace medical advice are crucial for ethical practice. Guaranteeing outcomes or promising cures is unethical and unrealistic."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A recent study (n=60) showed that participants who engaged in regular vocal toning sessions reported a 30% reduction in self-reported anxiety levels compared to the control group. What statistical measure would be most helpful in determining the significance of this finding?",
            "options": ["The average age of participants.", "The t-value and p-value.", "The number of male participants.", "The brand of microphones used."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The t-value and p-value help determine whether the observed difference between the groups is statistically significant and not due to random chance. A lower p-value (typically <0.05) indicates higher significance."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "During a sound healing session, a client reports feeling overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Which of the following actions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Continue the session as planned, as discomfort is a normal part of the healing process.", "Immediately stop the session, create a safe space, and offer grounding techniques.", "Increase the volume and intensity of the sound to break through the resistance.", "Suggest the client is simply being resistant to the healing process."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's comfort and safety is paramount. Stopping the session, creating a safe space, and offering grounding techniques demonstrates ethical and responsible practice."
