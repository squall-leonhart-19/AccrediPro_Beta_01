            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "When receiving information from the Akashic Records, what is the primary difference between direct and indirect reception?",
            "options": ["Direct reception involves using tools like pendulums, while indirect reception is purely intuitive.", "Direct reception is always more accurate than indirect reception.", "Direct reception involves a clear, unfiltered stream of information, while indirect reception involves interpretation and symbolism.", "Direct reception requires a physical connection to the Records, while indirect reception does not."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Direct reception provides a clear, unfiltered stream, while indirect reception requires interpretation. This was highlighted in L1 as a key distinction affecting clarity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 35), asks 'What is my purpose?' Which of the following is the MOST effective focused question to clarify this broad inquiry, as discussed in L2?",
            "options": ["What should I do with my life?", "What are the core values that drive my actions and bring me the most fulfillment?", "Will I find happiness in my current career?", "Am I on the right path?"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most effective focused question is specific, action-oriented, and seeks to uncover underlying values, aligning with the principles of focused questioning detailed in L2. The case study in L2 emphasized specificity for clarity."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "You receive conflicting information from two different sources within the Akashic Records regarding a client's past life. According to L3, what is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Trust the source that feels most intuitively correct.", "Disregard both pieces of information and ask a different question.", "Cross-reference with a third source or use intuitive checks to validate which information resonates most strongly with the client's present circumstances.", "Average the information from both sources to create a compromise."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasizes the importance of cross-referencing and intuitive checks when faced with conflicting information to ensure validation and accuracy. Relying solely on intuition or averaging information is less reliable."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Which of the following strategies is LEAST helpful when navigating ambiguity and uncertainty in an Akashic Records reading (L4)?",
            "options": ["Reframing the question to be more specific.", "Accepting that some information may not be immediately clear and returning to it later.", "Pressing for a definitive answer, even if it feels forced.", "Using visualization techniques to enhance clarity."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pressing for a forced answer can lead to inaccurate or misleading information. L4 emphasizes patience and alternative strategies when encountering ambiguity."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "According to L5, what is the 'projection bias' and how can it hinder accurate information retrieval from the Akashic Records?",
            "options": ["It is the tendency to project one's own beliefs and experiences onto the information received, leading to misinterpretations. Practitioners can mitigate this by practicing self-awareness and impartiality.", "It is a statistical error that occurs when analyzing large datasets within the Records. Using smaller sample sizes can help.", "It is a type of energetic interference caused by negative entities. Protection rituals can prevent this.", "It is the tendency for clients to project their desires onto the reading, influencing the information received. Setting clear boundaries can prevent this."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Projection bias, as explained in L5, involves imposing one's own beliefs, distorting the information. Self-awareness and impartiality are key mitigation strategies. The <span class=\"stat-highlight\">72%</span> misinterpretation rate cited in L5 underscores this risk."
