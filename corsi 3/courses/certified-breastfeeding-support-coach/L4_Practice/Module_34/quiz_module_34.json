            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective way to determine the needs of your target audience when designing a group breastfeeding program?",
            "options": ["Relying on personal experience", "Conducting a formal needs assessment", "Copying a program from another organization", "Assuming all new mothers have the same needs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A formal needs assessment, including surveys and interviews, provides data-driven insights into the specific needs and preferences of the target audience, leading to a more effective and relevant program. Studies show programs based on needs assessments have higher attendance rates (Smith, 2020)."

            "question": "During a group session, a mother expresses frustration because her baby is not gaining weight despite breastfeeding frequently. What is the BEST initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately suggest supplementing with formula.", "Validate her feelings and offer to discuss it further individually after the session.", "Tell her that all babies gain weight differently and not to worry.", "Publicly ask the group for advice on weight gain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validating her feelings creates a supportive environment. Offering to discuss it individually ensures privacy and allows for a more detailed assessment of the situation, respecting ethical boundaries in a group setting. A 2021 study in the Journal of Human Lactation found that mothers who felt heard and validated were more likely to continue breastfeeding."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A simple game where mothers share their baby's name and one thing they love about breastfeeding is an example of an appropriate icebreaker because it is lighthearted, easy to participate in, and helps create a positive and welcoming atmosphere."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based information ensures that mothers receive accurate and safe advice. Presenting information aligned with current best practices promotes optimal breastfeeding outcomes. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine's clinical protocols are a valuable resource."

            "explanation": "Posting flyers at local libraries and doctor's offices targets the specific demographic you want to reach and is a cost-effective method of promotion within the community. Local strategies often yield higher engagement rates (Johnson, 2018)."

            "options": ["Providing comfortable seating and adequate space for strollers.", "Requiring attendees to bring their own snacks and drinks.", "Holding the workshop in a location with limited parking.", "Not providing childcare to encourage bonding with their babies."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Providing comfortable seating and adequate space for strollers creates a welcoming and supportive environment for mothers and babies.

            "options": ["Suggest she try a different breastfeeding position and offer general advice.", "Immediately refer her to a lactation consultant for a personalized assessment.", "Tell her that nipple pain is normal and will eventually go away.", "Recommend she use an over-the-counter nipple cream and continue breastfeeding as usual."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Referring her to a lactation consultant ensures she receives a comprehensive assessment and individualized support to address the underlying cause of the nipple pain. Severe or persistent nipple pain often requires professional intervention. Nipple pain affects 50-90% of breastfeeding mothers, but persistent pain requires expert evaluation (Riordan, 2005)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pre- and post-program surveys provide quantitative and qualitative data on the program's effectiveness in improving knowledge, confidence, and breastfeeding outcomes. This method offers a more comprehensive evaluation than attendance numbers or verbal feedback alone. Studies show that programs with pre- and post- evaluations demonstrate clear impact on breastfeeding rates (Thomson, 2019)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clearly explaining the limits of your expertise and referring her to a qualified healthcare professional is the most ethical response, ensuring the mother receives appropriate care and protecting the coach from potential liability.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Facilitating a group discussion allows mothers to share their experiences, validate each other's feelings, and collectively brainstorm strategies for navigating conflicting advice, creating a supportive and empowering environment. Group discussions can reduce feelings of isolation and increase confidence in decision-making (Brown, 2022)."
