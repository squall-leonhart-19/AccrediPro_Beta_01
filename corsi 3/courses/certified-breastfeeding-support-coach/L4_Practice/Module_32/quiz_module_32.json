            "question": "Which business structure typically offers the most liability protection for a breastfeeding support coach?",
            "options": ["Sole Proprietorship", "Partnership", "Limited Liability Company (LLC)", "S-Corporation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "LLCs provide a legal separation between your personal assets and your business debts, offering significant liability protection compared to sole proprietorships or partnerships. While S-Corps offer tax advantages, the liability protection is similar to an LLC."

            "id": "q32_2",
            "question": "A breastfeeding support coach earned $60,000 in revenue and had $20,000 in deductible business expenses. Assuming a self-employment tax rate of 15.3%, what is their self-employment tax liability (approximately)?",
            "options": ["$3,060", "$6,120", "$9,180", "$12,240"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The taxable base is $60,000 - $20,000 = $40,000.  Half of the self-employment tax is deductible, so the taxable base is reduced by 0.5 * (0.153 * $40,000) = $3,060. The new taxable base is $40,000 - $3,060 = $36,940. The self-employment tax liability is 0.153 * $40,000 = $6,120."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key performance indicator (KPI) specifically relevant to a breastfeeding support coaching business?",
            "options": ["Website traffic", "Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)", "Employee satisfaction", "Social media followers"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CAC measures the cost-effectiveness of acquiring new clients, which is crucial for business growth and sustainability. While website traffic and social media followers can contribute, they don't directly reflect client acquisition costs. Employee satisfaction is less relevant in a solo practice."

            "question": "According to a case study presented in the marketing lesson, which marketing channel yielded the highest return on investment for a breastfeeding support coach?",
            "options": ["Facebook Ads", "Local parenting groups collaborations", "Google Ads", "Print advertising"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that collaborations with local parenting groups generated the highest ROI due to the targeted audience and credibility gained through trusted referrals. Facebook and Google Ads can be effective, but often have a higher cost per acquisition."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "They would save 2 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 8 hours per month. The cost of outsourcing is 8 hours * $30/hour = $240."

            "options": ["Attempt to learn the practice quickly and help the client", "Refer the client to a qualified professional with expertise in that area", "Provide general information but avoid specific advice", "Continue working with the client but clearly state your limitations"],

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive business plan with financial projections provides a roadmap for growth, identifies potential challenges, and ensures the business remains financially viable over time. While the other options are important, they are not as fundamental as a solid business plan."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Segregation of funds is a core principle of financial management. Keeping business and personal finances separate simplifies accounting, reduces the risk of commingling funds, and strengthens liability protection."
