            "question": "A mother with gestational diabetes is struggling to establish breastfeeding in the first few days postpartum. Which of the following is the MOST important initial strategy?",
            "options": ["Suggest supplementing with formula until her milk comes in.", "Encourage frequent skin-to-skin contact and early, frequent breastfeeding attempts.", "Advise her to strictly limit her carbohydrate intake to improve milk production.", "Recommend pumping exclusively for the first week to avoid nipple confusion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequent skin-to-skin contact and early, frequent breastfeeding attempts are crucial to help regulate the infant's blood sugar and stimulate milk production, especially in mothers with gestational diabetes. Supplementation should be considered only if medically indicated after exhausting other options."

            "question": "A mother delivers a preterm infant at 32 weeks gestation. Which of the following best describes the primary benefit of providing her with extensive support for breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["Reduces the risk of maternal postpartum depression.", "Enhances the infant's immune system and promotes optimal neurodevelopment.", "Significantly increases the infant's weight gain compared to formula feeding alone.", "Guarantees the infant will reach full-term developmental milestones faster."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breast milk provides crucial immunological factors and nutrients that are particularly beneficial for premature infants, promoting optimal neurodevelopment and reducing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. While it can contribute to weight gain, the immune and neurodevelopmental benefits are paramount."

            "question": "A breastfeeding mother experiences persistent nipple pain despite a good latch. Which of the following should be your NEXT step in assessment?",
            "options": ["Advise her to switch to pumping exclusively to allow the nipples to heal.", "Thoroughly assess the infant for tongue-tie or other oral motor dysfunction.", "Recommend she use a nipple shield indefinitely to reduce friction.", "Suggest she wean immediately as the pain indicates a medical problem."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A 6-month-old infant suddenly refuses the breast. The mother reports no changes in her diet or routine. What is the MOST likely cause of this refusal?",
            "options": ["The infant is teething and experiencing gum pain.", "The mother's milk supply has suddenly decreased.", "The infant is experiencing nipple confusion from occasional bottle use.", "The infant is experiencing a growth spurt and requires more solid foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Teething can cause temporary breast refusal due to gum pain. While other factors could contribute, teething is a common cause in infants around 6 months old. A thorough assessment is still recommended to rule out other issues."

            "question": "A mother of twins is concerned about producing enough milk for both babies. What is the MOST effective strategy to increase her milk supply?",
            "options": ["Supplementing with formula after each breastfeeding session to conserve her energy.", "Encouraging frequent and simultaneous breastfeeding or pumping sessions.", "Advising her to limit her fluid intake to concentrate the nutrients in her milk.", "Recommending she take galactagogues without addressing breastfeeding technique."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Frequent and simultaneous breastfeeding or pumping sessions are the most effective way to stimulate milk production for twins. This increases demand and signals the body to produce more milk. Galactagogues may be helpful but are secondary to effective milk removal."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a consistent pumping schedule at work and ensuring proper milk storage are crucial for maintaining milk supply and providing breast milk to the baby while the mother is away. This requires careful planning and communication with the employer."

            "question": "A breastfeeding support coach is working with a mother from a culture where colostrum is traditionally considered 'dirty' and is discarded. How should the coach approach this situation?",
            "options": ["Insist that the mother give the colostrum to the baby, emphasizing its nutritional benefits.", "Respectfully acknowledge the cultural belief and provide evidence-based information about the benefits of colostrum, allowing the mother to make an informed decision.", "Immediately report the mother to child protective services for neglecting the baby's nutritional needs.", "Avoid discussing colostrum altogether to avoid offending the mother."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural sensitivity is paramount. The coach should respectfully acknowledge the cultural belief while providing evidence-based information about the benefits of colostrum, empowering the mother to make an informed decision that aligns with her values and the baby's needs. Forcing a belief is unethical and ineffective."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["Encourage her to persevere with breastfeeding, as it can improve her mood and reduce PPD symptoms.", "Advise her to wean immediately to reduce stress and improve her mental health.", "Acknowledge her concerns, provide emotional support, and refer her to a qualified mental health professional for evaluation and treatment.", "Suggest she try herbal remedies for depression to avoid medication that could affect her breast milk."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach's role is to provide support and refer the mother to appropriate professionals. Postpartum depression is a serious condition that requires professional evaluation and treatment. While breastfeeding can be beneficial, it should not be prioritized over the mother's mental health. Referral to a mental health professional is the most appropriate action."
