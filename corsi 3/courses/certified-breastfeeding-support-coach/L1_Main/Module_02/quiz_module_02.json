            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial initial observation to make when assessing a breastfeeding dyad?",
            "options": ["The mother's nipple shape and size.", "The baby's weight percentile.", "The overall interaction and comfort level between mother and baby.", "The brand of breast pump the mother is using."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Observing the interaction and comfort level provides a holistic view of the breastfeeding experience, aligning with recommendations from the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "During a breastfeeding assessment, you observe clicking sounds while the baby is latching. This is MOST likely indicative of:",
            "options": ["A strong, effective latch.", "Possible tongue-tie or latch difficulty.", "Normal swallowing reflexes.", "An oversupply of milk."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clicking sounds often suggest the baby is struggling to maintain suction, which can be related to tongue-tie or other latch issues. A 2021 study in the *Journal of Human Lactation* found a correlation between clicking sounds and inefficient milk transfer."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A mother reports that her baby is fussy at the breast, pulls away frequently, and has green, frothy stools. This could indicate:",
            "options": ["Normal newborn behavior.", "Foremilk/hindmilk imbalance.", "A milk allergy.", "An overactive letdown reflex."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These symptoms are often associated with a foremilk/hindmilk imbalance, where the baby is receiving too much lactose-rich foremilk. Addressing this can improve digestion and reduce fussiness, as highlighted in ABM protocol #3."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A persistent, painful lump could indicate a blocked duct, mastitis, or, rarely, a more serious condition. Prompt medical evaluation is crucial to rule out any underlying issues."

            "explanation": "Acknowledging the mother's dedication and hard work fosters a positive and supportive environment, encouraging her to persist despite challenges. Focusing on effort rather than solely on outcomes is key."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 28-year-old first-time mother, is experiencing significant nipple pain and difficulty latching her newborn.

            "options": ["Recommend exclusive pumping until the nipples heal.", "Suggest using a nipple shield indefinitely.", "Help Sarah reposition the baby to achieve a deeper latch and provide education on proper latch technique.", "Advise Sarah to switch to formula feeding to avoid further pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying cause of the nipple pain (shallow latch) is crucial. Repositioning and education can often improve latch and reduce pain, promoting continued breastfeeding. ABM protocol #23 provides detailed guidance on managing nipple pain."
