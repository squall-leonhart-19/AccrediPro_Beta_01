            "question": "A breastfeeding support coach is working with a client from a culture where colostrum is traditionally considered 'unclean' and discarded. What is the MOST culturally sensitive approach?",
            "options": ["Insist the mother give the colostrum due to its proven benefits.", "Respectfully educate the mother about the benefits of colostrum while acknowledging her cultural beliefs.", "Suggest the mother express and discard only a small portion of the colostrum to appease tradition.", "Immediately refer the client to a lactation consultant."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "question": "A breastfeeding mother is concerned about low milk supply. She is exclusively breastfeeding a 3-week-old infant who has gained 4 ounces in the past week. What is the FIRST step you should recommend?",
            "options": ["Suggest supplementing with formula.", "Recommend pumping after each feeding.", "Assess the infant's latch and feeding effectiveness.", "Advise the mother to take galactagogues."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing the infant's latch and feeding effectiveness is the crucial first step. Poor latch is a common cause of inadequate milk transfer and subsequent low milk supply. Addressing the latch can often improve milk intake and stimulate milk production."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While reassurance, self-care, and social support are important, the severity of her symptoms (overwhelm, anxiety, intrusive thoughts) suggests a possible postpartum mood disorder. A referral to a specialist is crucial for proper assessment and treatment."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Assessing pumping technique and equipment is crucial. 24 oz for twins is likely too low, and optimizing pumping efficiency can significantly increase output. A weighted feed can help determine how much milk the babies are receiving at the breast."
