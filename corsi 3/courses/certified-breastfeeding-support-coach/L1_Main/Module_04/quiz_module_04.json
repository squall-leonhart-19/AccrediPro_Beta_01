            "question": "According to research discussed, what percentage of new mothers stop breastfeeding earlier than intended due to perceived low milk supply?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "20-30%", "30-40%", "40-50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that 30-40% of mothers discontinue breastfeeding prematurely because they believe they have insufficient milk supply, highlighting the importance of accurate education and support."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective initial strategy for teaching a mother with flat or inverted nipples to achieve a good latch?",
            "options": ["Using a nipple shield", "Performing breast massage and hand expression before feeding", "Applying ice packs to the nipples", "Switching to formula feeding temporarily"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breast massage and hand expression can help draw out the nipple and soften the areola, facilitating a better latch for infants with mothers who have flat or inverted nipples. A nipple shield can be used as a second option."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "A mother reports her 3-week-old infant is suddenly fussier at the breast and wants to feed more frequently in the evenings. What is the MOST likely explanation, and how should you advise her?",
            "options": ["The baby is allergic to something in her diet; advise her to eliminate dairy.", "She has a genuine low milk supply; advise her to supplement with formula.", "The baby is going through a growth spurt; advise her to feed on demand and prioritize rest.", "The baby is experiencing colic; advise her to try gripe water."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Increased fussiness and frequent feeding are common signs of a growth spurt. Encouraging on-demand feeding and rest will help the mother's milk supply adjust to the baby's increased needs."

            "question": "What is the recommended maximum time that freshly expressed breast milk can be safely stored at room temperature (77°F or 25°C)?",
            "options": ["2 hours", "4 hours", "6 hours", "8 hours"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to guidelines from organizations like the CDC and WHO, freshly expressed breast milk can be safely stored at room temperature (up to 77°F or 25°C) for up to 4 hours."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bringing hands to mouth is an early hunger cue, often occurring before crying or rooting. Recognizing these early cues allows mothers to feed their babies before they become overly distressed."

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "question": "A mother is concerned that her baby is not getting enough hindmilk. How would you explain the concept of foremilk and hindmilk and advise her?",
            "options": ["Foremilk is produced in the morning, and hindmilk is produced in the evening; advise her to pump and discard the foremilk.", "Foremilk is watery and lacks nutrients, hindmilk is rich in fat; advise her to time each feeding to ensure the baby gets at least 10 minutes on each breast.", "Foremilk is lower in fat and higher in lactose, hindmilk is richer in fat; advise her to allow the baby to fully drain one breast before offering the other.", "Foremilk is easier for the baby to digest, hindmilk is harder; advise her to limit breastfeeding to 5 minutes per breast to avoid digestive upset."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Foremilk, which comes at the beginning of a feeding, is lower in fat and higher in lactose, while hindmilk, which comes later, is richer in fat. Allowing the baby to fully drain one breast ensures they receive adequate hindmilk."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the case study, the cross-cradle hold allowed Maria to have better control over her baby's head and neck, facilitating a deeper and more comfortable latch."

            "question": "What is the primary reason for educating mothers on paced bottle feeding when supplementing with expressed breast milk?",
            "options": ["To increase the baby's intake of breast milk", "To prevent nipple confusion and overfeeding", "To ensure the baby gains weight faster", "To make bottle feeding more convenient for the caregiver"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Paced bottle feeding mimics the flow rate of breastfeeding, helping to prevent nipple confusion and overfeeding, and allowing the baby to control the pace of the feed."
