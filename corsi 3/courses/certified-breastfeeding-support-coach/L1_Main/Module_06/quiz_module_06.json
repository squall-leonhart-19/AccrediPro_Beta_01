            "question": "What is the primary purpose of establishing a breastfeeding baseline in the initial assessment?",
            "options": ["To overwhelm the new mother with data.", "To set unrealistic expectations for milk production.", "To provide a point of comparison for future progress and identify potential issues early.", "To discourage formula supplementation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing a baseline allows for tracking progress and identifying deviations from the norm, enabling early intervention if needed."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST reliable method for tracking a baby's intake during breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["Timing the duration of each feeding.", "Counting the number of sucks per feeding.", "Weighing the baby before and after each feeding (test weighing).", "Observing the mother's subjective feeling of fullness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Test weighing, using a highly accurate scale, provides the most objective measurement of milk intake during a feeding session."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A mother reports consistent nipple pain throughout feedings despite trying different positions. Analyzing tracking data, you notice the baby's weight gain is below the 25th percentile. What is the MOST likely initial action?",
            "options": ["Recommend immediate weaning.", "Suggest exclusive pumping and bottle-feeding.", "Assess the baby's latch and oral anatomy for potential issues like tongue-tie.", "Advise the mother to ignore the pain and continue breastfeeding."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nipple pain and poor weight gain often indicate latch problems or anatomical issues in the baby that need to be addressed."

        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a typical sign of adequate milk supply?",
            "options": ["The baby has 6-8 wet diapers in 24 hours after day 5.", "The baby is gaining weight consistently after the initial weight loss period.", "The baby seems satisfied after most feedings.", "The baby demands to feed every hour around the clock."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While cluster feeding is normal, consistently demanding to feed every hour could indicate other issues beyond just normal feeding patterns, such as latch difficulties or insufficient milk transfer."

            "question": "A mother is experiencing engorgement on day 3 postpartum. What is the FIRST line of recommendation?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent milk removal is the primary intervention for engorgement. Completely emptying the breast is not recommended, as it can stimulate overproduction."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "According to the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine protocol on mastitis, which of the following is TRUE regarding antibiotic use?",
            "options": ["Antibiotics are always necessary for treating mastitis.", "Antibiotics should be started immediately at the first sign of redness.", "Antibiotics should be considered if symptoms do not improve within 12-24 hours of effective milk removal and supportive care.", "Antibiotics should be avoided at all costs due to the risk of antibiotic resistance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ABM protocol emphasizes conservative management with effective milk removal initially, reserving antibiotics for cases that don't improve with these measures."

            "question": "A mother's initial breastfeeding goal was exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. At 3 months, she is returning to work and feels overwhelmed. What is the MOST appropriate adaptation to the breastfeeding plan?",
            "options": ["Insist she continues exclusive breastfeeding regardless of her stress.", "Advise her to switch to formula completely to simplify her life.", "Collaboratively explore options like pumping at work, supplementing with formula as needed, or a combination of both.", "Tell her she has failed and should feel guilty."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flexibility and collaboration are key. The best approach involves finding a solution that meets the mother's needs and circumstances while still supporting breastfeeding to some extent."

            "options": ["Mild nipple pain that resolves after latch correction.", "A plugged duct that resolves with massage.", "A baby who is gaining weight slowly but steadily.", "A mother experiencing fever, chills, and localized breast pain that doesn't improve with milk removal within 24 hours."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fever, chills, and localized breast pain unresponsive to treatment can indicate a more serious infection requiring medical intervention."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing maternal anxiety is crucial. Validating her feelings and providing evidence-based reassurance, while exploring the root cause of her anxiety, is the most supportive approach."
