            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "A mother with a history of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is experiencing delayed lactogenesis. Which of the following interventions is MOST likely to be effective, based on current research?",
            "options": ["Strictly pumping every 2 hours, regardless of milk output.", "Prescription of domperidone, without addressing underlying hormonal imbalances.", "Frequent skin-to-skin contact and addressing any underlying insulin resistance issues.", "Supplementing with formula until milk supply increases."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing insulin resistance, a common issue in women with PCOS, can significantly improve milk supply. Skin-to-skin contact also stimulates prolactin release."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A preterm infant, born at 32 weeks gestation, is having difficulty coordinating suck, swallow, and breathe. What is the MOST appropriate initial feeding strategy?",
            "options": ["Forceful bottle feeding to ensure adequate caloric intake.", "Nipple shield use to improve latch efficiency.", "Cup feeding or syringe feeding to minimize energy expenditure and respiratory distress.", "Exclusive pumping and bottle feeding of expressed breast milk."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Preterm infants often lack the coordination for effective breastfeeding. Cup or syringe feeding allows for controlled milk delivery and reduces the risk of aspiration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A mother of twins is concerned about producing enough milk. What is the MOST effective strategy to maximize milk production in this situation?",
            "options": ["Exclusive pumping for the first 2 weeks to establish a strong supply.", "Supplementing one twin with formula to reduce demand on the mother's body.", "Frequent and simultaneous breastfeeding or pumping, aiming for at least 8-12 times per day.", "Restricting fluid intake to concentrate milk production."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent and simultaneous milk removal is crucial for stimulating sufficient milk production for twins. The increased demand signals the body to produce more milk."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A woman is attempting induced lactation to breastfeed her adopted infant. After several weeks of stimulation, she is expressing only a small amount of colostrum. What is the next BEST step?",
            "options": ["Advising her to discontinue the attempt as it is unlikely to be successful.", "Continuing the stimulation protocol, adding galactagogues, and regularly assessing infant weight gain after supplementation.", "Immediately starting formula feeding to ensure the infant's nutritional needs are met.", "Recommending surgical intervention to increase milk duct development."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Induced lactation requires patience and persistence. Adding galactagogues and closely monitoring infant weight gain while supplementing is crucial to ensure the infant thrives while supporting the mother's efforts."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother reports severe nipple pain that started suddenly. Upon examination, you observe a shiny, flaky rash on both nipples and shooting pains in the breasts. What is the MOST likely cause?",
            "options": ["Poor latch technique.", "Vasospasm.", "Bacterial infection.", "Nipple thrush (yeast infection)."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The shiny, flaky rash and shooting pains are classic symptoms of nipple thrush. The pain is often described as burning or shooting."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A mother is concerned about low milk supply, despite breastfeeding frequently and having a good latch. She reports feeling stressed and anxious. What is the MOST important initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a galactagogue to immediately boost milk production.", "Recommending a weighted test feed to quantify milk transfer.", "Assessing and addressing the mother's stress and anxiety levels, while also evaluating for other potential causes of low supply.", "Advising her to supplement with formula until her stress decreases."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stress and anxiety can significantly impact milk production. Addressing these factors is crucial, alongside a thorough assessment for other potential causes of low supply, such as hormonal imbalances or anatomical issues."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "A mother is experiencing significant emotional distress and guilt as she begins to wean her 18-month-old child. Which of the following approaches is MOST supportive?",
            "options": ["Encouraging her to wean abruptly to minimize prolonged emotional discomfort.", "Validating her feelings, exploring her reasons for weaning, and offering strategies for a gradual and child-led approach.", "Dismissing her feelings as hormonal fluctuations and advising her to focus on the benefits of weaning.", "Recommending she continue breastfeeding indefinitely to avoid any negative emotional impact."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and validating the mother's feelings is essential. A gradual and child-led approach can ease the transition and minimize emotional distress."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "A client discloses that she is using cannabis to manage postpartum anxiety while breastfeeding. What is the MOST ETHICALLY sound course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately report her to child protective services.", "Advise her to stop breastfeeding immediately due to the risks associated with cannabis use.", "Provide her with evidence-based information about the potential risks of cannabis use during breastfeeding and explore alternative, safer options for managing her anxiety.", "Ignore the disclosure to maintain client confidentiality."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing evidence-based information and exploring safer alternatives is the most ethical approach. Reporting should only be considered if there is imminent risk of harm to the child."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A mother reports persistent breast pain despite having ruled out infection, poor latch, and vasospasm. The pain is localized and sharp. What condition should be considered?",
            "options": ["Mastitis", "Plugged duct", "Breast cancer", "Nerve pain"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Localized, sharp breast pain, after ruling out other common causes, may indicate nerve pain. Referral to a physician is important."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother is diagnosed with gestational diabetes. How can this impact her milk supply and what support should be provided?",
            "options": ["Gestational diabetes has no impact on milk supply; no specific support is needed.", "Gestational diabetes can delay lactogenesis and increase risk of low milk supply. Monitor closely, encourage frequent milk removal, and address insulin resistance.", "Gestational diabetes always leads to oversupply; advise the mother to pump less frequently.", "Gestational diabetes requires immediate weaning and formula feeding to protect the infant's health."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestational diabetes can delay lactogenesis due to hormonal imbalances. Proactive monitoring, frequent milk removal, and addressing insulin resistance are crucial for supporting milk supply."
