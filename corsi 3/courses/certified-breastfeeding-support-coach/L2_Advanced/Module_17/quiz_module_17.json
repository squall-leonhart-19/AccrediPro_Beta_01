            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A mother presents with persistent nipple pain despite a seemingly correct latch. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in your assessment?",
            "options": ["Recommend immediate weaning.", "Suggest using a nipple shield indefinitely.", "Evaluate for underlying causes such as vasospasm or infection.", "Advise her to pump exclusively for two weeks."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent nipple pain despite a good latch warrants investigation for underlying causes. Vasospasm and infection are common culprits and require specific management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A mother of twins reports struggling to produce enough milk despite frequent nursing and pumping. What intervention, supported by research, is MOST likely to increase her milk supply significantly?",
            "options": ["Suggesting she only breastfeed one baby at a time.", "Recommending galactagogues without addressing milk removal.", "Implementing a power pumping routine combined with optimizing latch and frequency of milk removal.", "Advising her to supplement with formula to reduce the demand on her breasts."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Power pumping mimics cluster feeding and, when combined with optimized latch and frequent milk removal, is a highly effective strategy for increasing milk supply, particularly in mothers of multiples. A 2019 study in the *Journal of Human Lactation* demonstrated a significant increase in milk volume with this approach."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A preterm infant (34 weeks gestation) is struggling to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing at the breast. What is the MOST appropriate initial strategy?",
            "options": ["Immediately introduce bottle feeding.", "Encourage skin-to-skin contact and paced bottle feeding.", "Refer to a speech therapist or occupational therapist specializing in infant feeding.", "Recommend exclusive pumping and bottle feeding until the infant is stronger."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Preterm infants often have difficulty coordinating feeding. Referral to a specialist allows for targeted interventions to improve feeding skills. Skin-to-skin can also be helpful but may not be sufficient alone."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A mother of triplets is overwhelmed and expresses feelings of guilt about not being able to exclusively breastfeed. What is the MOST important aspect of your support?",
            "options": ["Insisting she continue trying to exclusively breastfeed despite her distress.", "Providing non-judgmental support and helping her explore realistic feeding goals.", "Emphasizing the superiority of breast milk over formula at all costs.", "Immediately referring her to a psychiatrist for postpartum depression."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-judgmental support and realistic goal setting are crucial. Mothers of multiples often face immense pressure, and focusing on achievable goals while validating her feelings is paramount. While postpartum depression is a concern, it is not the immediate priority without further assessment."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother with a history of postpartum depression is prescribed an SSRI. What is the BEST course of action regarding breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["Advise her to discontinue breastfeeding immediately.", "Recommend she switch to a different antidepressant with no known excretion into breast milk.", "Inform her that most SSRIs are considered compatible with breastfeeding, but monitoring the infant for side effects is important.", "Tell her the SSRI will likely increase her milk supply."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Most SSRIs are considered compatible with breastfeeding, but it's crucial to monitor the infant for any potential side effects. Discontinuation is usually not necessary, and changing medications should be done in consultation with her prescribing doctor."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "During an assessment, you observe limited tongue movement and a heart-shaped appearance of the tongue upon elevation. These findings are MOST indicative of:",
            "options": ["A normal anatomical variation.", "Ankyloglossia (tongue-tie).", "Torticollis.", "Oral thrush."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limited tongue movement and a heart-shaped tongue are classic signs of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie), which can restrict tongue function and impact breastfeeding."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A 9-month-old infant suddenly refuses to breastfeed, exhibiting crying and arching away from the breast. The mother reports no recent changes in routine or illness. What is the MOST likely explanation?",
            "options": ["The infant is ready to wean.", "The mother's milk supply has suddenly dropped.", "Breastfeeding aversion due to sensory overload or a negative association.", "The infant is experiencing a growth spurt and requires more solid foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sudden breastfeeding refusal, especially with crying and arching, is often indicative of breastfeeding aversion. This can be triggered by sensory overload, pressure to feed, or a negative experience at the breast."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "As a breastfeeding support coach, you are asked to provide medical advice outside of your scope of practice. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Provide the advice to the best of your knowledge, but with a disclaimer.", "Refer the client to an appropriate healthcare professional.", "Consult with a more experienced lactation consultant before providing any advice.", "Ignore the request and continue with your standard support."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Referring the client to an appropriate healthcare professional ensures they receive qualified medical advice and protects you from practicing outside your scope of practice."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A mother reports a history of breast augmentation with periareolar incisions. What is the MOST important consideration regarding her breastfeeding potential?",
            "options": ["Breast augmentation always prevents successful breastfeeding.", "The type of incision and any nerve damage that may have occurred during surgery.", "She will automatically have an oversupply of milk.", "She should avoid breastfeeding altogether to prevent complications."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Periareolar incisions have a higher risk of disrupting milk ducts and nerves, potentially affecting milk production. Understanding the surgical details is crucial for assessing breastfeeding potential."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client is diagnosed with mastitis and prescribed antibiotics. She is concerned about the safety of breastfeeding while taking medication. What information should you provide?",
            "options": ["Advise her to stop breastfeeding immediately to avoid passing the infection to the baby.", "Assure her that most antibiotics prescribed for mastitis are safe for breastfeeding, and continuing to breastfeed can help clear the infection.", "Tell her to pump and dump her milk while taking antibiotics.", "Suggest she switch to a different antibiotic without consulting her doctor."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most antibiotics prescribed for mastitis are compatible with breastfeeding. Continuing to breastfeed helps drain the breast and clear the infection. Cessation is generally not necessary and can worsen the condition."
