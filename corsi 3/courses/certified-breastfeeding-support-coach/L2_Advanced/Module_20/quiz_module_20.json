            "question": "The LATCH scoring system assesses which five key components of breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of nipple, Comfort, Hold", "Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of nipple, Comfort, Height", "Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of nipple, Compression, Hold", "Latch, Audible swallowing, Timing, Comfort, Hold"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "LATCH stands for Latch, Audible swallowing, Type of nipple, Comfort, and Hold. Each component is scored from 0-2, with a total possible score of 10."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary indicator of effective milk transfer during breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["Audible swallowing", "Maternal reports of breast softening after feeding", "Infrequent stool output (less than 1-2 stools per day after day 4)", "Adequate weight gain according to established growth charts"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infrequent stool output after day 4 is a potential sign of inadequate milk intake. Audible swallowing, breast softening, and adequate weight gain are all positive indicators."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother reports severe nipple pain with blanching after each feeding. Which condition is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Normal postpartum discomfort", "Thrush (yeast infection)", "Vasospasm", "Poor latch technique"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Nipple blanching followed by throbbing pain is characteristic of vasospasm, often triggered by Raynaud's phenomenon or nipple trauma."

            "options": ["5-10%", "10-15%", "15-20%", "20-25%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Brown et al. (2018) found that approximately 10-15% of postpartum women experience clinically significant symptoms of postpartum depression."

            "options": ["APGAR score", "Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)", "LATCH score", "Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (HATLFF)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The HATLFF is specifically designed to evaluate the appearance and function of the tongue and frenulum in infants."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A mother expresses concern about low milk supply. Which assessment would be MOST helpful in determining her milk production capacity?",
            "options": ["Observing infant feeding patterns", "Test weighing before and after feeding", "Assessing maternal breast anatomy", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "All three options provide valuable information. Observing feeding patterns gives insight into infant behavior, test weighing measures milk intake, and breast anatomy can reveal potential structural issues."

            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "In a case study, a mother of a 2-week-old infant scores a 12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). What action should the breastfeeding support coach take?",
            "options": ["Reassure her that these feelings are normal.", "Suggest she try herbal remedies to improve her mood.", "Refer her to a qualified mental health professional for further evaluation and support.", "Advise her to discontinue breastfeeding to reduce stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "An EPDS score of 12 indicates possible depression. Referral to a mental health professional is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "All of the listed options are indicators of a posterior tongue-tie, which often requires a careful physical assessment to diagnose."

            "question": "What is the primary purpose of assessing maternal breast anatomy during a breastfeeding consultation?",
            "options": ["To determine the mother's cup size", "To identify potential issues like inverted nipples or breast asymmetry that may affect latch", "To evaluate the mother's overall physical health", "To predict future milk supply"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing breast anatomy helps identify structural factors that could impact breastfeeding success, such as inverted nipples or insufficient glandular tissue."

            "question": "A mother reports that her baby is choking and coughing during letdown. What is the most likely cause and appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Low milk supply; encourage more frequent feeding.", "Overactive letdown; suggest feeding in a reclined position.", "Tongue-tie; refer for frenotomy.", "Nipple vasospasm; recommend warm compresses."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Choking and coughing during letdown suggests an overactive letdown. Feeding in a reclined position helps the baby manage the milk flow."
