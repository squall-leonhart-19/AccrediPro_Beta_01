            "question": "A mother is experiencing persistent nipple pain despite good latch assessment. Which of the following advanced techniques should be considered FIRST?",
            "options": ["Nipple shields", "Referral to a lactation consultant with expertise in tongue-tie assessment", "Initiating a pumping regimen to reduce direct breastfeeding", "Suggesting topical corticosteroids without further assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While nipple shields and pumping might provide temporary relief, and topical corticosteroids may be appropriate in some cases, persistent nipple pain despite a good latch assessment necessitates ruling out anatomical issues like tongue-tie. Addressing the root cause is paramount."

            "question": "A mother of twins is concerned about producing enough milk. She is currently pumping 8 times per day and breastfeeding on demand. Which of the following strategies is MOST likely to further increase her milk supply, according to current research?",
            "options": ["Adding galactagogues without addressing milk removal frequency", "Power pumping once daily for 1 hour", "Decreasing pumping sessions to allow for more rest", "Completely switching to formula feeding to preserve maternal energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Power pumping mimics cluster feeding and can effectively signal the body to produce more milk. A 2017 study in the *Journal of Human Lactation* showed significant increases in milk volume with power pumping (Meier et al., 2017)."

            "question": "A 2-week-old infant presents with projectile vomiting after most feedings. The mother reports the baby seems uncomfortable but is gaining weight adequately. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch to a hypoallergenic formula", "Implement strategies to manage reflux, such as upright positioning after feeds and smaller, more frequent feedings", "Administer an over-the-counter antacid", "Advise the mother to stop eating dairy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While allergies should be considered, initial management of reflux involves conservative measures. Upright positioning and smaller feeds are evidence-based strategies. Switching to hypoallergenic formula or eliminating dairy should only be considered after further investigation and if symptoms persist or worsen. Medication should only be administered under medical supervision."

            "question": "In supporting a mother breastfeeding a premature infant, which of the following is the MOST crucial factor to consider?",
            "options": ["Encouraging exclusive breastfeeding regardless of infant's gestational age or medical condition", "Prioritizing maternal convenience and comfort", "Ensuring the infant's ability to coordinate suck, swallow, and breathe", "Discouraging pumping to avoid nipple confusion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premature infants often have underdeveloped sucking and swallowing reflexes. Assessing and supporting the infant's ability to coordinate these functions is critical for successful breastfeeding and preventing aspiration. Exclusive breastfeeding is ideal, but must be balanced with the infant's capabilities. "

            "question": "A mother with a history of postpartum depression is struggling with breastfeeding. She reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious. What is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Advising her to stop breastfeeding immediately to reduce stress", "Encouraging her to persevere with breastfeeding regardless of her mental state", "Providing emotional support, connecting her with mental health resources, and exploring feeding options together", "Suggesting she self-medicate with herbal remedies"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maternal mental health significantly impacts breastfeeding success. Providing emotional support, connecting her with mental health resources, and exploring feeding options collaboratively is crucial. Abruptly stopping breastfeeding or pressuring her to continue can exacerbate her mental health issues."

            "question": "A mother reports recurrent plugged ducts in the same location in her breast. What advanced assessment technique should be considered to identify potential underlying causes?",
            "options": ["Recommending increased saturated fat intake to improve milk flow", "Assessing for anatomical variations in the breast, such as a tight bra or scar tissue", "Advising complete breast rest", "Suggesting the mother avoid all forms of manual breast massage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recurrent plugged ducts in the same location may indicate an anatomical issue. External pressure from bras or scar tissue from previous surgeries can impede milk flow. Addressing these underlying issues is crucial for preventing recurrence."

            "question": "Which of the following statements accurately reflects the ethical considerations for a breastfeeding support coach?",
            "options": ["It is acceptable to diagnose medical conditions and prescribe medications if within the coach's personal experience.", "Coaches should operate within their defined scope of practice and refer to appropriate healthcare professionals when necessary.", "Coaches are not responsible for maintaining client confidentiality.", "Offering financial incentives for successful breastfeeding outcomes is an ethical practice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breastfeeding support coaches must adhere to ethical guidelines, including operating within their scope of practice and referring to healthcare professionals when necessary. Diagnosing medical conditions or prescribing medications is outside the scope of practice. Confidentiality is paramount, and financial incentives can create conflicts of interest."

            "question": "A mother of triplets is determined to exclusively breastfeed. What is the MOST important factor to address in her breastfeeding plan?",
            "options": ["Discouraging tandem feeding to avoid overwhelming the mother", "Focusing solely on direct breastfeeding and avoiding pumping", "Establishing a robust pumping and feeding schedule to ensure adequate milk supply and infant weight gain", "Recommending immediate supplementation with formula to reduce maternal burden"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mothers of multiples require a structured approach to ensure adequate milk supply and infant weight gain. Establishing a pumping and feeding schedule is crucial, and supplementation may be necessary to meet the infants' needs. Tandem feeding can be efficient, but the mother's comfort and ability to manage multiple infants must be considered."

            "question": "A mother is concerned about the potential for allergies in her breastfed infant. She has a strong family history of allergies. What is the MOST appropriate advice?",
            "options": ["Advising her to eliminate all common allergens from her diet as a preventative measure", "Recommending early introduction of allergenic foods to build tolerance", "Encouraging continued breastfeeding while monitoring the infant for any signs of allergic reactions", "Switching to a hypoallergenic formula immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Current guidelines generally recommend continued breastfeeding while monitoring the infant for signs of allergic reactions. Restrictive maternal diets are not typically recommended unless there is a clear indication of an allergy in the infant. Early introduction of allergenic foods is a developing area of research and should be discussed with a pediatrician. Switching to hypoallergenic formula should only be considered if medically necessary."

            "question": "A mother is experiencing vasospasm in her nipples. Which of the following interventions is MOST likely to provide relief based on current evidence?",
            "options": ["Applying ice packs to the nipples after feeding", "Encouraging smoking to improve circulation", "Avoiding all caffeine and nicotine, and using warm compresses", "Recommending tightly fitted bras to provide support"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vasospasm is often triggered by cold temperatures and vasoconstrictors like caffeine and nicotine. Warm compresses and avoiding these substances can help alleviate symptoms. Ice packs would exacerbate the condition. Properly fitted bras are important for comfort, but tight bras can restrict circulation."
