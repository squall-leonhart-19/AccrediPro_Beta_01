            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when supporting a mother breastfeeding a premature infant?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to a 3-hour feeding schedule.", "Supplementation with formula to ensure adequate weight gain.", "Prioritizing the infant's readiness cues for feeding.", "Discouraging skin-to-skin contact to minimize infection risk."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Premature infants may have underdeveloped feeding reflexes. Prioritizing readiness cues and offering support, rather than forcing a rigid schedule, promotes successful breastfeeding. Skin-to-skin contact is generally encouraged."

        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A mother of twins expresses concern about producing enough milk. What is the MOST effective strategy to increase milk supply in this situation?",
            "options": ["Exclusive pumping every 3 hours.", "Supplementing with formula for one twin.", "Frequent and effective milk removal through breastfeeding or pumping.", "Limiting breastfeeding sessions to 10 minutes per breast."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent and effective milk removal is crucial to stimulate milk production. The body responds to demand. Supplementation may decrease the drive for milk production. Limiting breastfeeding may not provide sufficient stimulation."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "A client reports decreased milk production after breast reduction surgery. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
            "options": ["Increased prolactin levels.", "Damage to milk ducts or nerves.", "Overstimulation of the let-down reflex.", "Increased breast tissue volume."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breast reduction surgery can sometimes damage milk ducts or nerves, leading to decreased milk production. Prolactin levels are not typically affected. Overstimulation is unlikely, and tissue volume is reduced, not increased."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Which maternal health condition is MOST likely to require careful monitoring of medication compatibility with breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["Gestational diabetes.", "Hypertension.", "Hypothyroidism.", "Postpartum depression."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Certain medications used to treat postpartum depression can pass into breast milk and potentially affect the infant. While the other conditions require management, their medications are generally safer for breastfeeding."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "An infant with Down syndrome is having difficulty latching. What is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Suggest immediate formula supplementation.", "Refer to a lactation consultant experienced with infants with special needs.", "Advise the mother to pump exclusively.", "Recommend surgical correction of the infant's tongue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infants with Down syndrome may have anatomical differences that affect latch. A lactation consultant experienced with special needs infants can provide tailored support. Supplementation and pumping are not the first line of action, and surgery is not typically indicated for latch difficulties."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A mother who previously breastfed her child 5 years ago wishes to relactate to breastfeed her adopted infant. What is the MOST important factor in successfully inducing lactation?",
            "options": ["A history of successful breastfeeding.", "Use of galactagogues only.", "Consistent breast stimulation through pumping or nursing.", "The infant's age."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent breast stimulation is essential to stimulate milk production. While a history of breastfeeding can be helpful, it is not the most critical factor. Galactagogues can assist, but are not a replacement for stimulation. The infant's age is less important than the consistency of stimulation."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A mother is returning to work and wants to maintain her milk supply. What is the MINIMUM recommended frequency for pumping at work?",
            "options": ["Once every 6 hours.", "Once every 2-3 hours.", "Once every 8 hours.", "Only when breasts feel full."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "To maintain milk supply, it's recommended to pump every 2-3 hours at work to mimic the infant's feeding schedule. Waiting longer can lead to decreased milk production. Pumping only when full is not frequent enough."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "A breastfeeding mother experiences persistent nipple pain despite a good latch. What is the NEXT step in assessing the cause of the pain?",
            "options": ["Recommend immediate weaning.", "Prescribe a topical steroid cream.", "Assess for nipple damage, infection (e.g., thrush), or vasospasm.", "Assume the pain is normal and advise her to continue breastfeeding."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent nipple pain can indicate underlying issues. Assessing for nipple damage, infection (like thrush), or vasospasm is critical before other interventions. Weaning is not the first step. Steroids should only be used when indicated and after other causes have been ruled out."

        {
            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A mother with mastitis presents with fever, localized breast pain, and redness. What is the MOST appropriate initial treatment?",
            "options": ["Immediate cessation of breastfeeding on the affected side.", "Application of ice packs only.", "Frequent breastfeeding or pumping, and antibiotics if symptoms don't improve within 24 hours.", "Surgical drainage of the affected area."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastitis is best treated with frequent milk removal to prevent milk stasis. Antibiotics are indicated if symptoms don't improve within 24 hours. Cessation of breastfeeding is generally not recommended. Ice packs can provide comfort, but are not a primary treatment. Surgical drainage is only necessary in rare cases."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to a 2021 study in the Journal of Human Lactation, mothers who received peer support for breastfeeding after returning to work were how much more likely to continue breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum, compared to those who did not receive peer support?",
            "options": ["10% more likely", "25% more likely", "40% more likely", "60% more likely"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 2021 study in the Journal of Human Lactation found that mothers who received peer support for breastfeeding after returning to work were 60% more likely to continue breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum, highlighting the significant impact of peer support in achieving breastfeeding goals."
