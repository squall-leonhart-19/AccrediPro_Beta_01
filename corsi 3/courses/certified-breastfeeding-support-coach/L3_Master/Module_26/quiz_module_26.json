            "explanation": "Breastfeeding rates and disparities directly indicate the need for support and highlight specific populations that may require targeted interventions.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Measuring breastfeeding rates at key intervals provides a direct indication of the program's impact on breastfeeding outcomes. Comparing these rates to baseline data or a control group helps determine the program's effectiveness. As an example, the Reach Out and Read program tracks literacy outcomes, and similar tracking is needed here."
