            "question": "A postpartum mother is experiencing intrusive thoughts of harming her baby. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate first step?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to try relaxation techniques.", "Assure her that these thoughts are normal and will pass.", "Immediately contact emergency services and report potential harm.", "Refer her to a mental health professional specializing in postpartum mental health."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While relaxation techniques may be helpful, and reassurance can be supportive, intrusive thoughts of harm require immediate assessment by a mental health professional. Emergency services are only required if there is an immediate risk. A specialist referral is the most appropriate first step."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "According to the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine protocol, what is the preferred method for assessing the safety of breastfeeding when a mother is taking a prescribed medication?",
            "options": ["Rely on the prescribing physician's assurance of safety.", "Consulting LactMed and/or a qualified lactation consultant or pharmacist specializing in medications and breastfeeding.", "Assuming that if the medication is available over-the-counter, it is safe.", "Instructing the mother to pump and dump for 24 hours after each dose."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LactMed and consultation with qualified professionals are the gold standard for assessing medication safety during breastfeeding. Physician assurances alone are insufficient, over-the-counter availability doesn't guarantee safety, and 'pump and dump' is often unnecessary and can disrupt breastfeeding."

            "question": "A mother who is a recovering opioid addict expresses a strong desire to breastfeed. She is currently maintained on methadone. What guidance should you provide?",
            "options": ["Discourage breastfeeding due to the risk of infant exposure to methadone.", "Support breastfeeding, as methadone levels in breast milk are generally low and considered safe under medical supervision.", "Advise her to switch to formula feeding to avoid any potential risks.", "Recommend breastfeeding only if she can completely wean off methadone."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breastfeeding is generally considered safe for mothers maintained on stable doses of methadone under medical supervision. The benefits of breastfeeding often outweigh the risks of low-level methadone exposure. Sudden weaning or formula feeding may be more detrimental."

            "question": "A premature infant born at 32 weeks gestation is struggling to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing. What is the MOST appropriate initial feeding strategy?",
            "options": ["Encourage direct breastfeeding every 2 hours.", "Initiate bolus gavage feeding to conserve the infant's energy.", "Begin with small, frequent cup feedings.", "Start with non-nutritive sucking at the breast followed by gavage feeding or expressed breast milk via bottle."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Non-nutritive sucking at the breast can help stimulate milk production and promote oral motor development. Gavage feeding ensures adequate nutrition without exhausting the infant. Direct breastfeeding and cup feeding are often too challenging initially for a 32-week infant."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A mother with mastitis is experiencing severe pain and fever despite antibiotic treatment for 48 hours. What is the next most appropriate step?",
            "options": ["Advise her to stop breastfeeding on the affected side.", "Recommend increasing the antibiotic dosage.", "Refer her back to her healthcare provider to rule out an abscess or antibiotic-resistant infection.", "Suggest applying warm compresses and massaging the affected area more vigorously."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent mastitis symptoms despite antibiotic treatment warrant further medical evaluation to rule out complications like abscess formation or antibiotic resistance. Simply increasing the dosage or continuing home remedies may delay appropriate treatment."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A non-gestational mother is attempting induced lactation to breastfeed her adopted infant. After several weeks of using the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, she is only producing small amounts of colostrum. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Advise her to discontinue the protocol as it is unlikely to be successful.", "Encourage her to continue the protocol, emphasizing that any amount of breast milk is beneficial, and supplement with donor milk or formula as needed.", "Suggest she try a different galactagogue.", "Recommend she focus on bottle feeding to establish a strong bond with the baby."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Induced lactation can be challenging, and milk production varies. Continuing the protocol while supplementing ensures the infant receives adequate nutrition and allows the mother to provide whatever breast milk she can produce, which offers immunological and emotional benefits."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A woman who underwent a breast reduction surgery several years ago is now pregnant and wants to breastfeed. What is the MOST important factor to assess regarding her potential for successful lactation?",
            "options": ["The type of incision used during the surgery.", "The size of her breasts before the surgery.", "Whether she experienced any complications during the surgery.", "Whether milk ducts and nerves were significantly damaged or severed during the procedure."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The extent of damage to milk ducts and nerves during breast reduction surgery is the primary determinant of breastfeeding success. While incision type can offer clues, the functional integrity of the milk-producing structures is most critical."

            "question": "A mother whose infant was stillborn at 38 weeks gestation expresses a desire to suppress lactation. Which of the following is the LEAST appropriate recommendation?",
            "options": ["Wearing a supportive bra.", "Applying ice packs to the breasts.", "Taking a diuretic medication.", "Using pain relievers as needed for discomfort."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diuretics are not recommended for lactation suppression and can be harmful. Supportive bras, ice packs, and pain relievers are appropriate comfort measures. Avoiding nipple stimulation is also crucial."

            "question": "As a breastfeeding support coach, you are approached by a client who is considering using cannabis to manage her postpartum anxiety. What is your ethical responsibility?",
            "options": ["To provide her with information on the potential benefits and risks of cannabis use during breastfeeding, citing available research.", "To recommend specific cannabis products that are considered safe for breastfeeding mothers.", "To discourage her from using cannabis and report her to child protective services.", "To clearly explain that you cannot provide medical advice and recommend that she discuss this with her healthcare provider, while also providing evidence-based information on the potential risks of cannabis use during lactation."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "As a breastfeeding support coach, providing medical advice is outside your scope of practice. It is crucial to refer the client to her healthcare provider for medical guidance while offering evidence-based information on potential risks, and avoid making recommendations that could be interpreted as medical advice."

            "question": "A client confides in you that she is experiencing severe postpartum depression and has thoughts of self-harm. She asks you to keep this information confidential. What is your ethical and legal obligation?",
            "options": ["To maintain confidentiality as she requested, as breaching her trust could worsen her condition.", "To encourage her to seek help and offer resources, but respect her decision if she declines.", "To break confidentiality and immediately report her situation to a mental health professional or crisis hotline due to the risk of self-harm.", "To inform her family members about her condition so they can provide support."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "When a client expresses suicidal ideation or poses a danger to themselves or others, confidentiality must be breached. This is a critical ethical and legal obligation to ensure the client's safety and well-being. Reporting to a mental health professional or crisis hotline allows for immediate intervention and support."
