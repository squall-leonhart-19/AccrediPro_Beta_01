            "options": ["Simply listening to a caregiver's concerns.", "Actively listening, validating, and respecting a caregiver's experiences and perspective.", "Providing immediate solutions to a caregiver's problems.", "Documenting caregiver complaints for administrative purposes."],

            "explanation": "Hearing & Honoring goes beyond simple listening; it encompasses active engagement, validation, and respect for the caregiver's unique situation and perspective."

            "question": "A caregiver, Sarah, expresses frustration, stating, 'I feel like I'm failing my mother.' Which active listening technique would be MOST appropriate to use FIRST?",
            "options": ["Offering advice on time management strategies.", "Reflecting her feelings by saying, 'It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and inadequate in your caregiving role.'", "Changing the subject to a more positive topic.", "Suggesting she consider placing her mother in a nursing home."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflecting feelings acknowledges the caregiver's emotional state and demonstrates that you are truly hearing and understanding their experience. This should precede advice-giving."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "What is the KEY difference between empathy and sympathy in the context of caregiver support?",
            "options": ["Empathy involves feeling sorry for the caregiver, while sympathy involves understanding their feelings.", "Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of the caregiver, while sympathy involves feeling pity or sorrow for them.", "Empathy is more effective than sympathy in building rapport with caregivers.", "There is no significant difference between empathy and sympathy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A caregiver is consistently late for support group meetings and avoids eye contact. What might this non-verbal communication indicate?",
            "options": ["The caregiver is intentionally being disrespectful.", "The caregiver may be experiencing burnout, stress, or discomfort.", "The caregiver is simply disorganized.", "The caregiver is not interested in receiving support."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validation involves acknowledging and affirming the caregiver's feelings and experiences as valid and understandable, even if you don't personally agree with them. Saying 'I understand exactly how you feel' can minimize their unique experience."
