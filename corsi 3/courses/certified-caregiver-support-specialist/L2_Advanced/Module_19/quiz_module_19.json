            "question": "What is the primary goal of evidence-based practice (EBP) in caregiver support?",
            "options": ["To reduce costs associated with caregiver programs.", "To implement interventions based on the best available research evidence.", "To standardize caregiver support services across all organizations.", "To rely solely on anecdotal evidence and personal experience."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice aims to improve outcomes for caregivers by using interventions that have been proven effective through rigorous research."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which of the following databases is MOST suitable for finding systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to caregiver interventions?",
            "options": ["PubMed", "Google Scholar", "Cochrane Library", "PsycINFO"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cochrane Library is specifically designed to provide access to systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which are high-level summaries of research evidence."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A researcher is studying the impact of a new online support group for dementia caregivers. They randomly assign caregivers to either the online support group or a waitlist control group. What type of research methodology is being used?",
            "options": ["Qualitative study", "Cross-sectional study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Case study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions because they use randomization to minimize bias and establish causality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "When critically appraising a research article, what does 'internal validity' primarily refer to?",
            "options": ["The generalizability of the findings to other populations.", "The accuracy of the statistical analyses.", "The extent to which the study design minimizes bias and allows for causal inferences.", "The relevance of the research question to caregiver support."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal validity refers to the confidence that the observed effects are truly due to the intervention and not to other factors that could have influenced the results."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "According to a 2023 meta-analysis by Smith et al., mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) showed a statistically significant reduction in caregiver stress (d = -0.45, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.28]). What does the effect size (d = -0.45) indicate?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness-based interventions are not effective for reducing caregiver stress.", "Mindfulness-based interventions have a large positive effect on caregiver stress.", "Mindfulness-based interventions have a small to moderate negative effect on caregiver stress.", "The effect of mindfulness-based interventions on caregiver stress is negligible."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An effect size of -0.45 indicates a small to moderate negative effect, suggesting that MBIs are associated with a reduction in caregiver stress. The negative sign indicates a decrease in stress."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A caregiver support program implemented a new evidence-based respite care service. After six months, they collect data on caregiver stress levels and satisfaction with the service. What type of evaluation is being conducted?",
            "options": ["Needs assessment", "Formative evaluation", "Summative evaluation", "Process evaluation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Summative evaluation assesses the overall effectiveness and outcomes of a program or intervention after it has been implemented."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which ethical principle is MOST directly violated when researchers fail to obtain informed consent from caregivers participating in a study?",
            "options": ["Justice", "Beneficence", "Respect for persons", "Non-maleficence"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Respect for persons emphasizes the autonomy of individuals and requires that they be fully informed about the research and voluntarily agree to participate."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "You are advocating for increased funding for evidence-based caregiver support programs. Which of the following arguments is MOST likely to be persuasive to policymakers?",
            "options": ["Highlighting personal stories of caregivers in need.", "Presenting data demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of evidence-based programs.", "Emphasizing the moral obligation to support caregivers.", "Focusing on the emotional toll of caregiving."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Policymakers are often influenced by data and evidence that demonstrate the economic benefits and return on investment of programs."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Support groups have been shown to be effective in reducing isolation and improving coping skills for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This aligns with evidence-based practices."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A caregiver support agency wants to implement a new evidence-based intervention but lacks the resources for a full-scale randomized controlled trial. What is a feasible alternative approach to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness?",
            "options": ["Rely on anecdotal feedback from caregivers.", "Conduct a small pilot study with pre- and post-intervention measures.", "Implement the intervention without any evaluation.", "Compare the intervention to a completely unrelated program."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A pilot study can provide preliminary data on the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness, allowing the agency to make informed decisions about further implementation and evaluation."
