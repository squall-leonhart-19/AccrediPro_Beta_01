            "options": ["Caregivers report feeling less stressed.", "Caregivers demonstrate improved coping mechanisms.", "A 20% decrease in caregiver scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory within 6 months.", "Caregivers attend support group meetings regularly."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 20% decrease in scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory is the most measurable outcome, as it provides a specific, quantifiable target for program success. The other options are less precise."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A logic model provides a visual representation of the program's theory of change, illustrating how inputs lead to activities, which in turn produce outputs and ultimately achieve desired outcomes."

            "options": ["Hiring a large number of staff to provide individual counseling.", "Partnering with existing community organizations to leverage their resources and expertise.", "Investing in expensive technology and equipment.", "Developing all program materials and resources in-house."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Partnering with existing community organizations allows the program to leverage existing resources, infrastructure, and expertise, reducing costs and increasing reach."

            "options": ["Focusing solely on short-term funding opportunities.", "Diversifying funding sources to reduce reliance on any single source.", "Ignoring the need for ongoing program evaluation.", "Relying entirely on volunteer staff."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diversifying funding sources is crucial for long-term sustainability, as it reduces the risk of program closure due to the loss of a single funding stream."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "What is the MOST important consideration when developing implementation strategies for a caregiver support program?",
            "options": ["Minimizing costs at all costs.", "Ensuring that the program is culturally sensitive and accessible to the target population.", "Implementing the program as quickly as possible.", "Ignoring potential barriers to participation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural sensitivity and accessibility are paramount to ensuring that the program effectively reaches and serves the target population. Ignoring these factors can lead to low participation rates and ineffective outcomes."

            "options": ["Immediately scaling up the intervention to reach a larger population.", "Conducting a process evaluation to assess program fidelity and implementation.", "Waiting several years to assess long-term outcomes.", "Ignoring any negative feedback from participants."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A process evaluation assesses whether the program was implemented as intended and identifies any challenges or barriers to implementation. This is crucial for understanding why the program may or may not have achieved its desired outcomes. Program fidelity is key."
