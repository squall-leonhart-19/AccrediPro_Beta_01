            "question": "In somatic therapy supervision, what is the primary goal of exploring the supervisee's own embodied experience in relation to their clients?",
            "options": ["To diagnose the supervisee's personal somatic issues.", "To enhance the supervisee's self-awareness and understanding of transference/countertransference dynamics.", "To encourage the supervisee to use their own somatic techniques on clients.", "To minimize the supervisee's emotional involvement with clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring the supervisee's embodied experience helps them understand how their own somatic responses might be influencing their work with clients, promoting more effective and ethical practice."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A supervisee consistently avoids exploring their own bodily sensations during sessions, potentially hindering their ability to attune to clients. What would be the MOST appropriate initial step for the supervisor?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the potential for intense emotional and physical release in TRE, it's critical to ensure the supervisee has a strong understanding of trauma and can manage client dysregulation."
