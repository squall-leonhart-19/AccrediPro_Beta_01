            "question": "In somatic therapy for trauma-related dissociation, which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Encouraging detailed recall of traumatic events.", "Grounding and stabilization techniques to enhance present moment awareness.", "Deep abreaction to release pent-up emotions.", "Exploring past life regressions to understand the root cause of trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding and stabilization are crucial first steps in working with dissociation to build safety and present moment awareness before addressing trauma directly. As discussed in L1, this approach helps clients regulate and prevent re-traumatization."

        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports catastrophizing thoughts (e.g., “This pain will never end”). Which somatic technique would be MOST effective in addressing this cognitive pattern?",
            "options": ["Guided imagery focusing on pain reduction.", "Body scan meditation to increase awareness without judgment.", "Vigorous physical exercise to distract from the pain.", "Ignoring the client's cognitive statements and focusing solely on physical sensations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body scan meditation, as covered in L2, cultivates mindful awareness of sensations without judgment, which can help clients detach from catastrophizing thoughts and reduce their impact. This aligns with the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) often integrated with somatic approaches."

            "question": "A pregnant client in her third trimester is experiencing anxiety and hypervigilance. Which somatic intervention is MOST suitable for promoting relaxation and emotional regulation?",
            "options": ["Diaphragmatic breathing exercises.", "Intense aerobic exercise.", "Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT).", "Confronting fears about childbirth directly through exposure therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing is a safe and effective technique for pregnant clients to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation, as highlighted in L3. Intense exercise is contraindicated, and trauma-focused therapies may be too activating at this stage."

            "question": "Which statement BEST reflects the role of interoceptive awareness in somatic therapy for eating disorders?",
            "options": ["It is irrelevant as eating disorders are primarily cognitive in nature.", "It helps clients reconnect with bodily cues of hunger and fullness, promoting intuitive eating.", "It encourages clients to ignore bodily sensations to avoid triggering anxiety.", "It focuses solely on external appearance and body image."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive awareness, as discussed in L4, is vital for helping clients with eating disorders reconnect with internal cues of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction, which supports the development of a healthier relationship with food and their bodies. This contrasts with cognitive distortions often present in eating disorders."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle movement exercises like Tai Chi or Feldenkrais, as covered in L5, are ideal for older adults with arthritis as they promote flexibility, balance, and pain reduction without placing excessive stress on joints. These approaches are often modified to accommodate individual limitations."

            "options": ["To completely eliminate all cravings.", "To help clients understand and manage the physical and emotional sensations associated with craving, reducing relapse risk.", "To encourage clients to suppress cravings through willpower alone.", "To avoid any discussion of cravings to prevent triggering relapse."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the 'felt sense' of craving, as discussed in L6, empowers clients to recognize and manage the physical and emotional components of craving, allowing them to make conscious choices and reduce the likelihood of relapse. This approach emphasizes self-regulation rather than suppression."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Progressive muscle relaxation, as covered in L7, helps reduce physical tension associated with performance anxiety, allowing the musician to access a more relaxed and focused state. This technique promotes embodiment and presence rather than dissociation."

            "question": "A client is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression but reports feeling disconnected from their emotions. How could somatic therapy be integrated to enhance their treatment?",
            "options": ["By replacing CBT entirely with somatic techniques.", "By using somatic experiencing to help the client access and process underlying emotions related to their depression.", "By focusing solely on physical symptoms and ignoring cognitive processes.", "By avoiding any discussion of emotions to prevent triggering negative thoughts."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic experiencing, as discussed in L8, can complement CBT by helping clients access and process emotions that may be difficult to reach through cognitive approaches alone. This integration addresses both cognitive and emotional aspects of depression for a more holistic treatment."

            "question": "A client with a history of complex trauma presents with chronic pelvic pain and reports feeling 'frozen' in their body. Which somatic intervention would be LEAST appropriate as an initial approach?",
            "options": ["Gentle rocking movements to promote relaxation.", "Titration and pendulation to gradually explore sensations without overwhelming the client.", "Encouraging the client to immediately engage in intense emotional release work related to the trauma.", "Grounding exercises to establish a sense of safety and present moment awareness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intense emotional release work is generally contraindicated as an initial approach for clients with complex trauma, as it can be overwhelming and potentially re-traumatizing. Titration and pendulation, as discussed in L1, are more gentle and gradual methods for exploring sensations safely."
