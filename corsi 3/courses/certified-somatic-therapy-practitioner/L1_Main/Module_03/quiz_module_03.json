            "question": "According to research presented by Dr. Kristin Neff, which of the following is NOT a core component of self-compassion?",
            "options": ["Self-kindness", "Common humanity", "Mindfulness", "Self-criticism"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Dr. Neff identifies self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness as the three core components of self-compassion. Self-criticism is the opposite of self-compassion."

        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client expresses feeling intense shame about their body size, stating, \"I'm disgusted with myself.\" Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial somatic intervention?",
            "options": ["Challenging their cognitive distortions about body image.", "Guiding them through a grounding exercise to connect with the present moment.", "Encouraging them to engage in vigorous physical activity.", "Suggesting a weight-loss program."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises help to regulate the nervous system and bring the client back to the present moment, creating a safe space to explore difficult emotions like shame. Challenging cognitions or suggesting physical activity without addressing the underlying shame may be counterproductive."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST reflects the concept of 'common humanity' in the context of self-compassion?",
            "options": ["Recognizing that suffering is a personal weakness.", "Understanding that everyone experiences difficulties and imperfections.", "Comparing one's struggles to those of others to gain perspective.", "Isolating oneself from others to avoid judgment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Common humanity involves recognizing that suffering and imperfection are inherent aspects of the human experience, fostering a sense of connection and shared experience."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing flashbacks and physical tension when attempting to practice body scan meditations. What is the MOST appropriate modification to the practice?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to push through the discomfort to achieve relaxation.", "Suggest they focus on a neutral or pleasant sensation, such as the feeling of their feet on the floor.", "Advise them to avoid body scan meditations altogether.", "Instruct them to visualize their body as perfect and healthy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When working with trauma, it's crucial to prioritize safety and regulation. Focusing on a neutral or pleasant sensation can help the client stay grounded and avoid triggering traumatic memories. Pushing through discomfort or visualizing an idealized body image can be harmful."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of reframing inner dialogue with the language of compassion?",
            "options": ["From \"I'm such a failure\" to \"I made a mistake, but I can learn from it.\"", "From \"I hate my body\" to \"I need to work harder to change my body.\"", "From \"I'm not good enough\" to \"I'll never be good enough.\"", "From \"I'm so lazy\" to \"I just need to push myself harder.\""],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reframing inner dialogue involves replacing self-critical and judgmental thoughts with more compassionate and understanding ones. \"I made a mistake, but I can learn from it\" acknowledges the mistake while offering self-compassion and a growth mindset."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which of the following embodied self-soothing techniques is MOST appropriate for a client experiencing acute anxiety?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation.", "Vigorous aerobic exercise.", "Tapping (Emotional Freedom Techniques).", "Prolonged exposure therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tapping (EFT) is a gentle and accessible technique that can quickly reduce anxiety by stimulating acupressure points and calming the nervous system. Progressive muscle relaxation may take too long, vigorous exercise can be overstimulating, and prolonged exposure is not appropriate for acute anxiety."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client states, \"I know I should accept my body, but I just can't. It feels impossible.\" What is the MOST appropriate response?",
            "options": ["\"You just need to change your mindset and be more positive.\"", "\"I understand. Body acceptance is a process, and it's okay to have resistance. Let's explore what makes it feel impossible.\"", "\"You're being irrational. Your body is fine.\"", "\"If you don't accept your body, you'll never be happy.\""],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the client's resistance and validating their feelings is crucial. Exploring the underlying reasons for their resistance can help to address the barriers to body acceptance. The other options are dismissive or invalidating."

            "question": "In the context of somatic therapy, how can a therapist BEST integrate the 'Befriend the Body' principle?",
            "options": ["By focusing solely on cognitive restructuring techniques.", "By encouraging clients to ignore their bodily sensations.", "By helping clients develop a more compassionate and accepting relationship with their bodies through somatic awareness and practices.", "By prescribing specific diets and exercise routines."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating 'Befriend the Body' involves using somatic techniques to cultivate a more compassionate and accepting relationship with the body. This includes increasing body awareness, exploring bodily sensations, and using practices that promote self-compassion and regulation. Focusing solely on cognition, ignoring bodily sensations, or prescribing diets are not aligned with this principle."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 35-year-old client, reports a history of childhood emotional neglect and struggles with chronic pain. She often dissociates from her body when experiencing emotional distress. Which of the following somatic interventions would be MOST appropriate to begin with?",
            "options": ["Intense breathwork exercises to release trapped emotions.", "Gentle grounding exercises and body awareness practices to help her reconnect with her body in a safe way.", "Encouraging her to confront the traumatic memories directly.", "Suggesting she push through the pain to build resilience."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's history of trauma and dissociation, starting with gentle grounding and body awareness practices is crucial to establish safety and regulation. Intense breathwork or direct confrontation of trauma could be overwhelming and retraumatizing."

            "question": "According to research on interoception, which of the following statements is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["Interoceptive awareness is solely determined by genetic factors.", "Increased interoceptive awareness is always beneficial, regardless of individual history.", "Interoceptive awareness can be influenced by trauma and attachment experiences.", "Interoception only relates to the perception of pain signals."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that interoceptive awareness, the ability to perceive internal bodily signals, can be significantly impacted by trauma and early attachment experiences. These experiences can shape how individuals relate to and interpret their bodily sensations."
