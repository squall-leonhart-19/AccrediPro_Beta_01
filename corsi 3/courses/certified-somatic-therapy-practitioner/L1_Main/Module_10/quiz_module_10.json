            "question": "Which breathwork technique, when performed correctly, is MOST likely to directly stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting a sense of calm and relaxation?",
            "options": ["Kapalabhati breathing", "Box breathing (Sama Vritti)", "Bhastrika breathing", "Ujjayi breathing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Box breathing, with its equal inhale, hold, exhale, and hold phases, is known to balance the nervous system and stimulate the parasympathetic response, promoting relaxation. Studies have shown that controlled breathing techniques like box breathing can significantly reduce heart rate and blood pressure."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A client reports difficulty sensing their body's internal cues (e.g., hunger, temperature). Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate to enhance their <span class=\"highlight\">interoceptive awareness</span>?",
            "options": ["Vigorous exercise", "Mindful movement practices like Yoga or Tai Chi", "Watching emotionally charged movies", "Engaging in competitive sports"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindful movement practices emphasize present moment awareness of bodily sensations, which is crucial for developing interoception. Vigorous exercise or emotionally charged movies can be overwhelming and counterproductive for someone with limited interoceptive awareness."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "When working with subtle energy, a practitioner notices a client consistently holding tension in their shoulders and neck. Using an <span class=\"highlight\">energy awareness</span> approach, what might this tension indicate?",
            "options": ["A physical ailment requiring medical attention", "A blockage or stagnation of energy flow related to stress or suppressed emotions", "An indication that the client is cold", "A sign of good posture"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In energy awareness practices, physical tension is often interpreted as a manifestation of blocked or stagnant energy, frequently linked to unresolved emotions or chronic stress. It's important to rule out physical ailments, but the energy perspective offers an additional layer of understanding."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In <span class=\"highlight\">Somatic Experiencing</span>, what is the PRIMARY purpose of <span class=\"highlight\">titration</span>?",
            "options": ["To overwhelm the client with the traumatic memory", "To gradually expose the client to small, manageable aspects of the traumatic event", "To completely avoid any discussion of the traumatic event", "To force the client to confront their fears directly"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves breaking down the traumatic experience into small, manageable pieces that the client can process without becoming overwhelmed. This gradual approach allows the nervous system to regulate and integrate the experience safely."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "According to <span class=\"highlight\">Polyvagal Theory</span>, which branch of the vagus nerve is associated with social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal complex", "Ventral vagal complex", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Spinal accessory nerve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal complex is responsible for social engagement, connection, and feelings of safety. Activating this branch allows for healthy communication and emotional regulation. The dorsal vagal complex is associated with immobilization and shutdown."

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "A client consistently intellectualizes and avoids feeling their emotions during a somatic therapy session. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["A sign of progress", "A defense mechanism", "Effective emotional regulation", "An indication of malingering"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intellectualization is a common defense mechanism where individuals use excessive thinking and analysis to avoid experiencing uncomfortable emotions. It can be a sign that the client is resisting the somatic process."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "Which of the following somatic techniques is MOST appropriate for helping a client experiencing acute <span class=\"highlight\">grief</span> access and process their sadness?",
            "options": ["Rapid eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)", "Pendulation between sensations of grief and moments of comfort or neutrality", "Cognitive restructuring", "Exposure therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation allows the client to gently move between the overwhelming sensations of grief and moments of relative calm, supporting the nervous system's capacity to process the emotion without becoming dysregulated. EMDR may be useful later, but not typically in the acute phase."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A somatic therapist is working with a client who is also seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist (CBT). How can the somatic therapist BEST integrate their approach with the CBT?",
            "options": ["By directly challenging the client's cognitive distortions", "By focusing solely on physical sensations and ignoring the client's thoughts", "By using somatic techniques to help the client access and process the emotions underlying their cognitive patterns", "By advising the client to discontinue CBT"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic therapy can complement CBT by helping clients connect with and process the emotions that drive their thoughts and behaviors. This integration can lead to deeper and more lasting change."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to tremble uncontrollably. According to Somatic Experiencing principles, what is the MOST appropriate initial response from the therapist?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and refer the client to a medical doctor", "Encourage the client to suppress the trembling to regain control", "Acknowledge the trembling and allow it to continue, creating a safe space for the nervous system to discharge the energy", "Distract the client with a different topic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trembling is often a sign of the nervous system releasing pent-up energy. By creating a safe and supportive environment, the therapist allows the client's body to complete its natural process of discharge. Suppressing the trembling could interrupt this process."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'stuck' and unable to move forward in their life after experiencing a significant loss. Which somatic intervention might be MOST helpful in addressing this sense of stagnation?",
            "options": ["Engaging in vigorous aerobic exercise", "Exploring gentle movements and postures that promote a sense of grounding and connection to the body", "Prescribing antidepressant medication", "Encouraging the client to avoid thinking about the loss"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle movement and grounding exercises can help the client reconnect with their body and release the physical tension associated with grief and loss. This can promote a sense of movement and facilitate the processing of emotions."
