            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic countertransference provides valuable information about the client's process. Acknowledging, exploring, and processing it (preferably with a supervisor) allows the therapist to understand and address it without projecting onto the client."

            "question": "In case conceptualization, what is the PRIMARY benefit of integrating somatic information with traditional psychological assessments?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
