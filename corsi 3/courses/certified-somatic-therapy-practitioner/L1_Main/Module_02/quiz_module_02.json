            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the 'somatic narrative' as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": ["A linear account of a client's life events.", "The body's unique, embodied history and experiences, expressed through sensation, posture, and movement.", "A therapist's interpretation of a client's nonverbal communication.", "A purely physiological explanation of physical symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The somatic narrative encompasses the body's accumulated experiences, shaping how a person perceives and interacts with the world. It's more than just physical; it's the embodied story."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to research presented in Lesson 2, what is the relationship between sensory awareness and emotional regulation?",
            "options": ["Increased sensory awareness always leads to improved emotional regulation.", "Sensory awareness and emotional regulation are unrelated.", "Developing sensory awareness can enhance emotional regulation skills by providing access to embodied emotional information.", "Emotional regulation determines sensory perception."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultivating sensory awareness allows individuals to recognize and understand the physiological components of their emotions, providing opportunities for more effective regulation. As discussed, interoception plays a key role here."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "In Lesson 3, we discussed postural patterns. A client consistently presents with rounded shoulders and a collapsed chest. According to somatic principles, what emotional state might this posture suggest?",
            "options": ["Confidence and assertiveness.", "Openness and vulnerability.", "Shame and withdrawal.", "Excitement and anticipation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rounded shoulders and a collapsed chest often correlate with feelings of shame, sadness, or a desire to protect oneself from perceived threats. This is a common postural manifestation of emotional distress."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Lesson 4 detailed the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). Which branch of the ANS is primarily associated with the 'fight or flight' response?",
            "options": ["Parasympathetic Nervous System.", "Sympathetic Nervous System.", "Enteric Nervous System.", "Vagus Nerve."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sympathetic Nervous System activates the body's stress response, preparing it to either confront or escape a perceived danger. This involves increased heart rate, blood pressure, and adrenaline release."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client with an anxious-preoccupied attachment style, as described in Lesson 5, might exhibit which of the following embodied relational patterns?",
            "options": ["Difficulty expressing needs and emotions.", "A tendency to avoid physical contact.", "Clinginess and a fear of abandonment.", "Emotional regulation and a sense of self-sufficiency."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anxious-preoccupied attachment is characterized by a strong desire for closeness and a fear of rejection. This can manifest as clinginess, reassurance-seeking, and heightened emotional reactivity in relationships."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "In Lesson 6, we explore 'movement as metaphor.' If a client repeatedly clenches their fists during a session, what might this embodied expression symbolize?",
            "options": ["Joy and excitement.", "Peace and tranquility.", "Anger, frustration, or a desire for control.", "Relaxation and openness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clenched fists often represent suppressed anger, frustration, or a feeling of being restricted. Exploring the context of this movement can reveal underlying emotional experiences."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to the principles outlined in Lesson 7, how can negative body image impact self-perception?",
            "options": ["It has no impact on self-perception.", "It can lead to increased self-esteem and confidence.", "It can contribute to feelings of shame, anxiety, and low self-worth, distorting one's overall sense of self.", "It only affects physical health, not mental health."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Negative body image can significantly impact self-perception, leading to a distorted view of oneself and contributing to a range of psychological and emotional challenges. As discussed, cultural norms often play a role in perpetuating negative body image."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing chronic back pain after a car accident. Utilizing somatic mapping, a therapist might explore:",
            "options": ["Only the biomechanical factors contributing to the pain.", "The client's emotional experiences and beliefs related to the accident and the pain.", "Exclusively prescribing pain medication.", "Ignoring the client's emotional state."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic mapping considers the interconnectedness of the mind and body. Exploring the client's emotional and psychological responses to the trauma is crucial for understanding and addressing the chronic pain."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "What is a critical ethical consideration when integrating somatic mapping into clinical practice, as emphasized in Lesson 8?",
            "options": ["Encouraging clients to immediately confront traumatic memories without proper preparation.", "Staying within one's scope of practice and seeking appropriate supervision or referral when necessary.", "Assuming that all physical symptoms have a psychological origin.", "Pressuring clients to engage in somatic techniques they are uncomfortable with."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice in somatic therapy requires clinicians to be aware of their limitations, obtain informed consent, and prioritize client safety and well-being. Seeking supervision and referral is essential when working with complex trauma."

            "question": "In a case study presented in Lesson 8, a client named Sarah, who experienced childhood trauma, demonstrated increased vagal tone and emotional regulation after several sessions of somatic experiencing. What does increased vagal tone typically indicate?",
            "options": ["Increased anxiety and hyperarousal.", "Improved capacity for relaxation, social engagement, and emotional resilience.", "Decreased heart rate variability.", "A heightened stress response."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased vagal tone is associated with a greater ability to regulate emotions, connect with others, and cope with stress. It reflects a more balanced and adaptive nervous system."
