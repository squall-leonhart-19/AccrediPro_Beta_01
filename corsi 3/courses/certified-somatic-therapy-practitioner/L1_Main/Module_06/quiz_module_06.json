            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of integration in the context of somatic therapy?",
            "options": ["Simply recalling traumatic memories.", "A cognitive understanding of past events.", "The process of assimilating experiences into a cohesive sense of self, fostering resilience and well-being.", "Suppressing unwanted emotions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integration involves assimilating experiences (including traumatic ones) to create a more coherent sense of self. It's not just about recall or cognitive understanding, and it certainly doesn't involve suppression."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "According to research cited in the lesson on the Window of Tolerance, what percentage of individuals with PTSD experience significant difficulty staying within their optimal arousal zone?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%.", "Approximately 30%.", "Approximately 50%.", "Approximately 70%."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that around 70% of individuals diagnosed with PTSD struggle to maintain arousal levels within their Window of Tolerance, often oscillating between hyperarousal and hypoarousal states. This statistic underscores the importance of integration techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "A client consistently resists engaging in somatic practices, stating they feel 'silly' and 'uncomfortable.' What is the MOST appropriate initial response from the therapist?",
            "options": ["Insist they participate, emphasizing the benefits.", "Immediately explore potential trauma underlying the resistance.", "Acknowledge their feelings and explore their concerns about the practice.", "Discontinue somatic work and focus solely on verbal processing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing resistance starts with validation and exploration. Forcing participation or immediately assuming trauma can be counterproductive. A collaborative approach is key."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which somatic practice is MOST directly aimed at helping a client regulate their nervous system by increasing awareness of internal sensations?",
            "options": ["Free association.", "Titration.", "Cognitive restructuring.", "Exposure therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration, a core concept in somatic experiencing, involves gradually exposing oneself to small amounts of trauma-related sensation and then allowing the nervous system to discharge the associated energy. It’s a direct regulation technique unlike the other options."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "In the context of narrative integration, what is the primary goal of helping a client create a coherent narrative of their traumatic experience?",
            "options": ["To completely forget the trauma.", "To intellectualize the trauma.", "To develop a sense of mastery and meaning from the experience.", "To blame others for the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Narrative integration aims to help clients make sense of their experiences, fostering a sense of agency and meaning-making. It's not about forgetting, intellectualizing, or blaming, but about integrating the experience into their life story."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "According to the lessons on creative expression, which art modality is MOST beneficial for accessing pre-verbal memories and emotions?",
            "options": ["Detailed realistic painting.", "Abstract expressionism.", "Precise geometric drawing.", "Formal poetry."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Abstract expressionism, with its emphasis on non-representational forms and spontaneous mark-making, can be particularly effective for accessing and expressing pre-verbal memories and emotions that are difficult to articulate verbally."

        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A client with a history of childhood abuse consistently dissociates during somatic therapy sessions. What is the MOST important ethical consideration for the therapist?",
            "options": ["To push the client to stay present despite the dissociation.", "To immediately confront the client about their avoidance.", "To prioritize the client's safety and grounding while respecting their dissociative process.", "To refer the client to a psychiatrist for medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Client safety is paramount. Forcing a client to stay present can be re-traumatizing. The therapist must work within the client's capacity, prioritizing grounding and safety while respecting their dissociative process."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A therapist is experiencing vicarious trauma due to their work with multiple trauma survivors. Which self-care strategy is MOST likely to be effective in mitigating these effects?",
            "options": ["Working longer hours to help more clients.", "Isolating themselves from social support to process their feelings alone.", "Engaging in regular supervision, setting boundaries, and practicing mindfulness.", "Ignoring their feelings and focusing on the needs of their clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective self-care involves proactive strategies like supervision, boundary setting, and mindfulness to manage the emotional demands of trauma work. Ignoring feelings or isolating oneself are counterproductive."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In the case study involving 'Sarah,' a 35-year-old trauma survivor, which intervention proved MOST effective in promoting integration after years of avoidance?",
            "options": ["Prolonged exposure therapy.", "Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).", "A combination of somatic experiencing, narrative therapy, and creative expression.", "Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study of Sarah highlighted the success of an integrative approach combining somatic experiencing, narrative therapy, and creative expression to address her avoidance and facilitate integration."

            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the role of the therapist in facilitating integration?",
            "options": ["To direct the client's process and provide all the answers.", "To act as a guide and create a safe space for the client to explore their own internal experience and find their own path to healing.", "To diagnose the client's issues and prescribe specific interventions.", "To remain completely neutral and avoid any emotional engagement with the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist's role is to facilitate, not to dictate. Creating a safe space, offering guidance, and empowering the client to explore their own experience are essential for promoting integration."
