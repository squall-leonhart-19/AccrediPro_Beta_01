            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element to establish BEFORE initiating advanced somatic discharge techniques with a client who has complex trauma?",
            "options": ["Detailed trauma narrative collection", "A strong and secure therapeutic alliance", "Hypnotic induction for emotional release", "Immediate exposure to traumatic memories"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong therapeutic alliance builds trust and safety, which is paramount for clients with complex trauma before engaging in potentially destabilizing discharge work. Premature exposure can be re-traumatizing."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, what is the primary function of the ventral vagal pathway?",
            "options": ["Mobilization for fight or flight", "Social engagement and connection", "Shutdown and immobilization", "Pain perception"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal pathway promotes social engagement, connection, and feelings of safety. It is crucial to activate this pathway before attempting somatic discharge to enhance the client's sense of security."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client begins to exhibit signs of dysregulation (e.g., hyperventilation, dissociation) during a somatic discharge exercise. What is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to push through the discomfort", "Immediately stop the exercise and guide them through a grounding technique", "Analyze the symbolic meaning of their reaction", "Increase the intensity of the exercise to facilitate release"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety is paramount. Immediately stopping the exercise and using a grounding technique will help the client regain a sense of presence and control, preventing further dysregulation."

            "options": ["Free association", "Pendulation", "Cognitive restructuring", "Exposure therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation, alternating between resourced states and trauma-related sensations, helps the client gradually expand their capacity to be present with their body's sensations without becoming overwhelmed, fostering embodied presence."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of somatic interventions when working with a client experiencing dissociation?",
            "options": ["To fully recover repressed memories", "To increase the client's capacity for grounding and re-association", "To eliminate dissociative symptoms entirely", "To encourage detachment from emotional experiences"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic work aims to help clients experiencing dissociation to safely reconnect with their bodies and the present moment, increasing their capacity for grounding and re-association, rather than focusing solely on memory retrieval or symptom elimination."

            "options": ["Submitting to the therapist's authority", "Allowing the body's natural impulses and movements to emerge without resistance", "Suppressing unwanted emotions", "Intellectualizing traumatic experiences"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Yielding involves befriending resistance and embracing uncertainty by allowing the body's natural impulses and movements to emerge without conscious control, facilitating deeper emotional processing and release."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 35-year-old client, presents with chronic anxiety and a history of childhood emotional neglect.

            "options": ["Encourage Sarah to fully express her anger and rage", "Help Sarah identify a 'felt sense' of safety and resource within her body", "Immediately delve into the details of her childhood neglect", "Administer a relaxation exercise and terminate the session"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "According to Levine's model, it is crucial to help the client identify and anchor to a sense of safety and resource before processing traumatic material. This allows for a more gradual and regulated release of energy, preventing overwhelm and re-traumatization."
