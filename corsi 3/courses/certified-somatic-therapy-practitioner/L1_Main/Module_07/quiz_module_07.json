            "question": "In trauma-informed somatic therapy, what is the PRIMARY focus when working with a client's sensations?",
            "options": ["Immediately resolving the sensations.", "Analyzing the sensations for their psychological meaning.", "Creating a safe and regulated environment to explore sensations.", "Encouraging the client to ignore uncomfortable sensations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary focus is on safety and regulation, creating a container for the client to explore sensations without feeling overwhelmed or re-traumatized. This aligns with van der Kolk's emphasis on safety in trauma recovery."

        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "When taking a somatic history, what is a crucial question to ask regarding intergenerational trauma?",
            "options": ["What are your earliest childhood memories?", "How would you describe your relationship with your parents?", "Are there any patterns of unexplained physical symptoms or emotional difficulties in your family history?", "What are your financial goals?"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring patterns of unexplained symptoms or difficulties can uncover potential intergenerational trauma. This approach is supported by research on the epigenetic transmission of trauma (Yehuda et al., 2016)."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is the BEST example of 'befriending the body' in a somatic therapy context?",
            "options": ["Pushing through physical discomfort to achieve a fitness goal.", "Engaging in rigorous exercise to distract from emotional pain.", "Practicing mindful body scans and noticing sensations without judgment.", "Ignoring physical symptoms and focusing on cognitive restructuring."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Befriending the body involves cultivating self-compassion and acceptance of physical sensations, as advocated by Kristin Neff and Christopher Germer. Mindful body scans promote awareness without judgment."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client suddenly starts tapping their foot rapidly during a session while recalling a stressful event. According to the 'Observing Impulses' principle, what is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately redirecting their attention to a relaxation technique.", "Interpreting the foot tapping as a sign of anxiety and offering reassurance.", "Gently acknowledging the movement and inviting the client to notice what they are experiencing.", "Ignoring the foot tapping and continuing with the planned intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the movement and inviting the client to notice their experience honors the body's communication and allows for exploration of underlying impulses. This aligns with Levine's work on somatic experiencing and titration."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",

            "options": ["Encouraging the client to intensely re-experience the traumatic event.", "Using forceful physical manipulations to release tension.", "Employing gentle, titrated movements and visualizations to support natural release.", "Administering a high dose of muscle relaxants under supervision."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safe discharge involves gentle, titrated approaches that allow the body to release tension without overwhelming the nervous system. This is consistent with techniques used in Somatic Experiencing (Levine, 1997)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to foster embodied wholeness by allowing natural processing and integration. This aligns with the principles of mindfulness and acceptance-based therapies (Hayes et al., 2012)."

            "id": "q7_7",

This aligns with research on the mind-body connection in chronic pain (Gatchel et al., 2014)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding and reassessment are crucial for ensuring client safety and stability. Sensory-based techniques can help bring the client back into the present moment and regulate their nervous system (Ogden et al., 2006)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves gradually exposing the client to small doses of sensory experiences, allowing them to process the trauma in a manageable way. This approach minimizes the risk of re-traumatization (Levine, 1997)."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Solely focusing on somatic techniques can lead to all of the listed pitfalls. A comprehensive approach that integrates cognitive, emotional, and somatic elements is essential for effective trauma resolution (van der Kolk, 2014)."
