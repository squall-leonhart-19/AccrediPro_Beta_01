            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports experiencing significant dissociation during somatic therapy sessions. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Immediately proceed with deep tissue release to address the pain source.", "Ground the client using sensory awareness exercises before exploring pain-related memories.", "Encourage the client to push through the dissociation to access the underlying emotions.", "Refer the client to a psychiatrist for immediate medication management."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques help re-establish a sense of presence and safety, which is crucial before addressing potentially overwhelming pain-related emotions or memories. Pushing through dissociation can be re-traumatizing."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to research cited in the module, what percentage of individuals with eating disorders also have a history of trauma?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 80% of individuals with eating disorders have a history of trauma, highlighting the importance of trauma-informed care in treatment."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In a case study presented, a client 'Sarah' with a history of attachment trauma and anxiety frequently exhibited hyperventilation during sessions. Which somatic technique proved MOST effective in regulating her breathing?",
            "options": ["Diaphragmatic breathing exercises combined with interoceptive awareness.", "Progressive muscle relaxation focused on tensing and releasing abdominal muscles.", "Rapid, shallow breathing to match her current state and then gradually slow down.", "Guided imagery involving visualizing a peaceful scene with no emphasis on breath."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing, coupled with interoceptive awareness (paying attention to internal bodily sensations), helps regulate the nervous system and promotes a sense of calm, directly addressing hyperventilation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which ethical principle is MOST directly challenged when a somatic therapist attempts to 'rescue' a client from their emotional pain or discomfort?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Justice"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Attempting to 'rescue' a client undermines their autonomy by interfering with their natural process of self-discovery and healing. It presumes the therapist knows what's best for the client."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client struggling with addiction expresses a strong aversion to traditional talk therapy. Which somatic approach might be MOST effective as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)", "Trauma-Sensitive Yoga", "Somatic Experiencing focusing on early childhood memories", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a focus on relapse prevention"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Trauma-Sensitive Yoga can be a less confrontational entry point for clients with addiction, as it focuses on body awareness, movement, and regulation without requiring extensive verbal processing of traumatic memories."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY difference between titration and pendulation in Somatic Experiencing?",
            "options": ["Titration involves accessing highly charged memories, while pendulation focuses on present-moment sensations.", "Titration involves gradually exposing the client to traumatic material, while pendulation involves oscillating between resource and distress.", "Titration is used for anxiety, while pendulation is used for depression.", "There is no significant difference; the terms are interchangeable."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves gradual exposure to small amounts of traumatic material, allowing the nervous system to process it in manageable doses. Pendulation involves oscillating between sensations of safety (resource) and distress, building resilience."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client with body image issues consistently refers to their body as 'disgusting' and 'unworthy.' What somatic intervention would BEST address this negative self-perception?",
            "options": ["Mirror work involving positive affirmations about their appearance.", "Engaging in vigorous exercise to change their body shape.", "Exploring the felt sense of their body without judgment and focusing on its inherent functions.", "Creating a detailed list of their physical imperfections to identify areas for improvement."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Exploring the felt sense of the body without judgment allows the client to connect with their body in a non-critical way, fostering acceptance and appreciation for its inherent functions rather than focusing on perceived flaws."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the context of complex trauma, what is the PRIMARY goal of using advanced somatic techniques like developmental movement patterns?",
            "options": ["To suppress traumatic memories and avoid emotional distress.", "To reorganize disrupted neural pathways and promote a sense of embodied self.", "To physically correct postural imbalances caused by trauma.", "To rapidly process traumatic experiences through intense emotional release."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developmental movement patterns aim to reorganize disrupted neural pathways by revisiting and integrating early movement experiences, fostering a stronger sense of embodied self and regulation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A somatic therapist is working with a client who has a history of both chronic pain and substance abuse. During a session, the client reports intense cravings. What is the MOST ethically sound course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately terminate the session and refer the client to a detoxification center.", "Encourage the client to use their coping mechanisms (e.g., deep breathing) and continue with the planned somatic work.", "Acknowledge the client's experience, explore the somatic sensations associated with the cravings, and ensure the client has adequate support systems in place.", "Prescribe a low dose of anti-anxiety medication to manage the cravings."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the client's experience, exploring the somatic sensations, and ensuring support is the most ethically sound approach. Terminating the session abruptly could be destabilizing. Prescribing medication is outside the scope of practice for a somatic therapist."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "What is the potential risk of implementing somatic techniques too aggressively with a client who presents with high levels of anxiety and a fragile sense of self?",
            "options": ["Increased muscle soreness and fatigue.", "Re-traumatization and destabilization.", "Rapid resolution of anxiety symptoms.", "Development of a stronger therapeutic alliance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aggressive somatic techniques can overwhelm a client with high anxiety and a fragile sense of self, potentially leading to re-traumatization and destabilization due to a lack of sufficient grounding and regulation skills."
