            "question": "Which advanced breathwork technique is MOST directly aimed at regulating the nervous system by stimulating the vagus nerve?",
            "options": ["Box Breathing", "Diaphragmatic Breathing with prolonged exhale", "Alternate Nostril Breathing", "Kapalabhati Breathing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing with a prolonged exhale specifically stimulates the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and reducing the 'fight or flight' response. Studies show that a longer exhale activates the parasympathetic nervous system more effectively."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In advanced touch techniques for attachment, what is the primary goal when working with a client who exhibits avoidant attachment patterns?",
            "options": ["To encourage emotional expression and catharsis.", "To gradually introduce safe and predictable touch experiences.", "To challenge their belief that others are unreliable.", "To immediately establish a deep sense of connection."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For clients with avoidant attachment, the focus is on building trust through slow, predictable touch experiences. Research suggests that overwhelming them with intense touch can reinforce their avoidance tendencies."

            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which of the following represents the MOST evolved and safest state of social engagement?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Shutdown", "Sympathetic Activation", "Ventral Vagal Engagement", "Freeze Response"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ventral Vagal Engagement is the state of safety and connection, characterized by social engagement, calm, and regulation. It's the most evolved state according to Polyvagal Theory."

            "question": "In Somatic Experiencing®, what is the purpose of 'titration' in the context of trauma processing?",
            "options": ["To completely eliminate the traumatic memory.", "To gradually expose the client to small, manageable amounts of trauma-related sensation.", "To rapidly discharge all pent-up emotional energy.", "To avoid any contact with traumatic material."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves exposing the client to small, manageable doses of trauma-related sensation to avoid overwhelming the nervous system. This allows for gradual processing and integration of the trauma."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "When integrating Internal Family Systems (IFS) with Somatic Therapy, what is the primary goal when working with a client's 'Protector' part?",
            "options": ["To eliminate the Protector's behaviors.", "To understand the Protector's fears and motivations.", "To force the Protector to step aside.", "To immediately access the 'Exile' part."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal is to understand the Protector's role and motivations, recognizing that it is trying to protect the system. Only with understanding and compassion can the Protector allow access to the more vulnerable 'Exile' parts."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In advanced movement repatterning, what is the significance of 'developmental movement patterns'?",
            "options": ["They are irrelevant to adult movement patterns.", "They are the only movement patterns that matter.", "They form the foundation for more complex movement skills.", "They are solely determined by genetics."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Developmental movement patterns, established in infancy and early childhood, lay the groundwork for all subsequent movement abilities. Disruptions in these patterns can contribute to movement dysfunction later in life."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key somatic intervention when working with developmental trauma related to early attachment?",
            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring of negative beliefs.", "Re-enacting the traumatic event in detail.", "Creating safe and attuned co-regulation experiences.", "Encouraging the client to suppress emotional expression."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For developmental trauma, creating safe and attuned co-regulation experiences is crucial to repair early attachment wounds. This involves the therapist providing a sense of safety and connection that was missing in the client's early life."

            "options": ["Exploring the root causes of the addiction in childhood.", "Engaging in a grounding exercise to connect to the present moment.", "Creating a detailed relapse prevention plan.", "Encouraging them to fully indulge in the craving."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises help bring the client back to the present moment and regulate their nervous system, providing immediate relief from the intensity of the craving. This is a practical application of somatic awareness."

            "question": "Case Study: A 40-year-old client, Sarah, reports chronic anxiety and difficulty setting boundaries. During a somatic session, she notices a tightening in her chest when asked to assert her needs. Which somatic intervention would be MOST appropriate to begin with?",
            "options": ["Immediately challenging her limiting beliefs about self-worth.", "Encouraging her to push through the discomfort and assert herself.", "Guiding her to explore the sensations in her chest with curiosity and gentle awareness.", "Ignoring the physical sensation and focusing on cognitive strategies."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most appropriate initial step is to guide Sarah to explore the physical sensations with curiosity and gentle awareness. This allows her to become more embodied and regulate her nervous system before addressing the underlying issues."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Levine (2015) and other research indicates that approximately 20% of individuals exposed to trauma will develop PTSD if they do not receive appropriate intervention. This highlights the importance of early and effective trauma treatment."
