            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "A client consistently reports feeling 'stuck' in their body, experiencing chronic muscle tension and restricted movement. Which somatic intervention would be MOST appropriate to initiate with this client?",
            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring techniques.", "Diaphragmatic breathing exercises and gentle movement exploration.", "Exposure therapy for trauma-related memories.", "Prescription of muscle relaxants."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing and gentle movement are effective for addressing chronic tension and promoting body awareness, aligning with somatic principles. Starting with gentler approaches is often best."
