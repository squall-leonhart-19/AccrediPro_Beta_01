        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which neurobiological structure is MOST directly involved in the 'freeze' response during a traumatic event, as discussed in the context of Somatic Experiencing?",
            "options": ["Prefrontal Cortex", "Amygdala", "Dorsal Vagal Complex", "Hippocampus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dorsal Vagal Complex is primarily responsible for the 'freeze' response, leading to immobilization and dissociation during overwhelming threat."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of somatic interventions for trauma revealed a statistically significant reduction in PTSD symptoms. Assuming the analysis reported a Cohen's d effect size, which value would indicate the LARGEST effect?",
            "options": ["d = 0.2", "d = 0.5", "d = 0.8", "d = 1.2"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cohen's d of 1.2 indicates a large effect size, suggesting a substantial impact of the somatic intervention on PTSD symptoms. Larger Cohen's d values represent greater effect sizes."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the context of somatic approaches to anxiety, which practice directly addresses the physiological symptoms of anxiety by focusing on conscious regulation of breathing?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Restructuring", "Progressive Muscle Relaxation", "Diaphragmatic Breathing", "Exposure Therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing directly targets the physiological symptoms of anxiety by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and promoting relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, reports chronic lower back pain. Which somatic technique would be MOST appropriate as an initial intervention to address the body-mind connection in her pain experience?",
            "options": ["Deep Tissue Massage", "Mindfulness Meditation focusing on body sensations", "Chiropractic Adjustment", "Administering NSAIDs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation focusing on body sensations helps Sarah become aware of and accept her pain experience without judgment, potentially reducing tension and promoting relaxation, which is a core principle in managing chronic pain somatically."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "According to attachment theory, what is the MOST likely somatic presentation in an adult with a history of anxious-preoccupied attachment?",
            "options": ["Rigid posture and difficulty expressing emotions", "Chronic muscle tension and hypervigilance", "Flat affect and emotional detachment", "Disorganized movements and unpredictable emotional outbursts"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anxious-preoccupied attachment often manifests as chronic muscle tension and hypervigilance due to heightened anxiety and a constant need for reassurance from others."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which ethical principle is MOST directly challenged when a somatic therapist conducts research on their own clients without proper safeguards?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Justice", "Non-maleficence"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Non-maleficence, or 'do no harm', is most directly challenged as the power dynamic between therapist and client could lead to exploitation or coercion, potentially causing harm."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a validated and reliable tool specifically designed to measure body awareness and interoceptive accuracy in somatic therapy research?",
            "options": ["Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)", "Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)", "Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ)", "Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) is specifically designed to assess an individual's awareness of their internal bodily sensations and is commonly used in somatic therapy research."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What emerging technology holds the MOST promise for objectively measuring physiological changes during somatic therapy interventions, potentially enhancing research validity?",
            "options": ["fMRI", "Virtual Reality (VR)", "Wearable Biosensors", "Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Wearable biosensors (e.g., heart rate variability monitors, skin conductance sensors) offer a non-invasive and objective way to track physiological changes in real-time during somatic therapy sessions, providing valuable data for research."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A study investigating the impact of somatic therapy on depression included a control group receiving standard talk therapy. The somatic therapy group showed a 30% reduction in depressive symptoms compared to a 15% reduction in the control group. Which statistical test would be MOST appropriate to determine if this difference is statistically significant?",
            "options": ["Chi-Square Test", "T-test", "ANOVA", "Regression Analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A t-test is appropriate for comparing the means of two independent groups (somatic therapy vs. control) to determine if the difference in symptom reduction is statistically significant."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "In future somatic therapy research, what is considered a critical area for development to enhance the cultural relevance and accessibility of interventions?",
            "options": ["Developing manualized treatment protocols", "Focusing solely on Western populations", "Ignoring the role of trauma", "Adapting interventions to diverse cultural contexts and beliefs"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adapting somatic interventions to diverse cultural contexts and beliefs is crucial for ensuring their relevance, effectiveness, and accessibility across different populations, addressing potential biases and promoting equitable care."
