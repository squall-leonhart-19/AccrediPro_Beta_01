            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial first step when working with a client presenting with acute suicidal ideation?",
            "options": ["Establishing rapport and trust.", "Assessing the immediate risk of suicide.", "Exploring the client's past trauma.", "Teaching self-hypnosis techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing the immediate risk is paramount. While rapport and trauma history are important, safety takes precedence. A 2018 study in the 'Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention' highlighted that immediate risk assessment significantly reduces adverse outcomes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client with a history of complex trauma presents with significant dissociation during a hypnotherapy session. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate intervention?",
            "options": ["Deepening the hypnotic trance to bypass the dissociation.", "Immediately terminating the session and providing grounding techniques.", "Gently guiding the client back to the present moment using sensory anchors.", "Exploring the content of the dissociated state in detail."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gently grounding the client is the safest approach. Deepening the trance could exacerbate dissociation. Exploring the dissociated state without proper stabilization is potentially retraumatizing. Sensory anchors help to reconnect with the present."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "In the context of grief and loss, what is 'complicated grief' characterized by?",
            "options": ["A normal and healthy expression of sadness.", "Grief that persists beyond 12 months and significantly impairs functioning.", "The absence of any visible signs of mourning.", "Rapid resolution of grief within a few weeks."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complicated grief is characterized by prolonged grief symptoms that significantly interfere with daily life. Research from Shear et al. (2011) in 'JAMA' defines it as grief lasting beyond 12 months with significant functional impairment."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which hypnotic technique is MOST effective for helping a client with addiction to visualize a future free from substance dependence?",
            "options": ["Age regression.", "Future pacing.", "Parts therapy.", "Ericksonian suggestion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Future pacing allows the client to vividly imagine and experience a positive future without addiction, reinforcing motivation and building resilience. While other techniques can be helpful, future pacing directly targets future outcomes."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A hypnotherapist working with a client who has a history of self-harm should be MOST aware of which ethical consideration?",
            "options": ["The client's right to self-determination.", "Maintaining absolute client confidentiality at all costs.", "The therapist's personal beliefs about self-harm.", "The legal obligation to report all instances of self-harm."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While all options are relevant, the client's right to self-determination is paramount, balanced with the duty to protect from harm. Mandatory reporting laws vary, and ethical practice requires careful consideration of the client's autonomy."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on case conceptualization, what is the PRIMARY benefit of developing a comprehensive case formulation for complex clients?",
            "options": ["It provides a definitive diagnosis.", "It guarantees treatment success.", "It guides treatment planning and helps anticipate potential challenges.", "It eliminates the need for ongoing assessment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive case formulation helps the therapist understand the client's unique history, patterns, and challenges, leading to more effective treatment planning and anticipating potential obstacles. It does not guarantee success or eliminate the need for ongoing assessment."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 35, presents with PTSD after a car accident. She reports flashbacks and hyperarousal. Which hypnotic technique would be MOST appropriate for initially reducing her anxiety and promoting relaxation?",
            "options": ["Age regression to the moment of the accident.", "Ego-state therapy to address fragmented parts of self.", "A safe place imagery exercise combined with progressive relaxation.", "Direct suggestion for symptom reduction."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A safe place imagery exercise combined with progressive relaxation provides immediate relief from anxiety and promotes a sense of safety and control. It is less likely to be retraumatizing than directly addressing the trauma initially."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'titration' when working with trauma memories in hypnosis?",
            "options": ["To completely erase the traumatic memory.", "To overwhelm the client with the full intensity of the trauma.", "To gradually expose the client to small, manageable aspects of the trauma.", "To avoid addressing the trauma altogether."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves gradually exposing the client to small, manageable fragments of the trauma, allowing them to process it without being overwhelmed. This approach promotes safety and control."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client reports using alcohol to cope with intense feelings of loneliness and worthlessness following the death of their spouse. Which of the following is the MOST important initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Immediately confronting the client about their alcohol use.", "Exploring the underlying grief and providing emotional support.", "Referring the client to a detoxification program.", "Teaching the client advanced hypnotic techniques for addiction."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying grief and providing emotional support is crucial. The alcohol use is likely a coping mechanism, and addressing the root cause (grief) is essential. While other interventions may be necessary later, addressing the grief is the priority."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "According to the lesson on ethical considerations, what is 'dual relationship' and why is it generally discouraged in therapeutic settings?",
            "options": ["Having two therapists working with the same client.", "A therapeutic relationship that is twice as long as expected.", "A situation where the therapist has another significant relationship with the client outside of therapy.", "Using two different hypnotic techniques in the same session."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A dual relationship occurs when the therapist has another significant relationship with the client outside of therapy (e.g., friend, business partner). It is generally discouraged because it can compromise objectivity, exploit the client, and create a conflict of interest."
