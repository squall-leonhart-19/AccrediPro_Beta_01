            "question": "A client seeking hypnotherapy for smoking cessation also presents with symptoms suggestive of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). What is the MOST important ethical consideration in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Guaranteeing successful smoking cessation within a set timeframe.", "Avoiding setting boundaries to maintain rapport with the client.", "Recognizing the limitations of hypnotherapy and referring for specialized mental health treatment if needed.", "Focusing solely on the addiction without addressing underlying emotional issues."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Recognizing the limitations of hypnotherapy and referring for specialized mental health treatment is crucial when personality disorders are suspected. Hypnotherapy may not be sufficient to address the complex needs of individuals with BPD, and attempting to do so without proper training could be harmful. The comorbidity needs to be addressed by a specialist and the hypnotherapist needs to be aware of the potential interactions."
