            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY reason for obtaining informed consent from a hypnotherapy client?",
            "options": ["To protect the hypnotherapist from all potential lawsuits.", "To ensure the client is fully aware of the nature of the treatment, potential risks, and expected benefits.", "To simplify the therapeutic process and reduce the need for detailed explanations.", "To comply with advertising regulations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent ensures the client understands the treatment, potential risks, and benefits, fostering autonomy and shared decision-making. While it may offer some legal protection, that is not its primary purpose."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons on confidentiality, under what circumstances is a hypnotherapist legally OBLIGATED to disclose client information without the client's consent?",
            "options": ["When the client is late for multiple appointments.", "When the hypnotherapist believes the client is not making sufficient progress.", "When there is a legal mandate, such as a court order or a duty to warn.", "When discussing the case with a supervisor for professional development."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Legal mandates like court orders or duty to warn (e.g., if a client poses an imminent threat to themselves or others) override confidentiality. The other options do not typically warrant breaching confidentiality."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Making guaranteed claims, especially regarding cures, is generally prohibited in advertising therapeutic services. Such claims can be misleading and violate advertising standards. The other options are generally acceptable."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "explanation": "Ethically, collaboration with other healthcare professionals, with the client's consent, is the best approach to ensure coordinated and comprehensive care. The other options are unethical and potentially harmful."

            "id": "q33_7",
            "question": "A client discloses to their hypnotherapist that they are planning to harm another person. According to the 'duty to warn' principle, what is the hypnotherapist's MOST appropriate course of action?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'duty to warn' principle requires therapists to take reasonable steps to protect potential victims when a client poses a credible and imminent threat. This typically involves informing the intended victim and the authorities, after consulting with a supervisor and following legal and ethical guidelines. Maintaining confidentiality is not appropriate in this situation."
