            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element in establishing a strong foundation for hypnotherapy?",
            "options": ["Suggestibility assessment", "Deep trance induction", "Building trust and rapport", "Eliciting client history"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all options are important, trust and rapport are foundational for client openness and successful hypnotherapy outcomes. Without trust, the client is less likely to engage fully."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client states, 'I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work.' Which active listening response is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["'You'll be fine, just relax.'", "'I understand. So, you feel like you've exhausted all options and are feeling hopeless?'", "'Let's focus on the positives.'", "'Have you considered medication?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflecting the client's feelings of hopelessness validates their experience and demonstrates understanding, fostering deeper rapport. Dismissing their feelings or immediately offering solutions can shut down communication."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Empathy involves:",
            "options": ["Sharing your personal experiences with the client.", "Understanding and sharing the feelings of another.", "Sympathizing with the client's situation.", "Offering unsolicited advice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empathy is about understanding and sharing the feelings of another person, putting yourself in their shoes, not just sympathizing (feeling sorry) or offering advice."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which mirroring technique is MOST likely to be perceived negatively if not done subtly?",
            "options": ["Mirroring posture", "Mirroring speech patterns", "Mirroring breathing rate", "Mirroring facial expressions"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mirroring facial expressions, if done overtly, can feel mocking or insincere. Subtle mirroring of posture or speech patterns is generally more effective in building rapport without being noticed consciously."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Creating a safe and comfortable environment primarily involves:",
            "options": ["Dimming the lights and playing relaxing music.", "Ensuring physical comfort and emotional safety.", "Having a separate exit for the client.", "Using specific aromatherapy scents."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While physical comfort is important, ensuring emotional safety through clear communication, boundaries, and respect is paramount for creating a truly safe environment for the client to open up and engage in hypnotherapy."

            "options": ["Closed-ended questions", "Leading questions", "Open-ended questions", "Rhetorical questions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions encourage clients to elaborate and provide more detailed responses, allowing the hypnotherapist to gain a deeper understanding of their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. Closed-ended questions limit responses to 'yes' or 'no'."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client expresses skepticism about hypnotherapy. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Challenge their beliefs with scientific evidence.", "Dismiss their concerns and proceed with the session.", "Acknowledge their skepticism and explore their concerns.", "Immediately begin a demonstration to prove its effectiveness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and exploring the client's skepticism demonstrates respect and willingness to understand their perspective, which is essential for building trust and addressing resistance. Directly challenging or dismissing their concerns can further damage rapport."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",

            "options": ["30%", "55%", "70%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson highlights research suggesting that approximately 70% of communication is non-verbal, emphasizing the importance of observing body language and tone of voice in building rapport."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "During a session, a client begins to cry. What is the MOST appropriate action?",
            "options": ["Immediately offer a tissue and change the subject.", "Tell them to stop crying and focus.", "Acknowledge their emotions and offer support.", "Ignore their tears and continue with the planned script."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging their emotions with empathy and offering support validates their experience and deepens the therapeutic relationship. Ignoring their tears or abruptly changing the subject can be dismissive and damaging to rapport. Allowing the client to experience and process their emotions in a safe space is crucial."
