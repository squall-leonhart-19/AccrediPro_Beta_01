            "options": ["Logical reasoning", "Short-term memory recall", "Storing long-term memories and habits", "Conscious decision-making"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The subconscious mind is primarily responsible for storing long-term memories, habits, and automatic responses, as discussed in Lesson 1. It operates largely outside of conscious awareness."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of hypnotic induction, what is rapport and why is it important?",
            "options": ["A specific set of verbal commands used to induce hypnosis; it is important for standardization.", "A state of deep relaxation achieved through progressive muscle relaxation; it is important for physical comfort.", "A trusting and harmonious relationship between the hypnotherapist and the client; it is important for client cooperation and suggestibility.", "A method of testing hypnotic depth using ideomotor responses; it is important for confirming trance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapport is the establishment of a trusting and harmonious relationship. It's crucial because a client who feels understood and safe is more likely to relax and be receptive to suggestions, as highlighted in Lesson 2."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "During a pre-induction talk, what is the MOST important goal?",
            "options": ["To diagnose the client's underlying psychological issues.", "To educate the client about hypnosis, address any misconceptions, and establish clear expectations.", "To demonstrate your expertise in hypnotherapy.", "To immediately begin the hypnotic induction to save time."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pre-induction talk (Lesson 3) aims to demystify hypnosis, address client concerns, and set realistic expectations. This preparation significantly impacts the success of the session."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "In progressive relaxation, what is the purpose of tensing and then releasing muscle groups?",
            "options": ["To cause physical discomfort and test the client's pain tolerance.", "To create a clear contrast between tension and relaxation, making the relaxation phase more noticeable and effective.", "To build muscle strength.", "To distract the client from their thoughts."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The tensing and releasing technique in progressive relaxation (Lesson 4) amplifies the feeling of relaxation by providing a distinct contrast. This heightened awareness facilitates deeper relaxation."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important element when using visualization and imagery in hypnotic induction?",
            "options": ["Using complex and detailed imagery to fully engage the client's mind.", "Encouraging the client to use their own personally meaningful and positive imagery.", "Focusing on negative imagery to help the client confront their fears.", "Controlling the client's imagination to ensure a specific outcome."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personalization is key to effective visualization (Lesson 5). When clients use their own imagery, it resonates more deeply and facilitates a stronger hypnotic experience. Positive imagery is emphasized for its therapeutic effect."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client is in a light state of hypnosis. Which of the following deepening techniques would be MOST appropriate to use NEXT?",
            "options": ["Rapid induction techniques.", "Fractionation (repeatedly deepening and lightening the trance).", "Direct suggestions of deeper relaxation, such as counting down or visualizing descending stairs.", "Ericksonian techniques that require a very deep trance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client is in a light trance, gentle techniques like counting down or visualizing descending stairs (Lesson 6) are effective for inducing deeper relaxation without overwhelming the client. Fractionation can also be used, but direct suggestions are often a good first step."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "What is an ideomotor response, and how is it used to test for hypnotic depth?",
            "options": ["A sudden emotional outburst indicating repressed trauma; used to identify areas for therapeutic intervention.", "An involuntary muscular movement in response to a suggestion; used to gauge the client's level of suggestibility and depth of trance.", "A verbal affirmation of the hypnotic experience; used to confirm that the client is consciously aware of being hypnotized.", "A change in heart rate or breathing pattern; used to monitor the client's physiological state during hypnosis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ideomotor responses (Lesson 7) are involuntary muscle movements that indicate the client is responding to suggestions at a subconscious level. They are a valuable tool for assessing hypnotic depth and responsiveness."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client reveals during a session that they have a previously undisclosed mental health condition that may be contraindicated for hypnotherapy. What is the ETHICALLY appropriate course of action?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice (Lesson 8) requires recognizing the limits of your expertise. If a client's condition falls outside your scope of practice, referral is essential to ensure their safety and well-being."

            "question": "You are working with a client using progressive relaxation. The client reports feeling anxious and uncomfortable during the tensing phase. What should you do?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to push through the discomfort, as it is a necessary part of the process.", "Immediately stop the tensing phase and focus solely on relaxation techniques.", "Reduce the intensity and duration of the tensing phase, or eliminate it altogether, while still focusing on the release.", "Suggest they are imagining the tensing phase if they are physically unable to do it."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client comfort and safety are paramount. If a client experiences discomfort during the tensing phase (Lesson 4), it's important to modify the technique to ensure a positive and comfortable experience. Eliminating or reducing the intensity of the tensing phase is a suitable adjustment."
