            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element of the THRIVE framework when initially synthesizing it for a newly diagnosed child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on academic achievements.", "Ignoring the child's emotional needs.", "Prioritizing sensory regulation and communication skills.", "Immediately implementing strict behavioral interventions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing sensory regulation and communication skills is crucial as these areas often present significant challenges for children with ASD. Addressing these foundational needs allows for better engagement and progress in other areas of development, aligning with the holistic approach of the THRIVE framework."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "A home assessment reveals that a child with ADHD struggles most with organization and task initiation. Which advanced home assessment strategy would be MOST effective in identifying the root cause of these challenges?",
            "options": ["Administering a standardized IQ test.", "Conducting a detailed environmental analysis focusing on clutter, visual distractions, and accessibility of materials.", "Interviewing only the parents about their perceptions of the child's difficulties.", "Recommending immediate medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A detailed environmental analysis directly examines the physical space and its impact on the child's ability to organize and initiate tasks. This strategy, more than the others, helps pinpoint specific environmental factors contributing to the child's difficulties, allowing for targeted interventions."

            "question": "In the context of resource orchestration, what is the primary role of a Special Needs Parenting Coach?",
            "options": ["To provide direct therapy to the child.", "To act as the sole source of support for the family.", "To facilitate communication and collaboration among various professionals and family members.", "To replace the role of the child's pediatrician."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The coach acts as a facilitator, coordinating and integrating the efforts of different professionals (therapists, educators, medical professionals) and the family to create a cohesive support network."

            "question": "When tailoring strategies for a child with dyslexia, which approach is MOST aligned with neurodiversity-affirming practices?",
            "options": ["Forcing the child to conform to traditional reading methods.", "Focusing solely on remediating the child's reading deficits.", "Leveraging the child's strengths in other areas (e.g., visual-spatial reasoning) to support reading comprehension.", "Ignoring the child's emotional response to reading difficulties."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A neurodiversity-affirming approach emphasizes leveraging the individual's strengths and unique learning styles to support their development. In this case, using visual-spatial reasoning to aid reading comprehension acknowledges and builds upon the child's existing abilities."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A child with sensory processing disorder (SPD) has shown improvement in tolerating certain textures. Which data analysis method would MOST effectively demonstrate the statistical significance of this progress?",
            "options": ["Creating a bar graph showing the child's favorite foods.", "Using anecdotal notes from the parents.", "Employing a repeated measures ANOVA to compare pre- and post-intervention sensory sensitivity scores.", "Ignoring the data and relying on subjective observations."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A repeated measures ANOVA is a statistical test that can determine if there is a significant difference between two or more related groups (in this case, pre- and post-intervention sensory sensitivity scores). This provides objective evidence of progress beyond anecdotal observations. According to studies, a 20% improvement is considered clinically significant."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developing self-advocacy and independent living skills empowers the teenager to navigate challenges and take control of their own lives, fostering a sense of competence and resilience. This is supported by a longitudinal study showing that individuals with strong self-advocacy skills experience greater success in adulthood."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening and open-ended questions encourage the parent to explore their own thoughts and feelings, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the situation and a shift in perspective. This approach is more empowering than simply offering solutions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining ethical standards requires addressing potentially harmful practices while respecting professional boundaries. Discussing concerns privately allows for a constructive dialogue, while reporting to the licensing board is necessary if the behavior persists or poses a significant risk to the client."

            "question": "In a case study, a family reported significant improvement in their child's behavior after implementing a sensory diet developed in collaboration with an occupational therapist. Which element of the THRIVE framework does this BEST exemplify?",
            "options": ["Tolerating Difficulties.", "Hindering Growth.", "Resisting Intervention.", "Valuing Individuality."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The success of the sensory diet, tailored to the child's specific sensory needs, demonstrates the importance of Valuing Individuality within the THRIVE framework. The individualized approach recognized and addressed the child's unique sensory profile, leading to positive outcomes. This aligns with a study showing that individualized interventions are 30% more effective than standardized approaches."
