            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element in determining if a parenting intervention qualifies as an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP)?",
            "options": ["Anecdotal reports from other parents.", "Support from a popular parenting blogger.", "Multiple high-quality research studies demonstrating its effectiveness.", "Alignment with personal beliefs and values."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-Based Practices are defined by their grounding in rigorous scientific research. Multiple high-quality studies are essential to demonstrate that the intervention consistently produces positive outcomes."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "You are searching for research on interventions for children with ADHD. Which database is MOST likely to yield comprehensive results focused specifically on psychological and educational interventions?",
            "options": ["PubMed.", "ERIC.", "Google Scholar.", "PsycINFO."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "PsycINFO is a database specifically focused on psychology and related disciplines, offering a wider range of relevant studies than PubMed or ERIC for this topic."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A study design that compares outcomes between a group receiving a new parenting intervention and a similar group receiving standard care, with participants randomly assigned to each group, is BEST described as:",
            "options": ["A case study.", "A correlational study.", "A randomized controlled trial (RCT).", "A qualitative study."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because they help minimize bias and establish cause-and-effect relationships."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the T.H.R.I.V.E. framework, research evidence primarily informs which domain?",
            "options": ["Teamwork.", "Hope.", "Resources.", "Intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Intervention' domain of the T.H.R.I.V.E. framework specifically focuses on selecting and implementing evidence-based strategies tailored to the child's needs."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "What is the MOST important factor to consider when evaluating the practical significance of a research study’s findings, even if the results are statistically significant?",
            "options": ["The sample size of the study.", "The p-value reported in the study.", "The effect size and its clinical relevance to the client's life.", "The researchers' affiliations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While statistical significance (p-value) indicates the likelihood that the results are not due to chance, the effect size and its clinical relevance determine whether the intervention makes a meaningful difference in the client's life."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "You are working with a family who is considering a controversial therapy that lacks strong empirical support. Ethically, what is your PRIMARY responsibility?",
            "options": ["To encourage them to try the therapy, as long as they are willing.", "To only recommend therapies you personally believe in.", "To fully inform them about the lack of evidence and potential risks, while respecting their autonomy.", "To pressure them to choose an evidence-based therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires providing clients with accurate information about the evidence base (or lack thereof) for different interventions, empowering them to make informed decisions while respecting their autonomy."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which of the following strategies is MOST effective for staying current with the latest research and best practices in special needs parenting?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on information from social media groups.", "Attending annual conferences and subscribing to relevant professional journals.", "Reading only books written more than 10 years ago.", "Ignoring research findings that contradict your personal experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attending conferences and subscribing to peer-reviewed journals are effective ways to stay updated on the latest research, advancements, and evidence-based practices in the field."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "When communicating research findings to parents, what is the MOST important principle to keep in mind?",
            "options": ["Using highly technical jargon to demonstrate your expertise.", "Presenting the information in a clear, concise, and understandable manner, avoiding excessive jargon.", "Downplaying any limitations of the research.", "Promoting your personal opinions as fact."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective communication involves tailoring the information to the parent's level of understanding, avoiding jargon, and focusing on the practical implications of the research."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 30 studies on positive parenting techniques for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showed an average effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.65. How should you interpret this effect size?",
            "options": ["The effect is negligible and not worth considering.", "The effect is small and may not be noticeable in practice.", "The effect is moderate and likely to be clinically meaningful for many families.", "The effect is very large and guarantees success for all families."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An effect size of 0.65 is generally considered a moderate effect, suggesting that positive parenting techniques are likely to have a meaningful impact on outcomes for many children with ASD. It's important to avoid overgeneralizations and consider individual circumstances."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "You are reviewing a study that used a quasi-experimental design to evaluate a new social skills intervention for adolescents with Down syndrome. What is the PRIMARY limitation of this type of design compared to a randomized controlled trial?",
            "options": ["Quasi-experimental designs are always unethical.", "Quasi-experimental designs are less expensive to conduct.", "Quasi-experimental designs cannot provide any useful information.", "Quasi-experimental designs have a higher risk of bias due to the lack of random assignment."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The lack of random assignment in quasi-experimental designs increases the risk of selection bias and makes it more difficult to attribute changes in outcomes solely to the intervention. RCTs are generally preferred when feasible."
