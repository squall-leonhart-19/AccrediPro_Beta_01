            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical coaching requires balancing respect for client autonomy with the responsibility to promote the child's well-being.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Outcome evaluation should focus on objective, measurable improvements in both the child's functioning and parental well-being, using validated assessment tools. This provides a more rigorous and reliable measure of program impact than subjective feedback alone. A 2023 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) found that coaching interventions demonstrating statistically significant improvements in adaptive behavior also reported reduced parental stress (p < .05)."

            "explanation": "This approach balances respect for the individual with the need to create an inclusive environment for all participants.
