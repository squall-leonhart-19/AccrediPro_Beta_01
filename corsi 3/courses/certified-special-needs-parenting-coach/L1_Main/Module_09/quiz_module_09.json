            "question": "Which of the following is NOT considered a primary sensory system affected by Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)?",
            "options": ["Vestibular", "Proprioceptive", "Visual", "Cognitive"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While cognitive function can be affected by SPD, it is not considered one of the primary sensory systems directly involved in the disorder. Vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual systems are core to sensory processing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "In the 'Tune-In' phase of the THRIVE model for SPD, what is the primary goal?",
            "options": ["Implementing sensory strategies", "Validating the child's progress", "Understanding the child's sensory profile and needs", "Empowering the child's independence"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Tune-In' phase focuses on deeply understanding the child's unique sensory profile, including their sensitivities, aversions, and seeking behaviors, to tailor interventions effectively."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Which aspect of a home environment is LEAST relevant when conducting a home assessment for a child with tactile defensiveness?",
            "options": ["The types of fabrics used in furniture and clothing", "The availability of quiet spaces for retreat", "The color of the walls in the child's bedroom", "The variety of textures in toys and household items"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While overall environment matters, the color of the walls is generally less relevant to tactile defensiveness than the textures and sensory experiences within the home."

            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "A parent describes their child as constantly seeking out movement, often spinning or swinging. According to the lessons, which sensory system is MOST likely involved?",
            "options": ["Auditory", "Visual", "Vestibular", "Olfactory"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Seeking spinning or swinging movements strongly indicates involvement of the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and spatial orientation."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "Which of the following resources would be MOST appropriate to recommend to a family seeking a comprehensive assessment for SPD?",
            "options": ["A general pediatrician", "A developmental optometrist", "An occupational therapist with specialized training in sensory integration", "A school psychologist"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Occupational therapists with specialized training in sensory integration are specifically qualified to conduct comprehensive assessments for SPD and develop tailored intervention plans."

            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "In the 'Implement Strategies' phase, what is a crucial consideration when introducing a new sensory activity to a child with SPD?",
            "options": ["Introducing multiple strategies simultaneously to maximize impact", "Ensuring the activity is always challenging to promote growth", "Monitoring the child's response and adjusting the activity as needed", "Ignoring any negative reactions and persisting with the activity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Careful monitoring and adjustment are essential to ensure the sensory activity is therapeutic and does not overwhelm or distress the child. Flexibility and responsiveness are key."

        {
            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "What type of data is MOST important to collect during the 'Validate Progress' phase of the THRIVE model?",
            "options": ["Parent's subjective opinions", "Teacher's anecdotal observations", "Standardized assessments and objective measures of sensory processing", "The child's willingness to participate in activities"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While subjective opinions and observations are valuable, standardized assessments and objective measures provide the most reliable and valid data for tracking progress and making informed decisions about intervention adjustments."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "When empowering independence for a child with SPD, which approach is MOST likely to be effective?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating all sensory challenges from their environment", "Gradually introducing sensory challenges in a controlled and supportive manner", "Forcing the child to confront their sensory sensitivities directly", "Ignoring the child's sensory needs to encourage resilience"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual exposure to sensory challenges, with appropriate support and coping strategies, helps the child develop resilience and independence in managing their sensory sensitivities."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "A special needs parenting coach observes a child exhibiting significant avoidance behaviors towards specific textures. According to the ethical guidelines discussed, what is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Encourage the parent to gradually expose the child to the textures at home.", "Suggest the parent consult with an occupational therapist for a comprehensive sensory assessment and intervention plan.", "Immediately implement a sensory diet to address the texture aversions.", "Tell the parent to ignore the child's aversions to help the child overcome them."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Referring to an occupational therapist ensures the child receives specialized assessment and intervention, aligning with the coach's ethical responsibility to work within their scope of practice and prioritize the child's well-being."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 60% of children with ADHD also experience symptoms of SPD, highlighting the significant overlap between these conditions."
