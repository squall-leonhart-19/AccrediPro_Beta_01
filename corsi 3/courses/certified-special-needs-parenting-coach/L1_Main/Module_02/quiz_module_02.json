            "explanation": "The IEP outlines the child's educational goals, objectives, and necessary accommodations, providing valuable context for understanding their needs and how the home environment can support their progress. According to IDEA, these documents are meant to be collaborative and accessible."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Replacing fluorescent lights with alternatives that offer adjustable brightness allows for greater control over the sensory input, minimizing the child's distress and creating a more comfortable environment. A 2018 study in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders found that modified lighting significantly reduced sensory overload in children with ASD."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Documentation should be objective, specific, and focused on the environmental barriers and their impact on the child's functioning. Avoid judgmental language or making recommendations outside your scope of expertise."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires balancing confidentiality with the child's safety and well-being.
