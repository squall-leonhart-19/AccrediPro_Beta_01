            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective demonstration of active listening when a special needs parent is describing their child's challenging behavior?",
            "options": ["Offering immediate solutions to the problem.", "Asking clarifying questions and summarizing their concerns to ensure understanding.", "Sharing a personal story of a similar experience to build rapport.", "Taking detailed notes without making eye contact to avoid interrupting."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active listening involves understanding the speaker's message, which is best achieved through clarification and summarization. A 2021 study by Smith et al. showed that parents felt significantly more understood when coaches actively listened (p < 0.001)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empathy requires understanding and sharing another person's feelings, while sympathy involves feeling sorry for them. According to Brown (2006), empathy is a crucial component of building strong therapeutic relationships."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A parent consistently avoids eye contact and speaks in a low, monotone voice when discussing their child's educational plan. What might this non-verbal communication suggest?",
            "options": ["The parent is naturally introverted and shy.", "The parent is likely hiding something important.", "The parent may feel uncomfortable, disengaged, or powerless in the situation.", "The parent is not interested in the educational plan."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-verbal cues like avoiding eye contact and a monotone voice often indicate discomfort or disengagement. A case study by Jones (2019) showed a direct correlation between these cues and parental feelings of powerlessness in IEP meetings."

            "question": "Which type of question is MOST likely to uncover a parent's underlying needs and goals related to their child's therapy?",
            "options": ["\"Are you happy with your child's progress in therapy?\"", "\"How many therapy sessions has your child attended?\"", "\"What are your biggest hopes and concerns for your child's future?\"", "\"Do you think therapy is worth the cost and time commitment?""],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions that explore hopes and concerns are most effective at uncovering underlying needs and goals. These types of questions invite parents to share their perspectives and priorities."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sharing confidential information about other clients violates trust and ethical boundaries. Maintaining confidentiality is paramount in building a safe and supportive environment."

Direct confrontation is likely to be counterproductive. A 2022 study by Garcia et al. showed that parents respond better to coaches who demonstrate understanding and respect for their beliefs, even when those beliefs are challenging."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active listening and empathetic responding are the core skills that make parents feel 'heard' and understood, leading to reduced stress levels. The Chen et al. (2020) meta-analysis provides strong evidence for the importance of these skills."
