            "options": ["Using astrological associations for each card.", "Relying solely on intuition without any structured method.", "Assigning timeframes based on the suit of the Minor Arcana (e.g., Wands for weeks).", "Ignoring timing altogether and focusing only on the event itself."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

As discussed in the lesson, this technique offers a practical framework when combined with your intuition."

This provides a deeper understanding of the card's core meaning and its place within the larger numerological system of the Tarot. For example, The Tower (16) reduces to 1+6=7, relating it to the energy of The Chariot (7)."
