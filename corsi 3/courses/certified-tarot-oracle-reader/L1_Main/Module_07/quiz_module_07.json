      "question": "A client, Sarah, age 35, receives a reading suggesting potential career challenges. To empower Sarah, which approach is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Tell Sarah to immediately quit her job and pursue a different career path.",
        "Explore potential strategies with Sarah to navigate the challenges and identify opportunities for growth within her current role or elsewhere.",

      "options": [
        "Tarot readings should always be presented as definitive predictions of future events.",
        "Tarot readings should emphasize possibilities and potential outcomes influenced by the client's choices, rather than fixed predictions.",
        "It is ethical to make predictions as long as the reader is confident in their abilities.",
        "Clients prefer definitive predictions, so readers should provide them regardless of ethical considerations."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ethically, Tarot readings should focus on possibilities and client agency rather than deterministic predictions. This approach respects the client's free will and potential to shape their future."

        "Guidance provides specific steps to follow, while instruction offers general insights.",
        "Guidance empowers the client to make their own decisions, while instruction dictates a course of action.",
        "There is no real difference; the terms can be used interchangeably.",
        "Instruction is more effective because it provides clear direction."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Guidance aims to empower clients by providing insights and options, whereas instruction directs them towards a specific path, potentially undermining their autonomy."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "All options are important boundaries. Avoiding sensitive topics and limiting reading time are valuable, but defining the reader's role as a guide and not an expert in unrelated fields is crucial for ethical and empowering readings."
