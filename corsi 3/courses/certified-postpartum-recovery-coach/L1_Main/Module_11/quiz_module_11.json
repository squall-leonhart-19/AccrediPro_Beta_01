            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective advanced nutrition strategy for addressing postpartum hair loss, considering the role of micronutrients?",
            "options": ["Increasing simple carbohydrate intake.", "Supplementing with high doses of Vitamin C alone.", "Prioritizing iron-rich foods and ensuring adequate zinc and biotin intake.", "Restricting fat intake to promote detoxification."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postpartum hair loss is often linked to micronutrient deficiencies. Iron, zinc, and biotin play crucial roles in hair follicle health. A balanced approach focusing on these nutrients is more effective than isolated supplementation or restrictive diets."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, 6 weeks postpartum, reports persistent sleep disturbances despite following basic sleep hygiene. Which advanced restorative practice would be MOST appropriate to recommend FIRST?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MBSR techniques, particularly body scan meditations, have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing sleep disturbances by addressing underlying stress and promoting relaxation without disrupting sleep cycles.

            "question": "A postpartum client is experiencing persistent perineal pain despite using ice packs and over-the-counter pain relievers. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate to suggest NEXT?",
            "options": ["Recommend a hot bath with Epsom salts and essential oils.", "Suggest she discontinue all pain management techniques to avoid dependency.", "Refer her to a pelvic floor physiotherapist for assessment and treatment.", "Advise her to increase her activity level to 'walk it off'."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Persistent pain warrants professional evaluation. A pelvic floor physiotherapist can assess for underlying issues like muscle spasms or nerve damage and provide targeted treatment. Ignoring the pain or attempting to self-treat may delay recovery and potentially worsen the condition."

By helping the partner understand the client's needs and providing practical support strategies, the coach can foster a more collaborative and supportive environment. A study by Goodman (2005) highlighted the importance of partner support in postpartum mental health."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gradual return to running is crucial to avoid injury. Starting with walking and light jogging allows the body to adapt and rebuild strength.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Lifestyle' element encompasses social connections, hobbies, and routines. Joining a mom's group directly addresses Maria's feelings of isolation by fostering social interaction and support, which is a key aspect of a healthy lifestyle. The other options address other elements of the framework, but not Lifestyle most directly."
