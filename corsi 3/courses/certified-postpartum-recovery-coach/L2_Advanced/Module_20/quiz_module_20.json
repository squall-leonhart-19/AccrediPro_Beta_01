            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The EPDS is specifically designed as a screening tool for postpartum depression, not other disorders, although anxiety can be a component."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client scores 15 on the EPDS. According to standard guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Reassure her that she is likely just experiencing normal postpartum emotions.", "Immediately refer her to a psychiatrist for medication.", "Suggest she retake the test in a week.", "Refer her to a mental health professional for a comprehensive evaluation."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A score of 13 or higher on the EPDS typically warrants referral for a more in-depth evaluation to determine the presence and severity of postpartum depression."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key aspect assessed by the GAD-7?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "What is a key limitation of relying solely on self-report questionnaires for assessing maternal-infant bonding?",
            "options": ["They are too expensive to administer.", "They are not standardized across different cultures.", "They can be influenced by social desirability bias.", "They take too long to complete."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Self-report measures can be affected by social desirability bias, where individuals may underreport negative feelings or behaviors to present themselves in a more favorable light."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "During a physical assessment, you observe a 3-finger width separation along the linea alba when a client performs a curl-up. This indicates:",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A separation of more than 2 finger-widths is typically considered diastasis recti. Three fingers indicates a mild case. Surgery is rarely the first line of treatment."

            "options": ["Directly translating the tool into the target language.", "Ensuring the tool has been validated for use in that specific cultural context.", "Using the tool regardless of its cultural validity to maintain consistency.", "Administering the tool only to individuals who are proficient in the original language."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural validation is crucial to ensure the tool accurately measures the intended construct within that cultural context and avoids misinterpretation or bias. Direct translation is not enough."

            "options": ["Focus solely on abdominal strengthening exercises.", "Immediately implement a strict sleep training program for her baby.", "Prioritize addressing her mental health concerns and refer for specialized care if needed.", "Recommend a high-intensity workout program to combat fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the high scores on the EPDS and GAD-7, addressing Sarah's mental health is the priority. Postpartum mental health issues can significantly impact other areas of recovery."
