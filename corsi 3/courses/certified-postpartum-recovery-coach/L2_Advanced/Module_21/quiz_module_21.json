            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "According to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), what score generally indicates the need for further assessment for postpartum depression?",
            "options": ["A score of 5 or less.", "A score of 10 or greater.", "A score of 13 or greater.", "Any score above 0."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adapting the treatment plan to be more realistic and achievable is crucial when a client is not making progress towards their initial goals. Exploring potential barriers can help identify factors that are hindering progress."
