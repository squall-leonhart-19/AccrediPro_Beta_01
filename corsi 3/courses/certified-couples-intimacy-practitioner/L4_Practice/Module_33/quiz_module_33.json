            "question": "Informed consent in couples intimacy work requires which of the following elements?",
            "options": ["A detailed explanation of the practitioner's qualifications.", "A clear description of the techniques and approaches used, potential risks, and benefits.", "A guarantee of successful outcomes.", "A statement that the practitioner is not liable for any emotional distress experienced by the clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent mandates a comprehensive overview of the process, including techniques, potential risks, and benefits, allowing clients to make an informed decision about participation. Guaranteeing outcomes or disclaiming liability are unethical and legally unsound."

            "id": "q33_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of confidentiality, when can a couples intimacy practitioner ethically and legally disclose client information without explicit consent?",
            "options": ["When the practitioner believes it is in the best interest of the couple.", "When the practitioner is subpoenaed by a court of law.", "When the practitioner wants to discuss the case with a supervisor.", "When the practitioner suspects one partner is being dishonest."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality is paramount, but legal obligations, such as a court subpoena or mandated reporting of abuse, can override it. Disclosing information based on personal beliefs or suspicions is unethical and potentially illegal."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical advertising demands honesty and accuracy. Guaranteeing results or using testimonials without consent are misleading and violate ethical guidelines. Emphasizing only dramatic successes can create unrealistic expectations."

            "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of maintaining accurate and thorough records in a couples intimacy practice?",

            "options": ["Providing education on healthy relationship dynamics.", "Facilitating communication skills training.", "Diagnosing and treating mental health disorders.", "Offering guidance on sexual wellness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

Offering education, facilitating communication, and providing sexual wellness guidance may fall within a different scope, depending on training and qualifications."

            "id": "q33_6",
            "question": "When billing insurance for couples intimacy services, what is a crucial consideration?",
            "options": ["Always using the highest reimbursable code, regardless of the service provided.", "Ensuring that the services provided are accurately represented by the billing codes used.", "Billing each partner separately for individual sessions, even if the session was conducted jointly.", "Waiving co-pays for clients who are experiencing financial hardship without documenting it."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accurate billing is essential for ethical and legal compliance. Using appropriate codes, even if they are not the highest reimbursable, is crucial. Billing for individual sessions when the service was couples-based or waiving co-pays without documentation constitutes fraud."

            "id": "q33_8",

            "explanation": "The practitioner has a duty to prioritize the client's safety and well-being. Addressing suicidal ideation requires immediate intervention, including assessing the severity of the risk, implementing safety measures, and facilitating access to appropriate mental health services.
