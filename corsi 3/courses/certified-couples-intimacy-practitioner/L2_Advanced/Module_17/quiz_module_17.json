            "question": "In cases of infidelity, what is the FIRST and MOST crucial step in rebuilding trust?",
            "options": ["Full disclosure of all details of the affair.", "Mutual agreement to forgive and forget the past.", "The unfaithful partner taking full responsibility for their actions.", "Couple's therapy to address underlying issues."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Taking full responsibility is crucial as it demonstrates remorse and sets the foundation for rebuilding trust. Without it, other steps will be less effective. A 2017 study in the Journal of Family Psychology found that couples who engaged in complete and honest disclosure, coupled with accepting responsibility, reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction post-infidelity."

            "question": "When working with a couple where one partner has a chronic illness, what is the MOST important aspect of the therapist's role?",
            "options": ["Providing medical advice and treatment options.", "Facilitating open communication about the impact of the illness on the relationship.", "Encouraging the healthy partner to take on a caregiver role.", "Focusing on the ill partner's individual needs exclusively."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Open communication is critical.

            "question": "In situations involving significant power imbalances within a couple, what is the PRIMARY goal of therapeutic intervention?",
            "options": ["Assigning equal roles and responsibilities to each partner.", "Helping the dominant partner relinquish control.", "Empowering the less powerful partner to assert their needs and boundaries.", "Mediating compromises between the partners' desires."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering the less powerful partner to assert their needs and boundaries is the most important step. While addressing the dominant partner's behavior is also necessary, ensuring the less powerful partner feels safe and able to advocate for themselves is paramount. Research in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence (2019) indicates that interventions focused on empowerment significantly reduce relationship distress in imbalanced relationships."

            "question": "A couple, Sarah (32) and Mark (35), are experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss. Sarah is increasingly withdrawn and anxious, while Mark focuses on practical solutions. What intervention would be MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Suggesting they immediately pursue IVF.", "Encouraging individual therapy for both partners to process their grief.", "Recommending a support group for couples experiencing pregnancy loss.", "Focusing on their communication patterns and emotional support for each other."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Focusing on communication and emotional support is the most appropriate initial intervention. Pregnancy loss is a shared trauma, and strengthening their emotional connection is crucial. Individual therapy and support groups can be beneficial later, but addressing their immediate needs for mutual support is paramount. A 2021 meta-analysis in 'Human Reproduction Update' highlighted the importance of relational support in mitigating the psychological impact of pregnancy loss."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "When a couple's intimacy is affected by differing cultural beliefs about sex and relationships, what is a crucial step in the therapeutic process?",
            "options": ["Encouraging one partner to adopt the other's cultural beliefs.", "Avoiding discussion of cultural differences to prevent conflict.", "Exploring each partner's cultural values and beliefs in a non-judgmental manner.", "Providing education on the 'correct' cultural approach to intimacy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring cultural values without judgment is essential. Understanding each partner's background and how it shapes their expectations of intimacy is the first step. A 2018 study in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy showed that couples who successfully navigate cultural differences do so by developing a shared understanding and respect for each other's beliefs."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "If one partner in a couple has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which therapeutic approach is MOST likely to be beneficial for the couple?",
            "options": ["Exposure therapy.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focused solely on the partner with BPD.", "Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills training for both partners.", "Psychodynamic therapy focused on childhood trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DBT skills training for both partners is likely the most beneficial. BPD significantly impacts relationships, and DBT provides tools for emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. In a 2022 study published in 'Behavior Therapy', couples where one partner received DBT reported significant improvements in relationship satisfaction and communication."

            "question": "In couples where one partner is in recovery from addiction, what is a critical factor in maintaining intimacy and preventing relapse?",
            "options": ["Enabling behaviors that minimize conflict.", "Complete avoidance of any discussion about the addiction.", "Open communication and a strong support system.", "Ignoring any signs of potential relapse to avoid triggering the recovering partner."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Open communication and a strong support system are crucial. Honesty, transparency, and mutual support are essential for maintaining sobriety and rebuilding trust.

            "question": "What is the MOST important ethical consideration when working with couples in complex scenarios?",
            "options": ["Maintaining absolute confidentiality, even if it puts one partner at risk.", "Prioritizing the therapist's personal values and beliefs.", "Ensuring the safety and well-being of all individuals involved.", "Focusing solely on the needs of the couple as a unit."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ensuring the safety and well-being of all individuals is paramount. This includes assessing for domestic violence, child abuse, and other potential risks. The therapist has a responsibility to protect all parties involved, even if it means breaking confidentiality in certain circumstances. Standard ethical guidelines from the APA and AAMFT prioritize client safety."

            "question": "A couple, Maria (40) and David (42), are seeking therapy because David has recently been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. What is the MOST appropriate initial focus of therapy?",
            "options": ["Encouraging Maria to immediately start making end-of-life care decisions for David.", "Helping them explore their fears and anxieties about the future and adapt to changing roles and responsibilities.", "Recommending that David be placed in a specialized care facility.", "Focusing on preserving David's cognitive abilities through intensive memory exercises."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Helping them explore their fears and adapt to changing roles is crucial. Alzheimer's significantly alters the relationship dynamics, and addressing their emotional needs is paramount. While practical planning is important, the initial focus should be on emotional support and adaptation. A 2023 review in 'The Gerontologist' emphasized the importance of couple-based interventions in managing the emotional and relational challenges of early-onset dementia."
