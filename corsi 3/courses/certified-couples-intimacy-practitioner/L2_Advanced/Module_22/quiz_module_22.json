            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "A therapist begins individual therapy with one member of a couple. Later, the couple requests couples therapy with the same therapist. What is the primary ethical consideration?",
            "options": ["Ensuring adequate insurance coverage for both individual and couples therapy.", "Avoiding a dual relationship and potential conflicts of interest.", "Determining which partner is the 'primary' client.", "Guaranteeing equal time allocation for each partner in therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beginning individual therapy with one partner and then transitioning to couples therapy with the same therapist creates a dual relationship that can compromise objectivity and lead to conflicts of interest. It's crucial to address this potential conflict proactively."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "According to the principles of confidentiality, under what circumstance is a therapist ethically REQUIRED to break confidentiality in couples therapy?",
            "options": ["When one partner admits to infidelity.", "When one partner discloses past criminal activity.", "When there is a reasonable suspicion of ongoing domestic violence or intent to harm another person.", "When one partner expresses dissatisfaction with the therapeutic process."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The duty to protect (Tarasoff ruling extensions) necessitates breaking confidentiality when there is a credible threat of harm to self or others. This supersedes the general rule of confidentiality to ensure safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Informed consent in couples therapy should include information about:",
            "options": ["The therapist's personal relationship history.", "The specific techniques that will be used in therapy.", "The limits of confidentiality and potential conflicts of interest.", "The billing policies and procedures, and the therapist's theoretical orientation.", "All of the above, except the therapist's personal relationship history."],
            "correctAnswer": 4,
            "explanation": "Informed consent should cover the nature of therapy, potential risks and benefits, confidentiality limits, therapist qualifications, and financial arrangements. The therapist's personal relationship history is irrelevant and inappropriate."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A therapist is working with a couple where one partner is struggling with severe depression. The therapist has limited experience treating depression. What is the most ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue treating the couple while researching depression in their spare time.", "Refer the depressed partner to an individual therapist specializing in depression while continuing to see the couple for couples therapy.", "Terminate couples therapy and refer the couple to a therapist with expertise in depression.", "Only address the relational aspects of the depression and avoid discussing the depression itself."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining competence requires recognizing limitations and seeking appropriate consultation or referral. Referring the individual partner to a specialist ensures they receive the necessary care for their depression, while the couples therapy can continue to address relational issues."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Countertransference refers to the therapist's unconscious emotional reactions to the client(s). Recognizing and managing countertransference is crucial for maintaining objectivity and providing effective therapy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While researching and consulting are helpful, the most ethical course is to refer to a specialist. This ensures the couple receives culturally competent care addressing the specific challenges related to internalized homophobia within their relationship context."
