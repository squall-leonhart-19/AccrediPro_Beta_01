            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective active listening technique for understanding a partner's emotional state?",
            "options": ["Interrupting to offer solutions", "Repeating their words verbatim without inflection", "Using open-ended questions and reflecting back their feelings", "Minimizing their feelings to avoid conflict"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions and reflective responding demonstrate empathy and encourage the speaker to elaborate, fostering deeper understanding. Studies show that perceived empathy significantly improves relationship satisfaction."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to Gottman's research, what is the 'magic ratio' of positive to negative interactions that predicts marital stability?",
            "options": ["1:1", "3:1", "5:1", "10:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gottman's research indicates that a ratio of 5 positive interactions for every 1 negative interaction is a strong predictor of a stable and happy marriage. Falling below this ratio increases the likelihood of divorce."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports feeling anxious and avoidant in her relationship. Which attachment style is MOST likely influencing her behavior?",
            "options": ["Secure", "Anxious-Preoccupied", "Dismissive-Avoidant", "Fearful-Avoidant"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fearful-avoidant attachment is characterized by a desire for intimacy coupled with a fear of rejection, leading to both anxiety and avoidance in relationships. This often stems from past experiences of trauma or inconsistent caregiving."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which sensory experience is LEAST likely to heighten intimacy when exploring sensuality beyond sexuality?",
            "options": ["Sharing a favorite meal together", "Engaging in a deep conversation about childhood experiences", "Listening to a guided meditation focusing on self-love", "Watching television passively in separate rooms"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Passive television watching promotes disconnection and lacks the shared experience and focused attention necessary to enhance intimacy through the senses. The other options actively engage the senses and foster connection."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A couple is struggling with mismatched sexual desire. What is the FIRST step you should take as a Certified Couples Intimacy Practitioner?",
            "options": ["Suggest they try new sexual positions", "Explore the underlying reasons for the discrepancy in desire", "Recommend a sex therapist immediately", "Prescribe medication to increase libido"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to understand the root causes of the desire discrepancy before suggesting solutions. These causes can be psychological, physiological, relational, or situational. Addressing the underlying issues is more effective than simply treating the symptom."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "According to the TRUST framework, which element focuses on creating a safe and supportive environment for vulnerability?",
            "options": ["Transparency", "Respect", "Understanding", "Trustworthiness"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Trustworthiness involves demonstrating reliability, consistency, and ethical behavior, which creates a foundation of safety and allows partners to be more vulnerable with each other. Without perceived trustworthiness, vulnerability is risky."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "When working with a couple where one partner has a history of trauma, what is the MOST important consideration for creating a safe therapeutic environment?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to immediately confront the traumatic memories", "Avoiding any discussion of the trauma to prevent triggering", "Establishing clear boundaries and empowering the survivor to control the pace of disclosure", "Focusing solely on the relationship dynamics and ignoring the individual's trauma history"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empowering the survivor to control the pace of disclosure and establishing clear boundaries are crucial for creating a safe and therapeutic environment. Re-traumatization can occur if the process is rushed or the survivor feels pressured."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of incorporating 'rituals of connection' into a long-term relationship?",
            "options": ["Eliminating conflict entirely", "Creating predictable routines that stifle spontaneity", "Maintaining a sense of closeness and predictability", "Guaranteeing sexual satisfaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rituals of connection, such as regular date nights or morning coffee together, help maintain a sense of closeness, predictability, and shared meaning in long-term relationships, counteracting the effects of habituation and life stressors. A 2017 study found that couples who engage in consistent rituals report higher levels of relationship satisfaction (Johnson et al., 2017)."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Client John discloses that he shuts down emotionally during conflict to avoid arguments. This behavior is an example of which conflict style?",
            "options": ["Validating", "Volatile", "Avoidant", "Hostile"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An avoidant conflict style is characterized by minimizing conflict and withdrawing emotionally, often due to a fear of confrontation or emotional intensity. While avoidance can prevent immediate escalation, it can also lead to unresolved issues and emotional distance over time."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Teaching active listening and reflective responding provides practical communication tools to improve their interaction patterns in session and at home. This is a foundational step before addressing deeper emotional issues. A 2021 meta-analysis showed that couples who learned active listening skills experienced a 20% reduction in conflict frequency (n=3200, CI 95%)."
