 <h2 id="welcome">A Warm Welcome From Sarah</h2>
 <p>Hi, I'm Sarah, and I am <em>SO</em> incredibly excited you're here! Welcome to the Certified Couples Intimacy Practitioner™ program. This isn't just another course; it's a doorway to a fulfilling career where you get to help people build deeper, more meaningful connections, all while creating a life of freedom and financial security for yourself.</p>

 <p>My own journey to becoming a couples intimacy practitioner wasn't exactly a straight line. For years, I felt this pull to do something more meaningful, something that truly aligned with my values of connection, empathy, and growth. I explored different avenues, but nothing quite clicked until I discovered the power of intimacy coaching. </p>

 <p>Seeing couples transform their relationships, rediscover their passion, and build a stronger foundation of love lit a fire in me. I knew I had to share this work with others, and that's why I created this program. I wanted to build a comprehensive, accessible, and empowering certification that would equip women like you with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to thrive in this rewarding field. I poured my heart and soul into crafting a curriculum that blends proven methodologies with practical tools and real-world strategies.</p>

 <p>This program is designed to be more than just a certification; it's a <span class="highlight">transformation</span>. It's about stepping into your power, embracing your unique gifts, and becoming the confident, compassionate practitioner you were always meant to be. I want you to know that I believe in you. I believe in your ability to make a profound difference in the lives of others, and I'm honored to be a part of your journey.</p>

 <h2 id="youbelong">You Belong Here: The "Am I Too Old?" Question</h2>
 <p>Let's address something right away: imposter syndrome. It's that little voice that whispers, "Am I good enough? Am I experienced enough? Am I too old to start something new?" If that voice is speaking to you, I want you to silence it right now.</p>

 <p>If you're in your 40s, 50s, or beyond – you're <span class="highlight">exactly</span> who we need. Your life experience is your superpower. You bring a wealth of wisdom, empathy, and perspective that younger practitioners simply can't match. You've navigated relationships, career changes, family challenges, and personal growth. You understand the complexities of life, and that makes you uniquely qualified to guide others.</p>

 <p>Don't let age be a barrier. Let it be your strength. Here's a case study to inspire you:</p>

 <h4>Sarah M.</h4>
 <p>52, Former Nurse</p>

Despite her initial fears about starting a new career in her 50s, she enrolled in the Certified Couples Intimacy Practitioner™ program.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Intervention:</strong> Sarah embraced the training, leveraging her existing skills in empathy and communication. She excelled in the practical application exercises and actively participated in the community forum.</li>
 <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Within six months of graduating, Sarah launched her own successful intimacy coaching practice.
