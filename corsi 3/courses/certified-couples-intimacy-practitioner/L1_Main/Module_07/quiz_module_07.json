            "options": ["Transparency & Truth", "Respect & Responsiveness", "Understanding & Unveiling", "Transformation & Togetherness"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Transparency & Truth emphasizes radical honesty and openness, which fosters a safe space for vulnerability. This aligns with research showing that couples who are more transparent with each other report higher levels of relationship satisfaction (Sahlstein, 2004)."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently interrupts her partner, Mark, during sessions. According to the module on Respect & Responsiveness, which active listening technique would be MOST effective in addressing this behavior?",
            "options": ["Advising Sarah to let Mark speak more often.", "Using reflective listening to mirror Mark's feelings when he expresses frustration.", "Ignoring the interruptions to avoid conflict.", "Analyzing Sarah's attachment style to understand her need for control."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening involves mirroring the speaker's emotions and content, demonstrating that you are hearing and understanding them. This is a core component of Respect & Responsiveness and can help Sarah recognize the impact of her interruptions on Mark."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dismissive-avoidant attachment is marked by a high need for independence and a discomfort with closeness. Individuals with this style tend to suppress their emotions and may devalue relationships. According to Bartholomew & Horowitz (1991), dismissive-avoidant individuals have a positive view of themselves but a negative view of others."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Open communication is crucial in addressing changes in intimacy after childbirth. Exploring new ways to connect physically, considering the constraints of parenthood, allows the couple to redefine their sexual relationship. A study by Doss et al. (2011) found that couples who communicate effectively about sex have higher relationship satisfaction."

            "explanation": "Transformation & Togetherness emphasizes interdependence and mutual support, not rigid boundaries. It focuses on creating a shared vision for the future and fostering a sense of 'we-ness' while still respecting individual identities. Research indicates that couples with a strong sense of togetherness report higher levels of marital satisfaction (Finkel et al., 2013)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transparency & Truth is paramount in rebuilding trust after infidelity. Open and honest communication about the affair, its causes, and the impact on both partners is essential for healing. According to research by Atkins et al.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist's primary ethical responsibility is to ensure the safety and well-being of all clients.

The ACA Code of Ethics emphasizes the importance of client welfare."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Attachment styles, formed in early childhood, can significantly influence how individuals approach relationships, but they are not fixed. Through self-awareness, therapy, and conscious effort, individuals can develop more secure attachment patterns. Research by Mikulincer & Shaver (2016) demonstrates the plasticity of attachment styles."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A couple expresses difficulty initiating sexual intimacy. Which 'Sensuality & Sexuality' technique would be MOST appropriate to suggest as a starting point?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting with non-demanding touch and affection can help reduce anxiety and build a sense of safety and connection. This approach aligns with sensate focus principles and allows the couple to gradually rebuild their sexual intimacy without pressure. Research suggests that couples who prioritize non-sexual touch have higher levels of relationship satisfaction (Gottman & Silver, 1999)."
