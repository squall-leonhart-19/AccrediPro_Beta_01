            "question": "Which of the following is an example of 'banking time' in advanced activity pacing for a client with fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Scheduling all demanding activities for the morning when energy is typically higher.", "Consistently exceeding daily activity limits to build tolerance over time.", "Reducing activity levels below the perceived capacity on good days to create an energy reserve.", "Avoiding all physical activity to prevent symptom exacerbation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'Banking time' involves strategically conserving energy on good days to offset potential overexertion and symptom flares on more challenging days, as discussed in the activity pacing strategies."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to research presented in the Mindfulness-Based Interventions lesson, what is the primary mechanism by which mindfulness practices reduce pain perception in individuals with fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Increasing the production of endorphins.", "Reducing inflammation in the peripheral nervous system.", "Altering the cognitive appraisal of pain sensations and increasing acceptance.", "Blocking pain signals from reaching the brain."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness-Based Interventions primarily work by helping individuals to change their relationship with pain, increasing acceptance and altering the cognitive appraisal of pain sensations, rather than directly affecting physiological pain pathways."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia is exploring dietary changes to manage their symptoms. Considering the 'beyond the basics' nutritional strategies, which of the following approaches is MOST likely to be beneficial?",
            "options": ["Following a strict ketogenic diet with high fat intake.", "Implementing a personalized elimination diet to identify food sensitivities.", "Consuming large doses of vitamin supplements without medical supervision.", "Adopting a highly restrictive calorie-counting approach."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personalized elimination diets, guided by a healthcare professional, can help identify specific food sensitivities that may be contributing to inflammation and symptom exacerbation in some individuals with fibromyalgia. The other options can be harmful without proper guidance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring involves identifying, challenging, and modifying negative or unhelpful thought patterns that contribute to emotional distress and symptom perception in individuals with fibromyalgia. This technique is rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a goal to be achievable, it must be realistic and attainable given the client's current physical and emotional state, available support, and potential limitations imposed by fibromyalgia. Unrealistic goals can lead to frustration and discouragement."
