            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia reports persistent insomnia despite following basic sleep hygiene. Which advanced strategy should be prioritized FIRST?",
            "options": ["Implementing a strict light exposure schedule and blue light blocking glasses.", "Recommending a sleep study to rule out underlying sleep disorders.", "Initiating a short course of melatonin supplementation.", "Exploring Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "CBT-I is the recommended first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. Addressing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors related to sleep is often more effective than solely relying on sleep hygiene or supplements. A sleep study is warranted if CBT-I is ineffective or if there are clinical indicators of other sleep disorders."

            "question": "According to the personalized exercise programming module, what is the MOST appropriate initial exercise prescription for a fibromyalgia patient who is currently sedentary and experiencing high levels of pain?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed 3 times per week.", "Daily brisk walking for 30 minutes.", "A gentle, low-impact program focusing on range of motion and flexibility, progressing gradually.", "Resistance training with heavy weights to build muscle strength."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The initial focus should be on gentle, low-impact activities to minimize pain exacerbation and promote adherence. Gradual progression is key. HIIT and high-intensity resistance training are generally not appropriate for initial exercise prescriptions in sedentary individuals with high pain levels."

            "question": "A fibromyalgia patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, and gastrointestinal distress. Which nutritional intervention should be explored FIRST, considering potential underlying mechanisms?",
            "options": ["Initiating a ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation.", "Supplementing with high doses of Vitamin D.", "Evaluating for food sensitivities or intolerances through an elimination diet.", "Recommending a high-protein diet to improve energy levels."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gastrointestinal issues are common in fibromyalgia, and food sensitivities can exacerbate symptoms. An elimination diet helps identify potential trigger foods. While other interventions may be helpful, addressing potential food sensitivities is often a crucial first step."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which mindfulness technique is MOST specifically designed to address and reduce the intensity of chronic pain sensations?",
            "options": ["Loving-kindness meditation.", "Body scan meditation.", "Mindful breathing exercises.", "Open monitoring meditation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body scan meditation involves systematically bringing awareness to different parts of the body, noticing sensations without judgment. This can help individuals become more aware of and accepting of pain sensations, potentially reducing their perceived intensity."

            "question": "In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for fibromyalgia, what is the primary goal of cognitive restructuring?",
            "options": ["To improve physical functioning through graded exercise.", "To identify and modify maladaptive thoughts and beliefs that contribute to pain and distress.", "To teach relaxation techniques for managing stress.", "To promote social support and reduce isolation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring focuses on identifying and challenging negative or unhelpful thoughts that exacerbate pain and emotional distress. By modifying these thoughts, patients can develop more adaptive coping strategies."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "A fibromyalgia patient consistently reports feeling overwhelmed and hopeless due to their chronic pain. Which resilience-building strategy would be MOST appropriate to address these feelings?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the patient to avoid social interactions to conserve energy.", "Helping the patient identify and cultivate their personal strengths and values.", "Recommending complete bed rest to reduce physical strain.", "Focusing solely on pain management techniques to eliminate discomfort."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on strengths and values helps individuals find meaning and purpose despite their pain, fostering a sense of control and hope. Isolation and avoidance can worsen feelings of helplessness. Complete bed rest is generally not recommended."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "A fibromyalgia patient is struggling to obtain appropriate medical care due to a lack of understanding from their primary care physician. What is the MOST effective advocacy strategy you can recommend?",
            "options": ["Advising the patient to switch to a new primary care physician immediately.", "Encouraging the patient to become confrontational with their physician to demand better care.", "Helping the patient prepare a detailed summary of their symptoms, medical history, and treatment goals, along with relevant research articles.", "Recommending the patient discontinue all medical treatment and rely solely on alternative therapies."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing clear, concise information and research to the physician can help improve understanding and facilitate better communication. A collaborative approach is generally more effective than confrontation. Switching physicians may be necessary, but should be considered after attempting to educate the current physician."

            "question": "A practitioner is considering recommending a treatment for fibromyalgia that is outside of their established scope of practice. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Proceed with the treatment if the practitioner believes it will benefit the patient.", "Obtain appropriate training and supervision before offering the treatment.", "Refer the patient to another qualified professional who specializes in that treatment.", "Disclose the limitations to the patient, but continue with the treatment if the patient insists."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Practitioners should only offer treatments within their scope of practice and competence. Referring to a qualified professional ensures the patient receives appropriate and safe care. Obtaining training is an option, but should precede offering the treatment."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 45-year-old with fibromyalgia, reports significant sleep disturbance and daytime fatigue. She has tried basic sleep hygiene measures with limited success. Considering the advanced sleep hygiene strategies, which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a strong sedative medication.", "Implementing a strict, timed light exposure protocol, including blue-light blocking glasses in the evening.", "Recommending a sleep study to immediately rule out any sleep disorders.", "Referring Sarah for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "CBT-I is considered a first-line treatment for insomnia and addresses the psychological and behavioral factors contributing to sleep disturbance. While light exposure and sleep studies may be helpful, CBT-I should be prioritized. Sedatives should be considered only after other options have been exhausted."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis indicated that mindfulness-based interventions showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.52, 95% CI [0.31, 0.73])</span> in reducing pain intensity in fibromyalgia patients. Which of the following statements BEST interprets this finding?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness interventions are ineffective for pain management in fibromyalgia.", "Mindfulness interventions have a small but statistically insignificant effect on pain intensity.", "Mindfulness interventions are likely to produce a noticeable and clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity for many fibromyalgia patients.", "The confidence interval indicates that the true effect size could be zero, suggesting no real benefit."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A moderate effect size suggests a noticeable and clinically meaningful benefit. The confidence interval does not include zero, indicating that the effect is statistically significant. Therefore, mindfulness interventions are likely to be helpful for many fibromyalgia patients with fibromyalgia."
