            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial consideration when setting achievable goals with a fibromyalgia client?",
            "options": ["Focusing on long-term aspirations immediately.", "Prioritizing activities that cause the most pain.", "Establishing a baseline of current functional capacity.", "Encouraging immediate engagement in all previously enjoyed activities."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing a baseline of current functional capacity is crucial for setting realistic and achievable goals. This prevents overexertion and potential setbacks, aligning with the principles of pacing and energy conservation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Breaking chores into smaller segments with rest periods is a key pacing strategy. This approach helps to manage energy expenditure and minimize the risk of triggering PEM, a hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia."

            "question": "Which adaptive strategy would be MOST beneficial for a fibromyalgia client who experiences significant pain and fatigue while preparing meals?",
            "options": ["Standing for extended periods to improve balance.", "Using lightweight kitchen tools and sitting while preparing food.", "Preparing elaborate meals to stimulate appetite.", "Avoiding meal preparation altogether and relying on pre-packaged foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using lightweight tools and sitting while preparing food reduces physical strain and conserves energy. This adaptive strategy allows the client to maintain independence in meal preparation while minimizing pain and fatigue."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 50-60% of individuals with fibromyalgia report experiencing social isolation due to pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that limit their ability to participate in social activities."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A fibromyalgia client expresses a desire to return to gardening, a previously enjoyed hobby, but is limited by pain and fatigue. What is the MOST appropriate initial step to facilitate this return?",
            "options": ["Immediately resuming gardening at the previous level of activity.", "Starting with small, modified gardening tasks and gradually increasing activity as tolerated.", "Avoiding gardening altogether to prevent symptom exacerbation.", "Focusing solely on indoor activities instead."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with small, modified tasks and gradually increasing activity aligns with the principles of pacing and graded exposure. This approach allows the client to re-engage in a meaningful activity while minimizing the risk of symptom flare-ups."
