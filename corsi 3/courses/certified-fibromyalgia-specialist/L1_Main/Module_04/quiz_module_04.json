            "question": "Which of the following is a core principle of mindfulness-based interventions for fibromyalgia, aimed at altering the patient's relationship with pain?",
            "options": ["Complete pain elimination through distraction", "Aggressive confrontation of pain sensations", "Non-judgmental observation of pain sensations", "Ignoring pain signals to promote activity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness-based interventions emphasize non-judgmental observation of pain sensations, fostering acceptance and reducing emotional reactivity to pain, which can decrease overall suffering. This aligns with studies showing improved pain acceptance and reduced catastrophizing."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client with fibromyalgia reports significant muscle stiffness and limited range of motion. Which gentle yoga style would be MOST appropriate as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Ashtanga Yoga", "Bikram Yoga", "Restorative Yoga", "Power Yoga"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restorative yoga is characterized by passive poses held for longer durations with the support of props, promoting relaxation and gentle stretching suitable for individuals with fibromyalgia experiencing muscle stiffness and pain sensitivity. Ashtanga, Bikram, and Power Yoga are generally too strenuous."

            "question": "According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), fibromyalgia is often attributed to stagnation of which vital energy?",
            "options": ["Jing", "Qi", "Shen", "Xue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In TCM, fibromyalgia is often linked to Qi stagnation, leading to pain, fatigue, and other symptoms. Acupuncture aims to restore the flow of Qi to alleviate these imbalances. Jing, Shen, and Xue represent other vital substances but are less directly associated with the widespread pain of fibromyalgia."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which type of massage therapy is specifically designed to release chronic patterns of tension in the body through slow strokes and deep finger pressure on contracted areas?",
            "options": ["Swedish Massage", "Deep Tissue Massage", "Shiatsu Massage", "Sports Massage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep tissue massage focuses on realigning deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue, making it effective for addressing chronic muscle tension and pain associated with fibromyalgia. While Swedish massage is relaxing, it doesn't target deep-seated tension as effectively."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia is considering dietary changes. Which dietary approach has shown promise in reducing inflammation and pain, supported by a 2017 study in 'Nutrients'?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate diet", "Ketogenic diet", "Mediterranean diet", "Vegan diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects and potential benefits for fibromyalgia symptoms. The 2017 study in 'Nutrients' supports this, suggesting that adopting a Mediterranean diet can lead to improvements in pain and overall well-being."

            "question": "Which herbal supplement has demonstrated potential benefits for improving sleep quality and reducing anxiety in individuals with fibromyalgia, as indicated by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials?",
            "options": ["Ginseng", "St. John's Wort", "Valerian Root", "Ginkgo Biloba"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Valerian root has been shown to have sedative and anxiolytic properties, which can improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety in fibromyalgia patients. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials support the use of valerian root for these purposes. Ginseng, St. John's Wort, and Ginkgo Biloba are used for other conditions."

            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "A 52-year-old woman with fibromyalgia presents with widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction ('fibro fog'). After discussing her symptoms and preferences, you recommend an integrative treatment plan that includes mindfulness meditation, gentle yoga, and acupuncture. What is the MOST important next step in implementing this plan?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting all interventions simultaneously", "Establishing realistic goals and a gradual implementation schedule", "Prescribing high doses of herbal supplements for immediate relief", "Focusing solely on the most painful areas with aggressive massage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing realistic goals and a gradual implementation schedule is crucial for adherence and success. Overwhelming the client with multiple interventions simultaneously can lead to frustration and dropout. A phased approach allows for monitoring individual responses and tailoring the plan accordingly."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key consideration when integrating nutritional interventions into a comprehensive fibromyalgia treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Recommending a one-size-fits-all diet for all patients", "Ignoring potential interactions between dietary changes and medications", "Addressing individual sensitivities and potential nutrient deficiencies", "Promoting rapid weight loss as the primary goal"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing individual sensitivities and potential nutrient deficiencies is crucial, as fibromyalgia patients often have unique dietary needs and sensitivities. A personalized approach ensures that dietary changes are safe, effective, and tailored to the individual's specific health profile. Ignoring interactions or promoting rapid weight loss can be detrimental."

            "question": "A client reports that their fibromyalgia symptoms significantly worsen after consuming foods containing artificial sweeteners. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminate all carbohydrates from their diet", "Encourage them to ignore the symptoms as they are likely psychosomatic", "Advise them to keep a food diary to track symptoms and identify potential triggers", "Immediately start a course of antibiotics to address gut bacteria imbalances"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Keeping a food diary is the most appropriate initial recommendation. It allows the client to track their symptoms in relation to food intake, helping to identify specific triggers and patterns. This information can then be used to guide dietary modifications in a more targeted and effective manner."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrative interventions are most effective when used in conjunction with conventional medical treatments to address the complex interplay of physical, psychological, and lifestyle factors contributing to fibromyalgia. They are not a replacement for conventional care but rather a complementary approach."
