            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY principle of advanced myofascial release (MFR) techniques, beyond basic techniques?",
            "options": ["Applying rapid, forceful pressure to trigger points.", "Ignoring the client's pain response to deepen the release.", "Utilizing sustained pressure combined with movement and client participation.", "Focusing solely on the area of reported pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced MFR emphasizes gentle, sustained pressure combined with client movement and active participation to facilitate release, rather than forceful techniques."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to the Energy Envelope Theory, what is the PRIMARY goal of advanced pacing strategies for individuals with fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Pushing through fatigue to increase activity levels quickly.", "Staying within the limits of available energy to prevent symptom exacerbation.", "Completely avoiding activities that trigger pain or fatigue.", "Focusing only on rest and avoiding any physical exertion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Energy Envelope Theory emphasizes staying within one's 'energy envelope' to avoid post-exertional malaise and symptom flares, promoting sustainable activity management."

            "question": "In advanced CBT for fibromyalgia, what is 'cognitive restructuring' primarily aimed at?",
            "options": ["Changing the physical structure of the brain.", "Identifying and modifying negative or unhelpful thought patterns.", "Improving physical strength and endurance.", "Suppressing emotional responses to pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring targets maladaptive thoughts and beliefs that contribute to pain perception and emotional distress, aiming to replace them with more adaptive and helpful cognitions."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary interventions has shown the MOST promising results in reducing inflammation and pain in individuals with fibromyalgia, according to recent research?",
            "options": ["A high-sugar, low-fat diet.", "A gluten-free diet, regardless of gluten sensitivity.", "An elimination diet followed by systematic reintroduction of foods to identify triggers.", "A diet consisting exclusively of processed foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elimination diets, followed by careful reintroduction, help identify specific food sensitivities that contribute to inflammation and pain in some individuals with fibromyalgia. A 2022 study published in 'Nutrients' supports this approach."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia reports persistent insomnia. Beyond basic sleep hygiene, what advanced sleep disorder management technique might be MOST appropriate as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high dose of melatonin immediately.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).", "Recommending over-the-counter antihistamines nightly.", "Suggesting they only sleep when they feel extremely tired."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT-I is a first-line treatment for insomnia, addressing the cognitive and behavioral factors that perpetuate sleep problems. It is generally preferred over medication as an initial intervention."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "Which type of mindfulness meditation has been specifically shown to reduce pain catastrophizing and improve acceptance of chronic pain in individuals with fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Transcendental Meditation.", "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).", "Guided Imagery.", "Loving-Kindness Meditation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MBSR has been extensively studied and shown to be effective in reducing pain catastrophizing and improving acceptance of chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia. A meta-analysis by Reiner et al. (2013) supports this."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "A client is struggling to communicate their needs to their family regarding their fibromyalgia symptoms. What is the MOST effective advanced communication technique to teach them?",
            "options": ["Aggressively demanding that their family understand their condition.", "Using 'I' statements to express their feelings and needs without blaming others.", "Avoiding discussing their symptoms to prevent burdening their family.", "Minimizing their pain levels to appear stronger."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using 'I' statements promotes clear and assertive communication, allowing the client to express their needs and feelings without creating defensiveness in others. This is a key skill in advocating for oneself."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 45-year-old client with fibromyalgia, has tried basic pacing strategies with limited success. She reports significant post-exertional malaise even after simple activities. What advanced pacing technique would be MOST appropriate to implement NEXT?",
            "options": ["Encouraging her to gradually increase her activity levels by 20% each week.", "Implementing a strict 'rest-only' approach for two weeks.", "Utilizing heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback to guide activity levels and prevent overexertion.", "Suggesting she ignore the pain and push through it."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV biofeedback can provide real-time feedback on physiological stress levels, allowing Sarah to adjust her activity levels to stay within her energy envelope and minimize post-exertional malaise."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A holistic treatment plan must be individualized, considering the client's unique needs, preferences, and symptom profile. A 'one-size-fits-all' approach is unlikely to be effective."
