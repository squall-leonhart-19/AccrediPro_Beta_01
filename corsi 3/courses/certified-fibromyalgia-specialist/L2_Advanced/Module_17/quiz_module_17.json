            "question": "A 72-year-old female presents with new-onset fibromyalgia symptoms. Considering the unique challenges of diagnosing fibromyalgia in the elderly, which of the following is the MOST crucial initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant.", "Ordering a comprehensive panel of blood tests to rule out other conditions.", "Recommending a vigorous exercise program.", "Assuming the diagnosis based on ACR criteria alone."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In elderly patients, new-onset fibromyalgia symptoms can often mimic or be masked by other age-related conditions. A comprehensive blood test panel is crucial to rule out conditions like polymyalgia rheumatica, hypothyroidism, and vitamin deficiencies before attributing symptoms solely to fibromyalgia."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A 16-year-old adolescent is diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Her mother reports a history of substance use disorder. What is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a strong opioid pain medication.", "Ignoring the mother's history as irrelevant.", "Screening the adolescent for substance use and assessing the family's support system.", "Referring the adolescent for cognitive behavioral therapy without addressing potential substance use issues."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adolescents with fibromyalgia are at increased risk for substance use, especially with a family history. Screening for substance use and assessing the family's support system are crucial first steps to ensure appropriate and holistic care."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A patient with fibromyalgia also has a history of rheumatoid arthritis. Which of the following pharmacological approaches would be MOST appropriate to manage both conditions concurrently?",
            "options": ["Prescribing high-dose opioids for pain management.", "Continuing the patient's current DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis and adding a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant for fibromyalgia.", "Discontinuing all medications and recommending only physical therapy.", "Prescribing NSAIDs at the maximum dose for both conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Continuing DMARDs for rheumatoid arthritis is essential to control the underlying autoimmune process. Adding a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant can help manage fibromyalgia symptoms without interfering with the RA treatment. Opioids are generally avoided due to the risk of dependence and limited long-term efficacy."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A patient with fibromyalgia reports experiencing frequent migraines and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This presentation is an example of:",
            "options": ["A rare coincidence.", "Central sensitization and overlapping conditions.", "Malingering.", "A purely psychological problem."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fibromyalgia often co-occurs with other conditions like migraines and IBS due to the shared underlying mechanism of central sensitization, where the central nervous system amplifies pain signals."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST significant ethical consideration when treating a patient with fibromyalgia who also has a history of trauma?",
            "options": ["Obtaining informed consent and ensuring patient autonomy.", "Focusing solely on pain management without addressing the trauma history.", "Ignoring the trauma history to avoid triggering the patient.", "Prescribing medications without discussing potential side effects."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Informed consent and patient autonomy are paramount, especially in patients with trauma history. Treatment plans should be collaborative, and patients should be fully informed about all aspects of their care, including potential risks and benefits."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A patient with fibromyalgia also has a diagnosis of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate to address both conditions?",
            "options": ["Recommending complete bed rest.", "Suggesting increased salt and fluid intake, along with graduated exercise.", "Prescribing a high dose of beta-blockers.", "Ignoring the POTS diagnosis and focusing solely on fibromyalgia pain management."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "POTS is often managed with increased salt and fluid intake to increase blood volume, along with graduated exercise to improve cardiovascular conditioning. Beta-blockers may be used in some cases, but are not the first-line treatment and can exacerbate fibromyalgia symptoms in some individuals."

        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A study found that individuals with fibromyalgia and a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) reported significantly higher pain scores (<span class=\"stat-highlight\">β = 0.42, p < 0.001</span>). This finding suggests:",
            "options": ["ACEs have no impact on fibromyalgia pain.", "There is a strong positive correlation between ACEs and pain intensity in fibromyalgia patients.", "The relationship is purely coincidental.", "The study is flawed and unreliable."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The statistical significance (p < 0.001) and positive beta coefficient (β = 0.42) indicate a strong, statistically significant positive correlation between adverse childhood experiences and pain intensity in individuals with fibromyalgia. This means that individuals with a history of ACEs tend to report higher pain scores."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A 55-year-old male with fibromyalgia reports new-onset chest pain. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. What is the MOST important next step?",
            "options": ["Reassure him that it is likely just musculoskeletal pain from fibromyalgia.", "Order an immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzyme testing.", "Increase his fibromyalgia medication dosage.", "Recommend a massage."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "New-onset chest pain in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors requires immediate evaluation for potential cardiac ischemia. An ECG and cardiac enzyme testing are crucial to rule out acute coronary syndrome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Which of the following non-pharmacological interventions is MOST likely to be beneficial for a child with fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Prolonged bed rest.", "High-intensity resistance training.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy.", "Strict dietary restrictions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CBT helps children manage pain and develop coping strategies, while graded exercise therapy gradually increases physical activity levels to improve function and reduce pain. Prolonged bed rest can worsen symptoms, and high-intensity exercise may be too strenuous. Strict dietary restrictions are generally not indicated unless there are specific food sensitivities or allergies."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A patient with fibromyalgia is also being treated for opioid use disorder with buprenorphine. Which of the following pain management strategies would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Prescribing high-dose NSAIDs.", "Recommending non-pharmacological approaches such as physical therapy, acupuncture, and mindfulness-based stress reduction.", "Adding a benzodiazepine for anxiety and muscle relaxation.", "Continuing to prescribe short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the patient's history of opioid use disorder, non-pharmacological approaches are the safest and most appropriate first-line treatment for fibromyalgia pain. NSAIDs should be used with caution due to potential side effects. Benzodiazepines can increase the risk of respiratory depression and addiction. Continuing to prescribe opioids would be contraindicated."
