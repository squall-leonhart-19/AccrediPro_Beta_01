            "question": "Which of the following is a primary domain assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R)?",
            "options": ["Cognitive function", "Overall impact", "Cardiovascular health", "Respiratory function"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The FIQ-R primarily assesses cognitive function, along with physical function and symptom severity, to provide an overall impact score related to fibromyalgia."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "The Revised Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (rFAS) classifies patients into categories based on symptom severity. Which of the following best describes the purpose of this classification?",
            "options": ["To determine eligibility for disability benefits", "To guide treatment decisions and monitor progress", "To predict the likelihood of remission", "To assess the patient's personality traits"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rFAS classification is primarily designed to guide treatment decisions by categorizing patients based on their symptom severity and to monitor their progress over time."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A patient scores high on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention based on this finding?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high dose of opioid medication", "Referring the patient for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)", "Recommending complete bed rest", "Suggesting immediate surgery"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high score on the PCS suggests that the patient is experiencing significant catastrophizing thoughts related to their pain. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention to address these thoughts and improve coping strategies."

            "question": "Which statement best describes the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)?",
            "options": ["It measures the intensity of pain experienced by the patient.", "It assesses the patient's fear of movement and re-injury.", "It evaluates the patient's sleep quality.", "It quantifies the patient's level of depression."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) is specifically designed to assess the patient's fear of movement and re-injury, which can significantly impact their participation in physical activities and rehabilitation."

            "options": ["Minimal fatigue", "Mild fatigue", "Moderate fatigue", "Severe fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A score of 65 on the FSS indicates severe fatigue, as the scale ranges from 9 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue severity. A score above 50 is generally considered indicative of clinically significant fatigue."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) assesses fatigue across several dimensions. Which of the following is NOT a dimension assessed by the MFI?",
            "options": ["General fatigue", "Physical fatigue", "Mental fatigue", "Emotional fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) assesses fatigue across five dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation. It does not directly assess emotional fatigue."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'sleep latency' component of the PSQI measures the time in minutes it takes for an individual to fall asleep after going to bed. This is an important indicator of sleep quality and potential sleep disorders."

            "options": ["GAD-7", "PHQ-9", "Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI)", "6-Minute Walk Test"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Sleep Hygiene Index (SHI) is designed to assess behaviors and habits related to sleep hygiene, such as bedtime routines, napping patterns, and caffeine consumption, making it the most appropriate tool for this scenario."

            "options": ["Recommending a sedentary lifestyle to prevent falls", "Initiating a balance and gait training program", "Prescribing anti-anxiety medication", "Suggesting immediate joint replacement surgery"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A score of 45% on the ABC scale indicates low balance confidence and a higher risk of falls. Initiating a balance and gait training program would be the most appropriate intervention to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls."
