            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the case study of fibromyalgia with co-occurring PTSD, which of the following interventions is MOST likely to address both conditions effectively?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high-dose opioid analgesic.", "Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).", "Recommending complete bed rest to reduce pain.", "Suggesting the client avoid discussing traumatic events."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that directly addresses trauma-related thoughts and beliefs, and can also reduce pain catastrophizing often associated with fibromyalgia. Opioids are generally not recommended, and avoidance strategies are counterproductive."

        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A geriatric patient with fibromyalgia presents with new-onset cognitive difficulties. Which of the following is the MOST important initial step?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting the patient on an anticholinesterase inhibitor.", "Ordering a comprehensive cognitive assessment to rule out dementia.", "Prescribing a high dose of NSAIDs to reduce pain and inflammation.", "Assuming the cognitive difficulties are solely due to fibromyalgia."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "New-onset cognitive difficulties in a geriatric patient require a thorough evaluation to rule out underlying conditions such as dementia or medication side effects. A comprehensive cognitive assessment is crucial before initiating treatment."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A 16-year-old with fibromyalgia is struggling in school due to chronic pain and fatigue. Which of the following school accommodations is LEAST likely to be beneficial?",
            "options": ["Extended time on tests and assignments.", "A 504 plan that includes rest breaks during the day.", "Requiring the student to attend every extracurricular activity to promote social interaction.", "Allowing the student to have a designated quiet space for managing pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Forcing a student with fibromyalgia to participate in every extracurricular activity can exacerbate their symptoms and is unlikely to be beneficial. Accommodations should focus on reducing stress and providing support for managing pain and fatigue."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of individuals with fibromyalgia also meet the criteria for at least one other comorbid condition?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%.", "Approximately 30%.", "Approximately 50%.", "Approximately 80%."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 80% of individuals with fibromyalgia have at least one other comorbid condition, highlighting the importance of assessing for and addressing comorbidities in treatment planning."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) with a fibromyalgia patient, which of the following is the PRIMARY goal?",
            "options": ["To eliminate chronic pain completely.", "To change the patient's pain perception.", "To increase psychological flexibility and engagement in valued activities despite pain.", "To identify and challenge negative thoughts about pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility, which allows patients to accept pain as a part of their experience and commit to engaging in valued activities despite the presence of pain. It's not about eliminating pain, but changing the relationship with it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "During a Motivational Interviewing (MI) session with a fibromyalgia patient, you hear them say, 'I know I should exercise more, but it just hurts too much.' Which MI principle would guide your NEXT response?",
            "options": ["Confrontation.", "Developing discrepancy.", "Supporting self-efficacy.", "Arguing for change."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supporting self-efficacy is crucial in MI. Acknowledging the patient's difficulty while gently exploring potential solutions or smaller, more manageable steps can help build confidence and motivation for change."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a potential ethical violation in the treatment of fibromyalgia?",
            "options": ["Referring a patient to a pain management specialist.", "Prescribing a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.", "Guaranteeing a complete cure for fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Obtaining informed consent from the patient before initiating treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guaranteeing a complete cure for fibromyalgia is an ethical violation because it is misleading and sets unrealistic expectations. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition, and while symptoms can be managed, a complete cure is not currently possible."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "A new research study suggests a potential link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and fibromyalgia symptoms. As a practitioner, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending a specific probiotic supplement to all fibromyalgia patients.", "Waiting for more research to confirm the findings before making any changes to treatment protocols.", "Educating yourself about the potential role of the gut microbiome in fibromyalgia and considering further investigation in appropriate patients.", "Dismissing the research as preliminary and irrelevant to clinical practice."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Staying informed about emerging research and considering its potential implications for clinical practice is crucial. However, it's important to avoid making premature recommendations based on preliminary findings and to individualize treatment based on patient needs and preferences."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "In the case study involving a patient with fibromyalgia and an autoimmune comorbidity (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), which treatment approach is MOST likely to be effective?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on treating the fibromyalgia symptoms.", "Focusing solely on treating the autoimmune condition.", "An integrated approach that addresses both the fibromyalgia and the autoimmune condition.", "Ignoring the autoimmune condition and prescribing high-dose opioids for pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An integrated approach is essential when fibromyalgia co-occurs with an autoimmune condition. Addressing both conditions concurrently can lead to better overall outcomes and improved quality of life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "What is a key challenge in diagnosing fibromyalgia in pediatric patients compared to adults?",
            "options": ["Pediatric patients always present with more severe pain symptoms.", "The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are different in children.", "Comorbid conditions are less common in pediatric fibromyalgia.", "Children may have difficulty articulating their pain and fatigue experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A significant challenge in diagnosing fibromyalgia in children is their potential difficulty in accurately describing their pain, fatigue, and other subjective experiences. This can make it harder to meet the diagnostic criteria and differentiate fibromyalgia from other conditions."
