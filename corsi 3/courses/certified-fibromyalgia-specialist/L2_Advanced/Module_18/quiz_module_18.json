            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. She reports a history of childhood trauma. According to the principles of personalized treatment plans, what is the MOST important initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant", "Assessing for comorbid conditions and psychological factors", "Recommending a strict exercise regimen", "Initiating a sleep hygiene protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personalized treatment plans emphasize a thorough assessment of individual needs, including comorbid conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety) and psychological factors (e.g., trauma), before initiating specific interventions. This ensures a tailored approach."

            "options": ["Financial Security", "Social Connections", "Physical Appearance", "Career Advancement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all options can contribute to life satisfaction, research consistently highlights the importance of strong social connections and supportive relationships for individuals with chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia. Addressing isolation and promoting social engagement are crucial for fostering overall well-being."

            "options": ["Acupuncture", "Chiropractic Manipulation", "Massage Therapy", "Tai Chi"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Multiple meta-analyses, including a 2023 review in *Arthritis Care & Research*, have shown that Tai Chi is associated with significant reductions in pain and improvements in physical function compared to usual care or other interventions in individuals with fibromyalgia. Acupuncture, Chiropractic Manipulation, and Massage Therapy may also offer benefits, but the evidence base for Tai Chi is currently stronger."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "A client reports a sudden increase in fibromyalgia symptoms after a stressful life event. What proactive strategy is MOST appropriate for managing this flare-up?",
            "options": ["Increasing opioid medication dosage", "Implementing a structured pacing strategy", "Discontinuing all physical activity", "Ignoring the symptoms and hoping they subside"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Structured pacing involves carefully balancing activity and rest to avoid overexertion and symptom exacerbation. It is a key proactive strategy for managing flare-ups and preventing further deconditioning."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personalized medicine approaches, including genetic and biomarker profiling, are emerging as promising avenues for tailoring fibromyalgia treatments to individual patient characteristics and predicting treatment response. This contrasts with a one-size-fits-all approach."
