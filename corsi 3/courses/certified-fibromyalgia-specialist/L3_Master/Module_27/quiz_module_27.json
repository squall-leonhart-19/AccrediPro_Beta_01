            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In geriatric patients with fibromyalgia, assessing for polypharmacy and potential drug interactions is paramount due to the increased risk of adverse events and falls. This should precede other interventions such as exercise or bone density scans."

            "options": ["Duloxetine", "Amitriptyline", "Acetaminophen", "Pregabalin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acetaminophen is generally considered the safest pharmacological option for pain relief during pregnancy, while other medications like duloxetine, amitriptyline, and pregabalin carry higher risks and should be avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh risks."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques have demonstrated efficacy in managing both fibromyalgia symptoms and mental health comorbidities like depression and anxiety, offering a holistic approach to treatment."

            "question": "According to research on gut health and fibromyalgia, which of the following dietary interventions is MOST likely to improve symptoms in patients with confirmed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?",
            "options": ["A high-fiber diet", "A low-FODMAP diet", "A ketogenic diet", "A diet rich in processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet is often recommended for patients with fibromyalgia and confirmed SIBO, as it reduces the fermentation of carbohydrates in the gut, potentially alleviating symptoms like bloating and abdominal pain."
