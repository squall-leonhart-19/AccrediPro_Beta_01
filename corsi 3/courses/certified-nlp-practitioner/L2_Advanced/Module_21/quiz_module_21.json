            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "In the A.N.C.H.O.R. model, which phase focuses on gathering detailed information about the client's presenting problem and desired outcome?",
            "options": ["Neutralize", "Assess", "Create", "Harness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Assess' phase is dedicated to understanding the client's current state, desired state, and the gap between them. This comprehensive evaluation forms the foundation of the treatment plan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "Which of the following NLP techniques is MOST directly associated with the 'Neutralize' phase of the A.N.C.H.O.R. model, aiming to reduce the intensity of negative emotions or limiting beliefs?",
            "options": ["Future Pacing", "Anchoring", "Reframing", "Submodality Shifting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reframing techniques are central to the 'Neutralize' phase. They help clients shift their perspective on a problem, making it less impactful. Anchoring can also be used, but primarily to establish resourceful states *after* reframing."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["To diagnose underlying psychological disorders.", "To improve rapport and tailor communication for maximum impact.", "To identify potential allergies or sensitivities.", "To assess cognitive function and memory."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding a client's preferred representational system enhances rapport and allows the practitioner to tailor their language and interventions for greater effectiveness. For example, a visual person may respond better to imagery-based techniques."

            "options": ["To identify and address any remaining incongruencies or resistance.", "To establish a strong anchor for future success.", "To revisit and re-evaluate the initial assessment.", "To congratulate the client on their progress."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Optimize' phase is about fine-tuning the treatment plan by identifying and resolving any lingering doubts, conflicts, or resistance that might hinder the client's progress. This ensures a smoother transition to the 'Reinforce' phase."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "This question elicits detailed information about Sarah's subjective experience, including her thoughts, feelings, and sensations. This is crucial for understanding the structure of her anxiety and designing effective interventions."

What does this statistic suggest?",
            "options": ["Future pacing is only effective for certain personality types.", "Future pacing is a crucial component for solidifying lasting change.", "Future pacing is a placebo effect.", "Future pacing is unnecessary for clients who have already achieved significant progress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The statistic suggests that future pacing significantly contributes to the maintenance of positive changes over time. Actively visualizing future success reinforces the new patterns and increases the likelihood of long-term adherence."
