        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client presents with both anxiety and a history of childhood trauma. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin trauma reprocessing using visualization techniques.", "Focus solely on the anxiety symptoms, ignoring the trauma history.", "Establish a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship before addressing the trauma.", "Administer a standardized psychological test to assess the severity of both conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and trust is paramount, especially with trauma survivors. Rushing into trauma work without this foundation can be re-traumatizing. (See module L2: Addressing Trauma-Informed NLP)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "According to research cited in the course, what percentage of individuals with substance use disorders also have a co-occurring mental health disorder?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that about 50% of individuals with substance use disorders also have a co-occurring mental health disorder, highlighting the importance of integrated treatment approaches. (See module L1: Navigating Clients with Co-morbid Conditions)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "In the context of NLP, what does 'parts integration' primarily aim to achieve?",
            "options": ["To eliminate conflicting inner voices completely.", "To suppress unwanted thoughts and feelings.", "To create harmony and alignment between different aspects of the self.", "To identify and label each distinct 'part' of the personality."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parts integration aims to bring conflicting inner aspects into a state of collaboration and harmony, rather than suppression or elimination. (See module L5: Resolving Inner Conflicts and Parts Integration)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client with Borderline Personality Disorder is exhibiting intense emotional reactivity during a session. Which NLP technique would be LEAST advisable at this stage?",
            "options": ["Anchoring a calming state.", "Using perceptual positions to understand different perspectives.", "Employing the fast phobia cure.", "Establishing clear boundaries and expectations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Fast Phobia Cure, which involves intense visualization and dissociation, could be destabilizing for someone with BPD experiencing emotional dysregulation. Anchoring, perceptual positions, and boundary setting are generally more appropriate. (See module L3: Working with Clients with Personality Disorders)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY ethical consideration when working with clients who have experienced significant grief and loss?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to 'move on' as quickly as possible.", "Avoiding any discussion of the deceased to prevent further distress.", "Respecting the client's individual grieving process and timeline.", "Imposing your own beliefs about death and the afterlife on the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Respecting the client's individual grieving process is crucial. There is no 'right' way to grieve, and pressuring someone to 'move on' can be harmful. (See module L6: Working with Grief and Loss)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client is struggling with a deeply ingrained belief that 'I am unlovable.' Which advanced reframing technique would be MOST effective in challenging this belief?",
            "options": ["Reframing the context of the belief.", "Simply stating a positive affirmation.", "Using the Swish Pattern to replace the belief.", "Ignoring the belief and focusing on positive experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reframing the context of the belief allows the client to examine the origins and circumstances surrounding the belief, often revealing that it is not universally true or applicable. (See module L7: Advanced Reframing Techniques for Complex Beliefs)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of 'resource anchoring' in NLP?",
            "options": ["To create a physical anchor to a past traumatic event.", "To associate a specific feeling or state with a trigger.", "To eliminate negative emotions permanently.", "To predict future behavior accurately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resource anchoring involves associating a desired feeling or state (e.g., confidence, calm) with a specific trigger (e.g., a touch, a word) that the client can then use to access that state in the future. (General NLP concept, applicable across modules)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client reports engaging in compulsive hand-washing due to obsessive thoughts about contamination. Besides addressing the compulsive behavior, what other area should be explored using NLP?",
            "options": ["The client's childhood relationship with their parents.", "The underlying anxiety and triggers associated with the obsessive thoughts.", "The client's dietary habits and exercise routine.", "The client's career aspirations and goals."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying anxiety and triggers is crucial for long-term success in managing compulsive behaviors. NLP techniques can help identify and modify these triggers. (See module L4: NLP for Addictions and Compulsive Behaviors)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_9",

            "options": ["The Fast Phobia Cure", "The Swish Pattern", "Parts Integration", "Timeline Therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Swish Pattern was highlighted as a particularly effective tool for Sarah in managing cravings and changing unwanted behaviors related to her addiction. (See module L4: NLP for Addictions and Compulsive Behaviors, specific case study details)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "What is the MOST important aspect of maintaining ethical boundaries when working with complex client scenarios?",
            "options": ["Adhering strictly to pre-determined session lengths.", "Avoiding any personal disclosure whatsoever.", "Prioritizing the client's well-being and remaining within your scope of practice.", "Guaranteeing specific outcomes for the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's well-being, practicing within your competence, and maintaining appropriate boundaries are fundamental ethical principles. Guaranteeing outcomes is unrealistic and unethical. (See module L8: Ethical Considerations and Scope of Practice in Complex Cases)"
