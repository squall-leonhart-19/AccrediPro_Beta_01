        {
            "id": "q24_1",
            "question": "Which advanced elicitation technique focuses on uncovering the presuppositions embedded within a client's language?",
            "options": ["Chunking", "Meta-Model III", "Sensory Acuity Calibration", "Timeline Elicitation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-Model III delves into the underlying assumptions within a client's statements, revealing deeper structures of thought. Chunking involves moving between levels of specificity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A client states, 'I can't present confidently because I always mess up.' Which reframing technique would be MOST effective initially?",
            "options": ["Context Reframe", "Meaning Reframe", "Six-Step Reframe", "Ecology Check"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A context reframe changes the context in which the behavior occurs, making it more acceptable. For example, 'When have you been successful at presenting?'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Stacking anchors involves:",
            "options": ["Firing multiple anchors simultaneously to intensify a state.", "Sequentially firing anchors to build a desired state.", "Collapsing negative anchors into positive ones.", "Using only visual anchors for maximum impact."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stacking anchors involves triggering multiple anchors in a specific sequence to gradually build and intensify the desired emotional state. As discussed, this can be helpful when a single anchor is not sufficient to elicit the full state."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Which language pattern is used to create an illusion of choice, while subtly directing the client towards a specific outcome?",
            "options": ["Embedded Commands", "Presuppositions", "Double Binds", "Nominalizations"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Double binds offer two choices, both of which lead to the desired outcome, creating an illusion of freedom while still directing the client. For example, 'Will you relax now, or in a few minutes?'"
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A client describes feeling 'heavy' when thinking about public speaking. To shift this submodality, you might ask them to:",
            "options": ["Increase the brightness of the image.", "Make the sound louder.", "Change the location of the feeling.", "All of the above."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Submodalities are the qualities of our internal representations. Adjusting any of these (brightness, sound, location) can alter the feeling associated with the thought, providing more control."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "During values elicitation, a client consistently uses the word 'success' but struggles to define it. What's the BEST follow-up question?",
            "options": ["'What does success mean to you?'", "'Why is success important to you?'", "'How do you know when you've achieved success?'", "'Who do you know that embodies success?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Asking 'How do you know when you've achieved success?' helps the client to define success in concrete, measurable terms, making the value more actionable and understandable."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "Which strategy is MOST effective when encountering resistance in a client?",
            "options": ["Directly challenging their beliefs.", "Pacing and leading their current state.", "Immediately implementing advanced techniques.", "Ignoring the resistance and proceeding with the intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pacing and leading involves acknowledging and validating the client's current state before gently guiding them towards a more resourceful one. Directly challenging beliefs can increase resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "Future pacing is primarily used to:",
            "options": ["Reframe past experiences.", "Predict future events accurately.", "Install new behaviors and ensure their long-term integration.", "Analyze current problems in detail."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Future pacing involves mentally rehearsing desired behaviors and outcomes in the future to ensure they become ingrained and automatic. This helps integrate new skills into the client's life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A client is sabotaging their weight loss goals by late-night snacking. Which NLP technique would be MOST helpful in addressing this self-sabotage?",
            "options": ["Visual/Kinesthetic Dissociation", "Parts Integration", "Anchoring a 'Stopping' Cue", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "All options are appropriate. Visual/Kinesthetic Dissociation can reduce the appeal of the food, Parts Integration can resolve conflicting desires, and Anchoring a 'Stopping' Cue can interrupt the snacking behavior."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "During advanced elicitation, a client states: 'People are untrustworthy'. Which Meta Model III question would challenge the presupposition of the implied universal quantifier?",
            "options": ["'What specifically makes them untrustworthy?'", "'All people? Really?'", "'How do you know that?'", "'Have you always felt this way?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'All people? Really?' directly challenges the universal quantifier 'people', forcing the client to reconsider the generalization and potentially uncover exceptions to the rule."
