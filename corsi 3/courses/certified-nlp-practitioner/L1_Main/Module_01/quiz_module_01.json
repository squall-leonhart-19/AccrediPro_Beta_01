            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Establishing rapport is fundamental to building trust and facilitating open communication, which is essential for effective assessment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory acuity focuses on improving your ability to notice and interpret subtle non-verbal communication, such as micro-expressions and shifts in physiology."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calibration is the ability to observe and recognize consistent patterns in a person's behavior that correlate with their internal states."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client states, 'I want to be more successful,' but doesn't specify what success means to them. According to the principles of well-formed outcomes, what is the MOST important next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately start brainstorming strategies for achieving success.", "Explore the client's past successes to identify patterns.", "Help the client define specifically what 'success' means to them.", "Refer the client to a career counselor for guidance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A well-formed outcome must be clearly defined and specific. Vague goals like 'success' need to be clarified to be actionable."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'hierarchy of criteria' involves asking a series of 'why' questions to uncover the underlying values that drive a person's choices and behaviors. For instance, asking 'Why is that important to you?' repeatedly."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Changes in physiology, such as avoiding eye contact and changes in vocal tone, often signal discomfort or resistance. This requires further exploration with the client."
