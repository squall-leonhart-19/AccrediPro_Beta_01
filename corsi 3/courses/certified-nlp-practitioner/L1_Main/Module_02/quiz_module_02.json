            "options": ["Amplifying positive emotions.", "Eliminating all emotions.", "Diminishing the intensity of negative emotions associated with a specific trigger.", "Creating new, intense emotional responses."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neutralization aims to reduce the intensity of unwanted negative emotions without necessarily eliminating them entirely."

            "options": ["Future Pacing.", "Anchoring.", "Logical Levels Alignment.", "Sensory Acuity Enhancement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchoring can be used to disrupt the anxiety response by associating a new, more empowering state with the trigger situation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation techniques work by creating a sense of separation between the individual and the distressing memory or experience, thereby reducing its emotional impact."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Submodalities are the finer details of our sensory representations, such as brightness, size, location, and intensity, which influence our emotional responses."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Parts Integration recognizes that seemingly conflicting internal 'parts' each have a positive intention and seeks to integrate them in a way that honors these intentions, leading to greater internal harmony."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
