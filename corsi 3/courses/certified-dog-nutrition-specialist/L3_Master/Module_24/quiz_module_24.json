            "question": "When transitioning a sensitive dog to a B.A.R.F. diet, which strategy is MOST crucial for minimizing digestive upset?",
            "options": ["Rapidly switching to the new diet over 1-2 days.", "Introducing novel protein sources early in the transition.", "Starting with very small portions of easily digestible ingredients.", "Supplementing with high doses of probiotics from the outset."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting with small portions of easily digestible ingredients, like cooked white fish or bone broth, allows the digestive system to adapt gradually, reducing the risk of adverse reactions. A gradual transition is key for sensitive dogs."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A client with a high-drive Border Collie participating in agility trials wants to optimize their dog's performance with B.A.R.F. Which macronutrient adjustment is MOST likely to benefit their athletic performance?",
            "options": ["Decreasing fat intake to prevent weight gain.", "Increasing carbohydrate intake for quick energy.", "Increasing protein intake to support muscle recovery and repair.", "Maintaining a standard B.A.R.F. ratio without adjustments."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Canine athletes benefit from increased protein to support muscle recovery and repair after intense exercise. While fat is important for energy, protein is crucial for muscle maintenance and performance. Studies show that dogs with higher protein intake have better muscle mass."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key ethical consideration when recommending a B.A.R.F. diet for a client's dog?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the client is fully informed about the potential risks and benefits.", "Guaranteeing the diet will cure all of the dog's health issues.", "Promoting the diet as superior to all other feeding methods.", "Discouraging the client from seeking veterinary advice."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice involves providing clients with comprehensive information about the diet, including both potential benefits and risks, so they can make informed decisions. Transparency and honesty are paramount."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to recent research, what is a potential benefit of incorporating specific omega-3 fatty acids into a B.A.R.F. diet for dogs with cancer?",
            "options": ["Increased tumor growth rate.", "Reduced inflammation and improved immune function.", "Decreased appetite and weight loss.", "Increased risk of metastasis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA found in fish oil, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may improve immune function in dogs with cancer. A 2019 study in the *Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine* highlighted the potential of omega-3s to support cancer treatment."

            "question": "When managing a dog with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a B.A.R.F. diet, what is the MOST critical macronutrient adjustment?",
            "options": ["Increasing protein intake to maintain muscle mass.", "Restricting phosphorus intake to slow disease progression.", "Increasing sodium intake to promote water retention.", "Restricting fat intake to reduce kidney workload."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phosphorus restriction is crucial in managing CKD to slow disease progression. High phosphorus levels can exacerbate kidney damage. Protein intake should also be carefully managed, but phosphorus is the priority."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "A client is hesitant to switch to B.A.R.F. due to concerns about bacterial contamination. What is the BEST way to address their concern?",
            "options": ["Dismiss their concerns as unfounded.", "Provide evidence-based information on safe handling and preparation practices.", "Guarantee that there is absolutely no risk of contamination.", "Suggest they ignore all food safety guidelines."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing clients with evidence-based information on safe handling and preparation practices, such as proper hygiene and storage, is the best way to address concerns about bacterial contamination. This empowers them to minimize risks."

            "options": ["The increasing popularity of highly processed kibble diets.", "The decline in research on the gut microbiome's role in health.", "The growing interest in personalized nutrition based on genetic testing.", "The decreasing availability of high-quality raw food ingredients."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personalized nutrition based on genetic testing is an emerging trend that allows for tailoring diets to individual dogs' specific needs and predispositions. This is becoming increasingly accessible and relevant."
