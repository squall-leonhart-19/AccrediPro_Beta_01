            "question": "A dog presents with acute pancreatitis. Which of the following is the MOST crucial initial nutritional intervention?",
            "options": ["High-fat diet to promote enzyme production", "Complete fasting for 24-48 hours to reduce pancreatic stimulation", "Supplementation with high doses of pancreatic enzymes", "Unlimited access to fresh water and a bland diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fasting helps to reduce pancreatic stimulation and allows the inflammation to subside. Reintroduction of food must be gradual and carefully monitored."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on chronic kidney disease (CKD), what is the primary goal of nutritional management?",
            "options": ["Increase protein intake to maintain muscle mass", "Minimize phosphorus intake to slow disease progression", "Maximize sodium intake to encourage water consumption", "Increase calcium intake to prevent renal secondary hyperparathyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limiting phosphorus intake is crucial in managing CKD as it helps to slow the progression of renal damage and manage secondary hyperparathyroidism."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A canine cancer patient is undergoing chemotherapy and experiencing significant nausea and appetite loss. Which of the following dietary strategies is LEAST likely to improve their nutritional intake?",
            "options": ["Offering small, frequent meals throughout the day", "Warming the food to enhance aroma and palatability", "Providing a novel protein source to avoid food aversion", "Withholding food until the nausea subsides completely"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Withholding food can exacerbate the problem and lead to further nutritional decline. It's important to find ways to encourage intake, even in small amounts."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A dog with suspected food allergies is exhibiting chronic pruritus, diarrhea, and otitis externa. What is the gold standard for diagnosing food allergies?",
            "options": ["Serum allergy testing", "Intradermal skin testing", "Fecal ELISA testing", "Dietary elimination trial followed by a food challenge"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Dietary elimination trials, followed by a controlled food challenge, are the most reliable method for diagnosing food allergies in dogs."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "Which of the following nutritional components is MOST important to consider when managing a dog with idiopathic epilepsy?",
            "options": ["High levels of taurine to support neurotransmitter function", "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to provide an alternative energy source for the brain", "High levels of omega-6 fatty acids to reduce inflammation", "High levels of carbohydrates to fuel brain activity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MCTs have shown promise in reducing seizure frequency in some dogs with epilepsy, potentially by providing an alternative energy source for brain cells."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "An 11-year-old Labrador Retriever is diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST appropriate to support cognitive function?",
            "options": ["Increased protein intake to prevent muscle wasting", "Supplementation with antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and B vitamins", "A diet high in simple carbohydrates for readily available energy", "Restriction of dietary fat to prevent weight gain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and B vitamins have been shown to support cognitive function in senior dogs and may help manage the symptoms of CDS."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A previously healthy dog has become severely underweight despite consuming a seemingly adequate amount of food. What is the FIRST step in addressing this weight gain resistance?",
            "options": ["Immediately increasing the caloric density of the diet", "Performing a thorough veterinary examination to rule out underlying medical conditions", "Supplementing with high doses of anabolic steroids", "Switching to a raw food diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Underweight can be secondary to underlying medical conditions such as parasites, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or malabsorption. Ruling these out is paramount before adjusting diet."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "You are consulting with a client whose dog has a terminal illness. The client expresses a desire to try a highly restrictive and potentially dangerous diet based on anecdotal evidence. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Agree to implement the diet to maintain client compliance", "Politely decline to provide nutritional support and refer them to another nutritionist", "Educate the client on the potential risks and benefits of the diet, while respecting their autonomy", "Implement the diet but closely monitor the dog for adverse effects without informing the client"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It's essential to provide evidence-based information and support the client's informed decisions, even if they differ from your recommendations. Respecting autonomy while ensuring the dog's welfare is paramount."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A dog with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is losing significant amounts of albumin in its feces. Which of the following dietary strategies is MOST likely to improve their condition?",
            "options": ["A high-fiber diet to bind excess protein in the intestines", "A highly digestible, low-fat diet with moderate protein levels", "A diet high in saturated fats to promote nutrient absorption", "A raw food diet to provide natural enzymes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Highly digestible diets reduce the workload on the compromised digestive system, and moderate protein levels help minimize further protein loss while still meeting nutritional needs. Low fat helps manage potential steatorrhea."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A geriatric dog is experiencing muscle wasting and decreased appetite. Bloodwork reveals elevated BUN and creatinine, indicating kidney disease. Which dietary approach is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["High protein, low phosphorus", "Moderate protein, low phosphorus", "High protein, high phosphorus", "Low protein, high phosphorus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
