            "question": "During the Initial Client Assessment using the B.A.R.F. Framework™, which of the following is MOST critical to determine before formulating a raw feeding plan?",
            "options": ["Preferred protein sources of the owner.", "The dog's current activity level and life stage.", "The owner's budget for raw food ingredients.", "The dog's favorite treat flavors."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing the dog's current activity level and life stage is paramount as it directly influences the caloric and nutrient requirements that need to be addressed in the raw feeding plan. These factors are more influential than owner preferences or budget at this initial stage."

        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "When calculating macronutrient ratios for a moderately active adult dog, what is the generally recommended protein percentage (on a dry matter basis) in a raw diet according to the lessons?",
            "options": ["15-20%", "25-35%", "40-50%", "55-65%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For moderately active adult dogs, a protein percentage of 40-50% on a dry matter basis is generally recommended to support muscle maintenance and overall health. Lower percentages may be insufficient, while higher percentages might strain the kidneys."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "A client is transitioning their dog to a raw diet. They report mild diarrhea after the first day. What is the MOST appropriate initial action to advise?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch back to the previous diet.", "Reduce the amount of raw food offered and increase the frequency of meals.", "Administer an anti-diarrheal medication.", "Add more bone content to the raw meal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mild diarrhea during the initial transition can be a normal response to the change in diet. Reducing the amount of raw food and increasing meal frequency can help ease digestion and allow the gut microbiome to adjust gradually."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When formulating a raw feeding recipe, what is the primary purpose of including organ meat?",
            "options": ["To increase the overall protein content.", "To provide essential vitamins and minerals.", "To improve the palatability of the diet.", "To add fiber to the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Organ meats are nutrient-dense and provide essential vitamins and minerals that are not adequately supplied by muscle meat alone. They are a crucial component of a balanced raw diet."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "According to the lessons, which of the following supplements is MOST often recommended for dogs on a properly balanced raw diet?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Calcium", "Vitamin E"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While a balanced raw diet provides many essential nutrients, supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids can further support joint health, skin health, and cognitive function. The other options may be necessary in specific cases but are not universally recommended for all dogs on a balanced raw diet."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "During client education, what is the MOST effective way to address a client's concern about the risk of bacterial contamination in raw food?",
            "options": ["Dismiss their concerns as unfounded.", "Provide scientific evidence and practical advice on safe handling and storage practices.", "Recommend they cook the raw food to eliminate bacteria.", "Suggest they switch to a kibble diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing concerns with evidence-based information and practical guidance on safe handling practices is crucial for building trust and ensuring client compliance. Dismissing concerns or suggesting alternatives without addressing the root issue is not an effective approach."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "A client reports that their dog has been consistently leaving bone fragments in their stool while on a raw diet. What adjustment to the plan is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Increase the amount of bone in the diet.", "Decrease the amount of bone in the diet and consider a finely ground bone meal supplement.", "Add more fiber to the diet.", "Switch to a completely boneless raw diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bone fragments in the stool indicate that the dog is not properly digesting the bone. Decreasing the amount of bone and potentially switching to a finely ground bone meal can improve digestibility and prevent digestive upset. As highlighted in the lessons, a 2022 study in the *Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition* showed that finely ground bone is more digestible than larger bone pieces."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "An 8-year-old Labrador Retriever has been on a raw diet for 2 years. The owner reports that the dog has recently become less active and gained weight. What is the MOST likely adjustment needed to the feeding plan?",
            "options": ["Increase the protein content of the diet.", "Decrease the overall caloric intake.", "Add more carbohydrates to the diet.", "Increase the fat content of the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As dogs age, their metabolism often slows down, leading to decreased activity and weight gain. Reducing the overall caloric intake is the most likely adjustment needed to address these changes. As discussed in the module, a case study involving a similar situation showed a 15% reduction in calories helped the dog return to a healthy weight."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "According to the lessons, which of the following is a key indicator that a raw feeding plan needs adjustment?",
            "options": ["The dog consistently finishes their meals quickly.", "The dog occasionally vomits undigested food.", "The dog maintains a healthy weight and energy level.", "The owner finds the diet easy to prepare."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Occasional vomiting of undigested food can indicate digestive issues or intolerances and suggests that the raw feeding plan may need to be adjusted to improve digestibility or address potential sensitivities. Maintaining a healthy weight and energy level are signs of a successful plan, while meal speed and owner convenience are not direct indicators of the diet's suitability for the dog."

        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "A client is hesitant to make any changes to their dog's current feeding plan, even though the dog is showing signs of nutritional deficiencies. What is the MOST effective communication strategy to encourage compliance?",
            "options": ["Insist that they immediately switch to the recommended plan.", "Emphasize the potential long-term health benefits of the changes and involve them in the decision-making process.", "Threaten to discontinue your services if they don't comply.", "Downplay the severity of the nutritional deficiencies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emphasizing the potential long-term health benefits and involving the client in the decision-making process fosters a collaborative relationship and increases the likelihood of compliance. A study published in the *Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine* in 2021 found that client involvement significantly improved adherence to dietary recommendations."
