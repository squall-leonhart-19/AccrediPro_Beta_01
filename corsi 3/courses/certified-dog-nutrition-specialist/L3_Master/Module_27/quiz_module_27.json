            "question": "Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST crucial for managing canine athletes during intense training periods?",
            "options": ["Decreasing protein intake to reduce muscle fatigue.", "Increasing carbohydrate intake to replenish glycogen stores.", "Limiting fat intake to prevent weight gain.", "Eliminating fiber to improve nutrient absorption."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Canine athletes require increased carbohydrate intake to replenish glycogen stores depleted during intense training. This supports energy levels and performance. Protein needs are also elevated, but carbohydrates are the primary fuel source."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 7-year-old neutered Labrador Retriever presents with a Body Condition Score (BCS) of 7/9. Based on the lesson on canine obesity, what is the FIRST dietary recommendation you should make to the owner?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch to a prescription weight-loss diet with high protein and low fat.", "Gradually reduce the current food intake by 10-20% while increasing exercise.", "Start a ketogenic diet to rapidly induce weight loss.", "Recommend intermittent fasting with no calorie restriction."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial recommendation for managing canine obesity should involve a gradual reduction in current food intake (10-20%) coupled with increased exercise. A sudden switch to a different diet or drastic measures can be detrimental. Prescription diets are useful, but initial steps are key."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Which antioxidant is MOST commonly recommended in nutritional strategies for Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD) to combat oxidative stress?",
            "options": ["Vitamin K", "Vitamin B12", "Vitamin E", "Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that helps combat oxidative stress, a key factor in the development and progression of CCD. Studies suggest that diets rich in Vitamin E can improve cognitive function in aging dogs."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "In managing canine diabetes mellitus, what is the primary goal of nutritional intervention?",
            "options": ["To eliminate the need for insulin injections.", "To minimize postprandial hyperglycemia and maintain stable blood glucose levels.", "To induce weight gain in underweight diabetic dogs.", "To increase fat intake to provide a sustained energy source."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of nutritional intervention in canine diabetes mellitus is to minimize postprandial hyperglycemia and maintain stable blood glucose levels. This is achieved through consistent meal timing, controlled carbohydrate content, and high-fiber diets."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on nutritional support for dogs with cancer, which of the following macronutrient modifications is generally recommended to support lean body mass and potentially slow tumor growth?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.", "High-fat, moderate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.", "Low-protein, high-fiber diet.", "High-fiber, low-fat diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet is often recommended for dogs with cancer. This approach aims to provide energy through fat, support lean body mass with protein, and limit glucose availability for tumor cells."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A dog presents with chronic pruritus, diarrhea, and recurrent ear infections. An elimination diet is suspected. Which type of protein source is MOST appropriate for an elimination diet trial?",
            "options": ["Beef", "Chicken", "Novel protein source (e.g., venison, rabbit)", "Soy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For an elimination diet trial, a novel protein source (one the dog has never been exposed to) is crucial to minimize the risk of triggering an allergic reaction. Common protein sources like beef and chicken are frequently implicated in food allergies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key nutritional consideration for senior dogs to address age-related decline?",
            "options": ["Increasing sodium intake to maintain hydration.", "Decreasing protein intake to protect kidney function.", "Maintaining adequate protein intake to prevent muscle loss (sarcopenia).", "Increasing phosphorus intake to support bone health."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining adequate protein intake is crucial for senior dogs to prevent muscle loss (sarcopenia), a common age-related condition. While kidney health is important, restricting protein excessively can exacerbate muscle wasting. Sodium and phosphorus levels should be carefully managed, not increased."

        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "In the B.A.R.F. (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) framework, what percentage of the diet typically consists of raw meaty bones?",
            "options": ["10-15%", "20-30%", "60-80%", "80-90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the B.A.R.F. framework, raw meaty bones typically make up 10-15% of the diet. This provides calcium, phosphorus, and other essential nutrients, as well as promoting dental health."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A canine athlete competing in agility trials requires a pre-competition meal. When should this meal be provided, and what should it primarily consist of?",
            "options": ["Immediately before competition; primarily fat.", "3-4 hours before competition; primarily protein.", "1-2 hours before competition; primarily simple sugars.", "3-4 hours before competition; primarily complex carbohydrates."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A pre-competition meal for a canine athlete should be provided 3-4 hours before the event and should primarily consist of complex carbohydrates. This allows for efficient glycogen replenishment without causing digestive upset during competition."

        {
            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A dog with confirmed food allergies requires a long-term diet. What is the MOST important consideration when selecting a commercial or homemade diet for this dog?",
            "options": ["The diet's palatability to ensure the dog eats it willingly.", "The diet's cost-effectiveness for the owner.", "The diet's protein and carbohydrate sources are completely novel or hydrolyzed.", "The diet's fiber content to promote digestive health."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For a dog with food allergies, the MOST important consideration is that the diet's protein and carbohydrate sources are completely novel (the dog has never been exposed to them) or hydrolyzed (broken down into smaller, non-allergenic components). This minimizes the risk of triggering an allergic reaction."
