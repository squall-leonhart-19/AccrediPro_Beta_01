            "question": "A client reports that their dog has been consistently experiencing soft stools after transitioning to a raw diet. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial action based on the Functional Follow-up (F) principle of the B.A.R.F. Framework™?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the raw diet.", "Reduce the amount of bone content in the diet.", "Increase the amount of organ meat in the diet.", "Add probiotics and prebiotics to the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical consideration a Certified Dog Nutrition Specialist™ should address when recommending a novel protein source for a dog with suspected food sensitivities?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the protein source is readily available and affordable for the client.", "Verifying the sustainability of the protein source and its environmental impact.", "Confirming the protein source has not been previously consumed by the dog to minimize allergic reactions.", "Guaranteeing the protein source is palatable and readily accepted by the dog."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core ethical principle is to minimize potential allergic reactions. Novel proteins are chosen because the dog's immune system is unlikely to have encountered them before, reducing the risk of an allergic response. Ensuring that the animal hasn’t been exposed to the protein minimizes reaction potential."
