            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "When transitioning a dog to a raw food diet using advanced integration techniques, what is the primary benefit of starting with easily digestible proteins like poultry?",
            "options": ["To increase the fiber content of the diet.", "To minimize the risk of digestive upset and allow the gut microbiome to adapt gradually.", "To provide a higher concentration of taurine.", "To introduce a novel protein source early in the transition."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introducing easily digestible proteins first helps minimize digestive issues as the dog's system adjusts to processing raw food, allowing the gut microbiome to adapt more smoothly."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In functional follow-up, what is the significance of monitoring stool consistency when adjusting a dog's raw diet?",
            "options": ["It is irrelevant to dietary adjustments.", "It provides insights into the digestibility and balance of the diet, indicating potential issues with protein, fat, or fiber content.", "It primarily reflects the dog's hydration level.", "It only indicates the presence of parasites."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stool consistency is a key indicator of how well a dog is digesting and utilizing the nutrients in the raw diet. Changes can signal imbalances or sensitivities."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a scientifically supported response to the common objection that raw feeding poses a high risk of bacterial contamination for humans?",
            "options": ["Raw feeding does pose a high risk and should be avoided.", "Proper hygiene practices, such as hand washing and cleaning food preparation surfaces, significantly minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.", "Freezing raw food completely eliminates all bacterial risks.", "Feeding only commercially prepared raw diets eliminates the risk of contamination."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While raw food can carry bacteria, the risk is manageable with appropriate hygiene. Studies show that standard food safety practices are effective in minimizing contamination."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "What specific dietary modification is often recommended when designing a raw diet for senior dogs to address decreased kidney function?",
            "options": ["Increasing protein intake to support muscle mass.", "Reducing phosphorus content to minimize strain on the kidneys.", "Increasing sodium intake to promote hydration.", "Supplementing with high levels of calcium."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing phosphorus is crucial for senior dogs with kidney issues, as it helps to slow the progression of kidney disease. The lesson covers the importance of careful mineral balancing."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "How does raw feeding potentially support a dog's immune system compared to highly processed kibble diets?",
            "options": ["By increasing the risk of parasitic infections, thus stimulating the immune system.", "By providing a more bioavailable source of nutrients, supporting a healthy gut microbiome, and reducing exposure to artificial additives and preservatives.", "By decreasing the production of white blood cells.", "By eliminating the need for vaccinations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Raw diets offer more bioavailable nutrients and promote a healthy gut, which plays a vital role in immune function. Avoiding processed ingredients also reduces potential stressors on the immune system."
