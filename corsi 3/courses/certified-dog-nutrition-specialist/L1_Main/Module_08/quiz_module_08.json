            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The B.A.R.F. Framework™ aims to replicate the natural diet of canids, ensuring optimal health and nutrition in a controlled and balanced manner."

            "question": "What is the recommended macronutrient ratio (Protein:Fat:Carbohydrates) for a highly active adult dog on a B.A.R.F. diet?",
            "options": ["20:60:20", "40:30:30", "50:40:10", "30:20:50"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A highly active dog typically requires a higher protein and fat intake for energy, with limited carbohydrates. A ratio of 50:40:10 aligns with these needs."

            "options": ["100% raw immediately", "25% raw, gradually increasing over 1-2 weeks", "50% raw, maintaining this ratio for 1 week", "75% raw, monitoring for any adverse reactions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A gradual introduction, starting with a small percentage of raw food, helps the dog's digestive system adapt and minimizes the risk of digestive upset."
