            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "What is the primary concern when including bone in a raw diet, and how is it best mitigated?",
            "options": ["Risk of bacterial contamination; thorough cooking.", "Potential for nutrient imbalances; careful analysis and balancing.", "Risk of choking; grinding bones finely.", "Potential for constipation; ensuring adequate hydration and fiber intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all options have some validity, constipation is the most common issue related to bone inclusion. Adequate hydration and fiber intake are crucial to mitigate this."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Which of the following organ meat ratios provides the most complete nutrient profile, considering both macro and micronutrients?",
            "options": ["80% Muscle Meat, 10% Bone, 5% Liver, 5% Other Organs", "70% Muscle Meat, 10% Bone, 10% Liver, 10% Other Organs", "80% Muscle Meat, 10% Bone, 7% Liver, 3% Other Organs", "60% Muscle Meat, 15% Bone, 15% Liver, 10% Other Organs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ratio of 80% muscle meat, 10% bone, 7% liver, and 3% other organs provides a balanced profile, ensuring adequate vitamin A and other essential nutrients without excessive intake from liver."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which phytonutrient-rich vegetable is MOST beneficial for its anti-inflammatory properties in a raw diet?",
            "options": ["Spinach", "Carrots", "Broccoli", "Blueberries"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Blueberries are exceptionally rich in antioxidants and phytonutrients known for their potent anti-inflammatory effects, surpassing spinach, carrots, and broccoli in this specific benefit."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A raw-fed dog presents with dull coat and brittle nails. Which supplement would be MOST appropriate to address these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Vitamin D", "Probiotics"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for skin and coat health. Deficiencies often manifest as dull coat and brittle nails. Supplementation can significantly improve these conditions."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "What is the MOST common misconception about raw feeding that prevents owners from transitioning their dogs?",
            "options": ["Raw diets are too expensive.", "Raw diets are nutritionally incomplete.", "Raw diets are difficult to prepare.", "Raw diets pose a high risk of bacterial contamination and foodborne illness."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The fear of bacterial contamination (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli) is the most prevalent concern, even though proper handling and sourcing can mitigate this risk effectively."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "When transitioning a dog to a raw diet, what is the recommended initial percentage of raw food to introduce, mixed with their current diet?",
            "options": ["10%", "25%", "50%", "75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with approximately 25% raw food mixed with the current diet allows the dog's digestive system to adapt gradually, minimizing the risk of digestive upset. Increasing slowly over a week or two is ideal."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary concern when formulating a raw diet for a dog with chronic kidney disease?",
            "options": ["High phosphorus content", "High protein content", "High fat content", "Low fiber content"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "High phosphorus intake can exacerbate kidney disease. Raw diets for dogs with CKD should be carefully formulated to limit phosphorus while maintaining adequate nutrition."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "According to the B.A.R.F. Framework™, how frequently should a raw-fed dog's weight and body condition score be monitored?",
            "options": ["Annually", "Every 6 months", "Monthly", "Weekly"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Monthly monitoring of weight and body condition score is recommended to ensure the diet is appropriately meeting the dog's caloric and nutrient needs, allowing for timely adjustments."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Client 'Buddy,' a 7-year-old Labrador, has been on a raw diet for 6 months. He's now experiencing loose stools. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
            "options": ["Insufficient bone content in the diet.", "Excessive organ meat in the diet.", "Introduction of a new protein source.", "Inadequate hydration."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Excessive organ meat, particularly liver, can lead to loose stools due to its high nutrient density and potential for digestive upset if not properly balanced with other components of the diet. A new protein source could also cause this, but given the 6-month history, it's less likely than excessive organ meat."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 2023 study showed that supplementing a raw diet with which of the following can significantly improve the gut microbiome diversity in dogs?",
            "options": ["Vitamin E", "Prebiotics", "Selenium", "Glucosamine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prebiotics, such as inulin or fructooligosaccharides (FOS), selectively promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, leading to improved microbiome diversity and overall gut health, as demonstrated in a 2023 study. Vitamin E, Selenium, and Glucosamine do not have a similar direct impact on the microbiome."
