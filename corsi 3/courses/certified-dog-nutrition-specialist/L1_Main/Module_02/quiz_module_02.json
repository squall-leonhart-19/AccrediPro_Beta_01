            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of understanding canine nutritional requirements before focusing on specific ratios?",
            "options": ["To memorize vitamin and mineral names.", "To establish a baseline for optimal health and prevent deficiencies or excesses.", "To calculate the cost per serving of dog food.", "To impress other dog owners with nutritional knowledge."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding the foundational nutritional needs of dogs allows for the creation of balanced diets and prevents health issues arising from nutritional imbalances. As covered in L1, a strong foundation is essential before addressing ratios."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons, what is the generally recommended protein percentage range for an active adult dog on a dry matter basis?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "18-25%", "30-40%", "50-60%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L2 discussed the macronutrient ratios and highlighted that active adult dogs generally require a protein percentage in the 18-25% range on a dry matter basis to support their energy needs and muscle maintenance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Why is it important to consider amino acid profiles when determining protein ratios, as discussed in L3?",
            "options": ["Because amino acids are only important for puppies.", "Because an adequate amount of protein doesn't guarantee sufficient amounts of essential amino acids.", "Because amino acids are easily synthesized by the dog's body.", "Because amino acid profiles only affect the taste of the food."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L3 emphasized that even if the overall protein content is adequate, a deficiency in one or more essential amino acids can still occur, leading to health problems. The amino acid profile must be considered for optimal health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "What is the ideal Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acid ratio for dogs, according to the material covered in L4?",
            "options": ["1:5", "5:1", "1:1", "10:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 4,
            "explanation": "L4 highlighted that while specific needs vary, a ratio of approximately 5:1 is generally considered a good starting point, but ratios closer to 2:1 or even 1:1 may be more beneficial for reducing inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following vitamins is fat-soluble and therefore requires careful monitoring to avoid toxicity?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Vitamin B12", "Vitamin K", "Folic Acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L5 discussed that fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) can accumulate in the body, leading to toxicity if over-supplemented. Water-soluble vitamins are generally excreted more readily."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "What is the generally recommended Calcium to Phosphorus ratio for adult dogs, as covered in L6?",
            "options": ["0.5:1", "1:0.5", "1:1 to 2:1", "5:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 explained that the ideal Calcium to Phosphorus ratio for adult dogs is generally considered to be between 1:1 and 2:1 to support bone health and prevent metabolic disorders."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "In the B.A.R.F. framework, what does the acronym stand for?",
            "options": ["Biologically Active Raw Food", "Bones and Raw Food", "Biologically Appropriate Raw Food", "Balanced and Restricted Feeding"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As explained in L7, B.A.R.F. stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food, emphasizing the use of whole, unprocessed foods to meet a dog's nutritional needs."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client is feeding their dog a homemade diet consisting primarily of muscle meat and grains. What is the most likely nutritional deficiency based on the material covered in the case studies in L8?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C deficiency", "Calcium deficiency", "Iron deficiency", "Potassium deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L8 highlighted that diets primarily consisting of muscle meat and grains are often deficient in calcium, as muscle meat is high in phosphorus but low in calcium. This imbalance can lead to bone problems."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "According to the case studies, a puppy is diagnosed with Hyperparathyroidism. This condition is most likely caused by which of the following?",
            "options": ["Excessive Vitamin D supplementation", "A diet with a very low protein content", "An imbalanced calcium to phosphorus ratio in the diet", "Insufficient Omega-3 fatty acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L8 case studies revealed that secondary hyperparathyroidism in puppies is often linked to diets with an imbalanced calcium to phosphorus ratio, typically with too little calcium relative to phosphorus."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "You are consulting with a client whose dog has chronic kidney disease. Based on the principles discussed, what macronutrient adjustment is MOST important to consider?",
            "options": ["Increasing fat intake", "Decreasing protein intake", "Increasing carbohydrate intake", "Maintaining current macronutrient ratios"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the specific needs of dogs with kidney disease vary, L8 case studies show that a moderate reduction in protein intake is often recommended to reduce the workload on the kidneys. This must be done under veterinary supervision."
