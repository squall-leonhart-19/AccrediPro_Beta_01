            "options": ["90% muscle meat, 10% bone", "70% muscle meat, 30% bone", "50% muscle meat, 50% bone", "80% muscle meat, 20% bone"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While ratios can vary based on individual needs, a common starting point is 80% muscle meat and 20% bone to ensure adequate calcium intake and stool consistency."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "When introducing raw food to a dog's diet, what is the recommended initial percentage of raw food compared to their previous diet?",
            "options": ["75% raw, 25% previous diet", "25% raw, 75% previous diet", "50% raw, 50% previous diet", "100% raw immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradually introducing raw food (starting with 25% raw, 75% previous diet) helps the dog's digestive system adapt and minimizes the risk of digestive upset."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 'Functional Follow-up' (F) stage in the B.A.R.F. Framework™?",
            "options": ["To determine the initial food ratios.", "To monitor the dog's response to the raw diet and make necessary adjustments.", "To source new suppliers of raw ingredients.", "To educate clients about the benefits of raw feeding."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Functional Follow-up involves observing the dog's health, energy levels, stool quality, and other indicators to fine-tune the diet for optimal results."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A client expresses concern that raw feeding will expose their dog to harmful bacteria like Salmonella. What is the most accurate and reassuring response, based on the course material?",
            "options": ["All raw food is inherently unsafe and should be avoided.", "Dogs have a shorter digestive tract and more acidic stomach pH than humans, making them naturally more resistant to foodborne bacteria.", "Salmonella is only a concern for puppies and senior dogs.", "Thoroughly cooking the raw food will eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dogs' physiology provides natural protection against many bacteria. Proper handling and sourcing of raw food further minimizes risks."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In a case study presented, a 7-year-old Labrador Retriever named 'Buddy' experienced improved coat quality and reduced allergy symptoms after transitioning to a B.A.R.F. diet. What specific dietary adjustment was MOST likely responsible for these improvements?",
            "options": ["Elimination of all carbohydrates from the diet.", "Increased intake of processed grains and fillers.", "Introduction of a variety of fresh, whole foods and omega-3 fatty acids.", "Reduction in overall protein intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The introduction of fresh, whole foods, particularly those rich in omega-3 fatty acids, is often associated with improved coat quality and reduced allergy symptoms in dogs."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "What is a key consideration when formulating a B.A.R.F. diet for a puppy compared to an adult dog?",
            "options": ["Puppies require a lower percentage of bone in their diet.", "Puppies have lower protein requirements than adult dogs.", "Puppies require a higher calcium-to-phosphorus ratio to support bone growth.", "Puppies do not need supplemental vitamins or minerals."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Puppies require a higher calcium-to-phosphorus ratio (typically around 1.2:1 to 2:1) to support healthy bone development during their rapid growth phase."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A client reports their dog has developed loose stools after starting a B.A.R.F. diet. What is a likely initial adjustment to recommend?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the raw diet.", "Increase the amount of bone in the diet.", "Add more fruits and vegetables to the diet.", "Reduce the amount of bone and ensure proper hydration."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loose stools are often a sign of insufficient bone content. Increasing the bone percentage can help firm up the stool."
