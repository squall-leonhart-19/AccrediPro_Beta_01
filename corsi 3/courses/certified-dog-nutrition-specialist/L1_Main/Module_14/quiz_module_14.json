            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary consideration when determining the appropriate amount of bone to include in a raw diet for a dog?",
            "options": ["The dog's age and activity level", "The dog's breed and size", "The calcium to phosphorus ratio in the bone", "The availability of synthetic vitamin D supplements"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While supplementation can play a role, the availability of synthetic vitamin D is not a primary factor in determining bone inclusion levels. Age, activity, breed, size, and the calcium to phosphorus ratio are all crucial."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson, what is the recommended percentage of organ meat in a raw diet, and which organ should constitute approximately half of that percentage?",
            "options": ["5-10%, with kidney making up half", "10-15%, with liver making up half", "15-20%, with spleen making up half", "20-25%, with pancreas making up half"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The lesson recommends 10-15% organ meat, with liver constituting approximately half of that percentage due to its high nutrient density."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Why is it important to consider the glycemic index (GI) of fruits and vegetables when incorporating them into a raw diet, especially for dogs with specific health conditions?",
            "options": ["To maximize fiber intake for digestive health.", "To minimize the risk of dental issues.", "To manage blood sugar levels, particularly in diabetic dogs.", "To enhance the palatability of the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "For diabetic or insulin-resistant dogs, managing blood sugar levels is crucial. Choosing low-GI fruits and vegetables helps prevent spikes in blood glucose."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A raw-fed dog is consistently experiencing loose stools. Which macronutrient ratio adjustment would be MOST appropriate as a first step, assuming the current diet is balanced in terms of vitamins and minerals?",
            "options": ["Increase fat, decrease protein.", "Increase protein, decrease carbohydrates.", "Increase carbohydrates, decrease fat.", "Increase fiber, decrease fat."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Increasing fat content can help solidify stools in some dogs, while decreasing protein can reduce the workload on the digestive system. Monitor for changes and adjust as needed."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common misconception about raw feeding that was addressed in the lesson?",
            "options": ["Raw feeding is more expensive than kibble feeding.", "Raw feeding is inherently more balanced than kibble feeding.", "Raw feeding always requires supplementation.", "Raw feeding is safe for all dogs regardless of health status."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While raw feeding can be cost-effective with careful planning, it is often perceived as more expensive due to the higher cost of quality ingredients."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson, which supplement might be beneficial for supporting joint health in raw-fed dogs, especially those predisposed to arthritis?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Probiotics", "Vitamin E"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have anti-inflammatory properties that can support joint health in dogs with arthritis."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "What is a primary consideration when transitioning a senior dog to a raw diet, compared to transitioning a younger adult dog?",
            "options": ["Senior dogs require a higher percentage of bone in their diet.", "Senior dogs may have reduced digestive capabilities, requiring a slower transition.", "Senior dogs should be transitioned immediately to avoid digestive upset.", "Senior dogs do not require any transition period."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Senior dogs often have decreased digestive function, making a gradual transition essential to avoid digestive upset and ensure proper nutrient absorption."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Buddy,' a 10-year-old Labrador with a history of pancreatitis, what was a key dietary modification that helped manage his condition while on a raw diet?",
            "options": ["Increasing the carbohydrate content to reduce fat intake.", "Reducing the fat content and providing highly digestible protein sources.", "Eliminating organ meats entirely from the diet.", "Supplementing with high doses of vitamin D."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For Buddy, managing his pancreatitis involved lowering the fat content of his raw diet and focusing on easily digestible protein sources like lean poultry."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A client expresses concern that raw feeding will expose their dog to harmful bacteria like Salmonella. What is the MOST appropriate and evidence-based response?",
            "options": ["Salmonella is not a concern in raw feeding as dogs have a naturally acidic digestive system.", "Proper handling and sourcing of raw meat minimizes the risk, and dogs are generally more resistant to Salmonella than humans.", "All raw meat is guaranteed to contain Salmonella, so the risk is unavoidable.", "The risk of Salmonella is the same as feeding kibble, so there is no increased risk."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the risk of bacterial contamination exists, proper handling and sourcing of high-quality meat significantly reduces the risk. Dogs also possess a more acidic digestive system that helps them tolerate bacteria better than humans."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "When formulating a raw diet for a highly active working dog, which macronutrient should be prioritized to meet their increased energy demands?",
            "options": ["Carbohydrates", "Fiber", "Protein", "Fat"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Highly active working dogs have high energy demands, and fat is the most energy-dense macronutrient, providing more than twice the calories per gram compared to protein or carbohydrates. Prioritizing fat helps meet their energy needs efficiently."
