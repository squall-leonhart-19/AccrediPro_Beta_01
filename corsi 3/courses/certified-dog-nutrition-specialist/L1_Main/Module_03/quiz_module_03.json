            "question": "Which of the following is a core component of a balanced raw diet for dogs, according to the principles discussed in this module?",
            "options": ["Exclusively muscle meat to maximize protein intake.", "A combination of muscle meat, raw meaty bones, and organ meat.", "Primarily plant-based proteins with minimal animal products.", "Cooked grains and vegetables with a small amount of raw meat."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A balanced raw diet should include muscle meat, raw meaty bones (RMBs), and organ meat in appropriate ratios to ensure sufficient nutrient intake. Muscle meat provides protein, RMBs provide calcium and other minerals, and organ meat is a source of vitamins and essential fatty acids."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "What is the generally recommended ratio of raw meaty bones (RMBs) to muscle meat in a raw diet for adult dogs?",
            "options": ["10% RMBs, 90% muscle meat", "50% RMBs, 50% muscle meat", "80% RMBs, 20% muscle meat", "20% RMBs, 80% muscle meat"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A common guideline is to feed approximately 10% raw meaty bones (RMBs) to 90% muscle meat in a raw diet. This ratio aims to provide adequate calcium while preventing excessive bone consumption, which can lead to constipation."

            "question": "You're transitioning a 6-year-old Labrador, 'Buddy,' to a raw diet. He currently eats a kibble diet and has a sensitive stomach. Which approach is MOST recommended for this transition?",
            "options": ["Abruptly switching to a 100% raw diet to quickly introduce new nutrients.", "Fasting for 24 hours before starting the raw diet.", "Gradually introducing small amounts of raw food mixed with his current kibble over 7-10 days.", "Adding digestive enzymes to his kibble for a week, then switching to a 100% raw diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gradual transition, mixing small amounts of raw food with Buddy's current kibble over 7-10 days, is recommended to minimize digestive upset. Abrupt changes can cause diarrhea or vomiting, especially in dogs with sensitive stomachs."

            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when sourcing raw food ingredients?",
            "options": ["Price; selecting the least expensive options to minimize costs.", "Convenience; choosing the easiest to access supplier.", "Quality and safety; ensuring the ingredients are sourced from reputable suppliers with proper handling practices.", "Aesthetics; selecting ingredients that look the most appealing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Quality and safety are paramount. Sourcing from reputable suppliers who adhere to strict hygiene and handling protocols minimizes the risk of bacterial contamination and ensures the nutritional integrity of the ingredients."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "What is the recommended maximum time raw meat should be left at room temperature before it is considered unsafe for consumption by a dog?",
            "options": ["4 hours", "2 hours", "30 minutes", "8 hours"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Raw meat should not be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours to minimize the risk of bacterial growth. In warmer temperatures (above 90°F), this time is reduced to 1 hour."

            "question": "Client 'Luna', a 4-year-old German Shepherd, has been on a raw diet for 6 months but is consistently experiencing soft stools. What is a likely cause and potential solution?",
            "options": ["Too much bone in the diet; reduce the amount of raw meaty bones.", "Not enough fat in the diet; increase the amount of fatty fish.", "Too much organ meat; reduce the amount of organ meat.", "Insufficient protein; increase the amount of muscle meat."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Soft stools can indicate excessive bone consumption. Reducing the proportion of raw meaty bones in Luna's diet can help resolve this issue. Monitor stool consistency and adjust accordingly."

            "id": "q3_7",

            "options": ["Brain (20%)", "Liver (5-10%)", "Kidney (50%)", "Spleen (30%)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Liver is a nutrient-rich organ that should be included in a raw diet, typically making up 5-10% of the total diet. It provides essential vitamins and minerals. Other organs can be included but liver is the most important."

            "question": "What is the primary concern regarding feeding raw poultry to dogs, and how can this risk be mitigated?",
            "options": ["Prion disease; only feed poultry from USDA-inspected facilities.", "Salmonella contamination; practice proper hygiene and handling techniques.", "Avian flu; cook poultry to 165°F before feeding.", "Bone splintering; grind all poultry bones before feeding."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Salmonella is the primary concern with raw poultry. Practicing proper hygiene, such as washing hands and disinfecting surfaces, and sourcing from reputable suppliers minimizes this risk. Studies have shown that healthy dogs can often handle salmonella without showing symptoms, but proper handling is still crucial."

            "question": "According to a 2023 study published in the *Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition*, dogs fed a properly balanced raw diet showed improved digestibility compared to those fed a kibble-based diet. Which of the following is a common indicator of improved digestibility?",
            "options": ["Increased water intake", "Smaller, firmer stools", "Weight gain", "Increased flatulence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Smaller, firmer stools are a common indicator of improved digestibility. This suggests that the dog is absorbing more nutrients from the food and producing less waste."

            "question": "A client expresses concern about the cost of feeding a raw diet. What is a practical recommendation to help them manage expenses while still providing a nutritious raw diet?",
            "options": ["Supplementing with synthetic vitamins to reduce the need for organ meats.", "Sourcing less expensive cuts of meat and supplementing with grains.", "Purchasing in bulk when possible and utilizing less expensive raw meaty bone options like chicken feet or necks.", "Switching to a vegetarian diet with added protein supplements."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Purchasing in bulk and utilizing less expensive raw meaty bone options like chicken feet or necks can significantly reduce costs while still providing essential nutrients. Chicken feet and necks are generally cheaper than other RMBs while still providing calcium and other minerals."
