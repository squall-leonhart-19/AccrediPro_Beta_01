            "question": "When formulating a raw diet for a highly active adult dog, what macronutrient percentage range is generally recommended for fat, considering its energy density?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "10-20%", "20-30%", "30-40%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A fat content of 20-30% is generally recommended for highly active adult dogs to meet their increased energy demands, given that fat provides approximately 2.25 times more energy per gram than carbohydrates or protein."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Which of the following micronutrients is crucial for collagen synthesis and wound healing, and may need careful consideration when formulating a raw diet?",
            "options": ["Vitamin A", "Vitamin C", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin E"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis and wound healing. While organ meats contain some Vitamin C, supplemental sources might be needed, especially in dogs with specific health conditions or increased needs."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual, at what temperature should raw meat be stored to minimize the risk of bacterial growth?",
            "options": ["Above 40°F (4°C)", "Between 32°F (0°C) and 40°F (4°C)", "Below 40°F (4°C)", "Below 20°F (-6.7°C)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Raw meat should be stored below 40°F (4°C) to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli, as outlined in the FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "What is the primary concern regarding the feeding of cooked bones to dogs?",
            "options": ["Increased calcium absorption", "Decreased risk of bacterial contamination", "Potential for splintering and causing internal damage", "Enhanced digestibility"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cooking bones alters their structure, making them brittle and prone to splintering. These splinters can cause serious internal damage to the dog's digestive tract."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Which organ meat is particularly rich in Vitamin D and essential fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to a raw diet?",
            "options": ["Liver", "Kidney", "Brain", "Spleen"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Liver is a nutritional powerhouse, containing high levels of Vitamin D, Vitamin A, and essential fatty acids. It should be included in moderation due to its richness."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A client expresses concern about the risk of bacterial contamination from raw food. Which of the following is the MOST effective way to address this concern?",
            "options": ["Recommending a fully cooked diet instead", "Educating the client on proper handling, storage, and sanitation practices", "Advising the client to only purchase raw food from large commercial suppliers", "Suggesting the addition of antibiotics to the raw diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Educating clients on safe handling practices is the most effective way to mitigate the risk of bacterial contamination. This includes proper storage, thawing, preparation, and sanitation of food bowls and surfaces."

            "question": "When transitioning a dog to a raw diet, what is the recommended initial percentage of raw food compared to their previous diet?",
            "options": ["25%", "50%", "75%", "100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Starting with 25% raw food mixed with their previous diet allows the dog's digestive system to gradually adapt to the new food, minimizing the risk of digestive upset."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "During a long-term follow-up, you notice a dog on a raw diet has consistently elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. What dietary adjustment might be necessary?",
            "options": ["Increase the amount of organ meat", "Reduce the protein content", "Increase the fat content", "Supplement with calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated BUN levels can indicate that the kidneys are working harder to process protein. Reducing the protein content in the diet may help alleviate this issue."

            "question": "A 3-year-old Labrador presents with chronic pancreatitis. What is the MOST important macronutrient consideration when formulating a raw diet for this dog?",
            "options": ["High carbohydrate content", "Low fat content", "High fiber content", "High protein content"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For dogs with pancreatitis, a diet with a low fat content is crucial, as fat can exacerbate pancreatic inflammation. Protein should be moderate and highly digestible."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client reports their dog is experiencing loose stools after transitioning to a raw diet. What is the FIRST dietary adjustment you should recommend?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch back to the previous diet", "Increase the bone content", "Decrease the organ meat content", "Add a probiotic supplement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Loose stools can be a sign of too little bone content in the diet. Bone helps to firm up stools. Increasing the bone content slightly is often the first and easiest adjustment to make."
