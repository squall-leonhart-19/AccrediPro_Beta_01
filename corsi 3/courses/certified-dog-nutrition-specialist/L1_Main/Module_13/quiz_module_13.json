            "question": "When formulating a raw diet for a puppy, what is the generally recommended percentage of calcium to phosphorus in the diet?",
            "options": ["1:2", "1:1", "1.2:1 to 2:1", "3:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Puppies require a higher calcium to phosphorus ratio for bone development, typically between 1.2:1 and 2:1."

            "question": "A senior dog presents with osteoarthritis. Which of the following supplements, at an evidence-backed dosage, would be MOST appropriate to incorporate into their raw diet?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C (500mg)", "Glucosamine and Chondroitin (as indicated on product label)", "Zinc (10mg)", "Spirulina (1g)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glucosamine and chondroitin are commonly used and supported by studies for managing osteoarthritis in dogs by supporting cartilage health. Vitamin C, Zinc, and Spirulina have other benefits but are not the primary choice for osteoarthritis."

            "question": "Which type of novel protein is LEAST likely to cause an allergic reaction in dogs who have developed sensitivities to common proteins like chicken and beef?",
            "options": ["Lamb", "Venison", "Duck", "Pork"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Venison is often considered a novel protein because it's less commonly found in commercial dog foods, reducing the likelihood of prior exposure and subsequent allergic reaction. Lamb, duck and pork are becoming more commonly used in commercial diets."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to studies discussed in the Gut Microbiome lesson, how does a raw diet generally impact the gut microbiome diversity compared to a kibble-based diet?",
            "options": ["Significantly decreases diversity", "Slightly decreases diversity", "No significant impact", "Generally increases diversity"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that raw diets tend to promote a more diverse gut microbiome compared to kibble, which can have positive implications for overall health."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Offering bones that are appropriately sized for the dog is crucial to prevent choking hazards or other injuries. Cooked bones should never be given."

            "question": "A dog diagnosed with cancer is undergoing chemotherapy. Which dietary adjustment is MOST appropriate to support their nutritional needs during treatment?",
            "options": ["Reducing protein intake to ease kidney function", "Increasing carbohydrate intake for quick energy", "Focusing on highly digestible protein and healthy fats", "Restricting all fats to minimize inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cancer and chemotherapy increase the need for high quality protein and healthy fats to support immune function and maintain muscle mass. Highly digestible protein is easier on the system. Carbohydrates are not the best source of energy for cancer patients."
