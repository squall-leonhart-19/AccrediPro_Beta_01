            "question": "A 7-year-old neutered male Labrador Retriever presents with a Body Condition Score (BCS) of 7/9. Which initial dietary adjustment is MOST appropriate according to the AAHA guidelines discussed in the canine obesity module?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch to a raw food diet.", "Increase the dog's current food portion by 25%.", "Reduce the dog's current food portion by 25-30% and increase exercise.", "Switch to a high-fat, grain-free diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to AAHA guidelines, a 25-30% reduction in current food intake combined with increased exercise is a safe and effective starting point for weight loss in obese dogs. Sudden dietary changes can cause digestive upset."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client reports their dog experiences chronic, non-seasonal pruritus, diarrhea, and recurrent ear infections. An elimination diet is recommended. What is the MINIMUM trial period typically required to assess improvement in these clinical signs?",
            "options": ["1 week", "2 weeks", "4-6 weeks", "8-12 weeks"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elimination diets typically require a trial period of 4-6 weeks to accurately assess improvement in clinical signs associated with food sensitivities and allergies. This allows sufficient time for the body to clear potential allergens and for inflammation to subside."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A dog with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requires a diet modification. What is the MOST important nutrient to restrict in their diet to slow disease progression, according to the IRIS guidelines?",
            "options": ["Phosphorus", "Sodium", "Protein", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Phosphorus restriction is a cornerstone of CKD management. High phosphorus levels exacerbate kidney damage. While protein and sodium also need to be carefully managed, phosphorus is the priority."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which of the following nutritional recommendations is MOST appropriate for a dog undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma, based on research into cancer cachexia?",
            "options": ["A high-carbohydrate diet to provide readily available energy.", "A diet severely restricted in protein to minimize tumor growth.", "A diet high in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs).", "A diet supplemented with high doses of vitamin C."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) and MCTs have shown promise in managing cancer cachexia by reducing inflammation and providing readily available energy. High carbohydrate diets can fuel tumor growth, and severe protein restriction is generally not recommended."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A dog diagnosed with acute pancreatitis is recovering and ready to transition back to oral feeding. Which feeding strategy is MOST appropriate during the initial stages of reintroduction?",
            "options": ["Offer a large meal of the dog's regular diet.", "Offer small, frequent meals of a highly digestible, low-fat diet.", "Immediately switch to a raw food diet to support gut health.", "Withhold food for another 24 hours, then offer a normal-sized meal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small, frequent meals of a highly digestible, low-fat diet minimize pancreatic stimulation and allow the digestive system to gradually return to normal function after a bout of pancreatitis. Large meals or sudden dietary changes can trigger a relapse."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A German Shepherd presents with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and coprophagia. Fecal elastase testing confirms Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI). Which dietary modification is MOST critical for managing EPI?",
            "options": ["Supplementation with prebiotics to improve gut flora.", "Supplementation with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and a highly digestible diet.", "A high-fiber diet to bulk up the stool.", "A grain-free diet to reduce carbohydrate intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is essential for managing EPI, as it provides the enzymes the pancreas is no longer producing. A highly digestible diet reduces the burden on the digestive system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A Border Collie with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is experiencing frequent flare-ups despite being on a hydrolyzed protein diet. Which of the following dietary strategies might be considered NEXT, according to current research?",
            "options": ["Switching to a high-fat ketogenic diet.", "Implementing a novel protein diet or an elemental diet.", "Adding large amounts of insoluble fiber to the diet.", "Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a hydrolyzed protein diet is not effective, a novel protein diet (using a protein source the dog has never been exposed to) or an elemental diet (containing amino acids, rather than whole proteins) may be considered. These options minimize the risk of triggering an immune response in the gut."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "An 11-year-old Golden Retriever is showing signs of cognitive dysfunction, including disorientation and altered sleep-wake cycles. Which dietary addition is MOST likely to provide cognitive support based on current geriatric nutrition guidelines?",
            "options": ["Increased protein intake to maintain muscle mass.", "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) to provide an alternative energy source for the brain.", "High levels of calcium to support bone health.", "Increased fiber to prevent constipation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) have been shown to improve cognitive function in older dogs by providing an alternative energy source for brain cells. While protein, calcium, and fiber are important for geriatric dogs, MCTs specifically target cognitive health."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "You are advising a client whose dog has both Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and food sensitivities. The dog is currently on a renal diet but is showing signs of skin irritation. Which is the MOST appropriate FIRST step in addressing this complex scenario?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch to a raw food diet.", "Add a high dose of corticosteroids to manage the skin irritation.", "Consult with a veterinary dermatologist and consider a hydrolyzed or novel protein renal diet.", "Discontinue the renal diet and focus solely on managing the food sensitivities."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the renal diet is crucial for managing CKD, and the skin irritation needs to be addressed without exacerbating the kidney condition. Switching to a diet that is both renal-friendly and formulated with hydrolyzed or novel proteins can address both conditions simultaneously. Consulting a veterinary dermatologist can help guide the dietary choice."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A dog recovering from pancreatitis is also overweight. How should the dietary fat restriction be managed during the weight loss process?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminate fat from the diet until the dog reaches its ideal weight.", "Gradually reduce fat intake while ensuring adequate protein and fiber to promote satiety and prevent muscle loss.", "Maintain a high-fat diet to support energy levels during exercise.", "Focus solely on reducing carbohydrate intake, as carbohydrates are the primary cause of weight gain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual fat reduction, combined with adequate protein and fiber, is essential for safe and effective weight loss in dogs with a history of pancreatitis. Complete fat elimination is not necessary or healthy. Adequate protein helps maintain muscle mass, and fiber promotes satiety, both of which are important for successful weight management."
