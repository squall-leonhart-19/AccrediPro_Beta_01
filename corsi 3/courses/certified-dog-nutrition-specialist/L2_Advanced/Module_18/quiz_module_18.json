            "id": "q18_1",
            "question": "When interpreting a complex case history, which of the following is MOST crucial to identify FIRST?",
            "options": ["The client's budget for supplements.", "The dog's favorite protein source.", "The primary presenting symptom and its timeline.", "The breed's predisposition to certain diseases."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying the primary presenting symptom and its timeline provides a focal point for your investigation and helps prioritize potential underlying issues. This is the foundation for a structured assessment."

        {
            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A client reports their dog, Max (age 7, neutered male), initially thrived on a raw diet but now exhibits intermittent diarrhea and vomiting. A recent fecal test is negative. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate FIRST step in refining your balance assessment?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch to a hydrolyzed protein diet.", "Re-evaluate the A.R.F. ratios and potential intolerances.", "Administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic.", "Recommend a fiber supplement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Re-evaluating the ratios (A.R.F.) and potential intolerances (e.g., a newly developed sensitivity) is the most logical first step before resorting to more drastic measures. The problem may be an imbalance or an emerging sensitivity, not necessarily a disease."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to Dr. Billinghurst's original B.A.R.F. model, what is the approximate recommended ratio of meat/muscle meat to bones to organs?",
            "options": ["80% meat/muscle meat, 10% bones, 10% organs", "70% meat/muscle meat, 20% bones, 10% organs", "60% meat/muscle meat, 30% bones, 10% organs", "90% meat/muscle meat, 5% bones, 5% organs"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The original B.A.R.F. model typically recommends approximately 80% meat/muscle meat, 10% bones, and 10% organs. However, this is just a starting point, and adjustments should be made based on individual needs."

            "question": "When transitioning a dog with a history of pancreatitis to a raw diet, which of the following considerations is MOST important?",
            "options": ["Introducing high-fat meats immediately to stimulate enzyme production.", "Starting with very small portions of lean protein and gradually increasing fat content.", "Avoiding all fat sources and relying solely on carbohydrates.", "Adding pancreatic enzyme supplements indefinitely."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dogs with a history of pancreatitis require a gradual introduction to fat. Starting with lean protein and slowly increasing fat content minimizes the risk of triggering another episode. Sudden high-fat intake can be problematic."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "In a functional follow-up, what is the MOST reliable indicator of a successful dietary change for a dog with chronic skin allergies?",
            "options": ["The owner's subjective assessment of the dog's energy levels.", "A significant reduction in itching, inflammation, and secondary infections, confirmed by veterinary examination.", "Complete resolution of all symptoms within one week.", "Weight gain, regardless of other symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While owner assessment is valuable, objective indicators like reduced itching, inflammation, and confirmed improvement by a veterinarian are the most reliable signs of success in managing skin allergies. Complete resolution in a week is unrealistic."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "A 10-year-old Labrador Retriever presents with concurrent osteoarthritis and early-stage kidney disease. Which of the following dietary adjustments is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Increase protein intake to support muscle mass, regardless of kidney function.", "Moderately restrict phosphorus and protein while providing omega-3 fatty acids for joint support.", "Eliminate all protein sources to reduce kidney strain.", "Focus solely on glucosamine and chondroitin supplements."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Managing multi-morbidity requires balancing competing needs. Moderately restricting phosphorus and protein is crucial for kidney health, while omega-3 fatty acids can help manage osteoarthritis. Extreme measures are generally not advisable."

            "options": ["Immediately switch back to a commercial dry food.", "Thoroughly review the diet for potential toxins, imbalances, or deficiencies and consult with a veterinarian.", "Administer a liver detoxification supplement.", "Assume the raw diet is the cause and discontinue it."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated liver enzymes require investigation. A thorough review of the diet and consultation with a veterinarian are necessary to rule out toxins, imbalances, or other underlying health issues before making drastic changes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The AVMA emphasizes the importance of veterinarians being informed and prepared to discuss the risks and benefits of raw food diets with clients, allowing for informed decision-making. Complete avoidance or blanket endorsement are not ethically sound approaches."
