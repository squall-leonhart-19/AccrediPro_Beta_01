            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in assessing a woman presenting with perimenopausal symptoms?",
            "options": ["Ordering a comprehensive hormone panel", "Administering a standardized symptom rating scale", "Taking a comprehensive menopause history", "Performing a pelvic exam"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive menopause history, including menstrual cycle changes, vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbances, mood changes, and sexual function, provides the foundational information needed before further testing or assessment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A 52-year-old client, Sarah, reports experiencing hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep disturbances. Which symptom rating scale would be MOST appropriate to initially quantify the severity of these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Greene Climacteric Scale", "Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)", "Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)", "Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) is specifically designed to assess the severity of common menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep disturbances, making it an ideal initial choice."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson, what is a significant limitation of relying solely on FSH levels to diagnose menopause?",
            "options": ["FSH levels are highly accurate and reliable", "FSH levels fluctuate significantly during perimenopause", "FSH levels are not affected by hormone replacement therapy", "FSH levels are the gold standard for diagnosing menopause"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FSH levels can fluctuate significantly during perimenopause, making a single measurement unreliable for diagnosing menopause. A series of measurements or consideration of other factors is necessary."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A DEXA scan is MOST important for assessing which of the following in a postmenopausal woman?",
            "options": ["Cardiovascular risk", "Cognitive function", "Bone mineral density", "Pelvic floor strength"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DEXA scans are the gold standard for measuring bone mineral density and assessing the risk of osteoporosis, a significant concern for postmenopausal women."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which of the following cognitive screening tools is particularly useful for identifying mild cognitive impairment in perimenopausal women?",
            "options": ["Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)", "Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)", "Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)", "Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is more sensitive than the MMSE for detecting subtle cognitive changes associated with perimenopause and mild cognitive impairment."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A 58-year-old woman reports urinary incontinence and pelvic pressure. Which assessment tool would be MOST appropriate to evaluate her pelvic floor function?",
            "options": ["Visual Analog Scale (VAS)", "Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20)", "Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Calculator", "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) is a validated questionnaire specifically designed to assess the severity and impact of pelvic floor disorders, including urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Which biomarker provides information regarding ovarian reserve and may be useful in assessing reproductive aging, particularly in women experiencing irregular cycles?",
            "options": ["Estradiol", "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)", "Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH)", "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) is a reliable marker of ovarian reserve and can provide valuable information about reproductive aging, especially in women with irregular menstrual cycles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "According to the lesson, what is the primary benefit of integrating data from multiple assessment tools when creating a personalized treatment plan?",
            "options": ["It simplifies the treatment process", "It provides a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's needs", "It reduces the need for follow-up appointments", "It eliminates the possibility of misdiagnosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating data from various assessments allows for a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the patient's symptoms, risk factors, and overall health status, leading to a more effective and personalized treatment plan."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client's hormone test results show elevated FSH and low estradiol levels. Her MRS score indicates moderate vasomotor symptoms. She also reports symptoms of anxiety and mild depression based on the HADS. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in creating a personalized treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Prescribe HRT solely based on hormone levels", "Refer her to a psychiatrist for medication management", "Consider HRT in conjunction with lifestyle modifications and potentially referral to a therapist", "Recommend over-the-counter remedies without further evaluation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the combination of hormonal changes, vasomotor symptoms, and mood symptoms, a comprehensive approach is needed. HRT may be appropriate for symptom management, but lifestyle modifications and potentially therapy should also be considered to address anxiety and depression."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "What is a key consideration when interpreting the results of biomarker testing for cardiovascular risk in perimenopausal women?",
            "options": ["Biomarker levels are always indicative of immediate cardiovascular events", "Hormonal changes during perimenopause can influence lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk markers", "Biomarker testing is unnecessary in women without a family history of heart disease", "Biomarker testing is a replacement for traditional cardiovascular risk assessment tools"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause can impact lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk markers, making it crucial to consider these changes when interpreting biomarker results and assessing cardiovascular risk."
