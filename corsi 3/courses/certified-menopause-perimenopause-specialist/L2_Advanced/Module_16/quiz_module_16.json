            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the case of 'Eleanor,' experiencing surgical menopause at age 42 due to a hysterectomy, which of the following HRT regimens would be MOST appropriate initially, considering her uterus has been removed?",
            "options": ["Continuous combined estrogen and progestogen therapy", "Cyclical estrogen and progestogen therapy", "Estrogen-only therapy", "Progestogen-only therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen-only therapy is most appropriate post-hysterectomy because there is no need to protect the endometrium from estrogen-induced hyperplasia."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "According to the case study involving 'Grace,' who presents with late perimenopause and cognitive decline, what is the FIRST-LINE intervention recommended to address her cognitive symptoms, assuming no contraindications?",
            "options": ["Cholinesterase inhibitors", "Hormone therapy", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)", "Ginkgo biloba supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormone therapy, specifically estrogen, is often considered a first-line intervention for cognitive symptoms arising during the menopause transition, assuming no contraindications exist, as discussed in Grace's case."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In managing 'Patricia,' who experiences GSM, what is the recommended initial treatment for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, before considering systemic hormone therapy?",
            "options": ["Systemic estrogen therapy", "Vaginal estrogen cream", "Oral selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)", "Testosterone therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vaginal estrogen cream is the recommended initial treatment for GSM due to its localized effect and minimal systemic absorption, as highlighted in Patricia's case."

            "question": "Considering 'Margaret,' who is experiencing menopause and metabolic syndrome, which lifestyle intervention is MOST critical to address first to mitigate cardiovascular risk?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adopting a Mediterranean diet is most critical to address first due to its proven benefits in improving lipid profiles, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk in individuals with metabolic syndrome."

            "options": ["Acupuncture sessions thrice weekly", "Regular yoga and meditation practice", "Melatonin supplementation before bedtime", "Rigorous daytime exercise"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["Estrogen", "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)", "Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)", "Progesterone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) should be monitored most closely in conjunction with menopause symptoms due to the autoimmune comorbidity of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which can significantly impact thyroid function."
