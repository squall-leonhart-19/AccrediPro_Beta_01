            "question": "According to the FLOURISH framework, which of the following domains focuses on improving sleep quality and managing sleep disturbances?",
            "options": ["Fulfillment", "Lifestyle", "Outlook", "Underlying Health"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Lifestyle' domain of the FLOURISH framework specifically addresses lifestyle factors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise, which are crucial for overall well-being during perimenopause and menopause."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A 52-year-old client reports experiencing vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) that are significantly impacting her daily life. Her medical history includes a previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate initial treatment approach?",
            "options": ["Oral estrogen therapy", "Transdermal estrogen therapy", "Low-dose SSRI", "Bioidentical hormone therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the client's history of DVT, estrogen therapy carries a higher risk. Low-dose SSRIs, such as paroxetine, are a non-hormonal option that can effectively manage vasomotor symptoms. Transdermal estrogen could be considered, but only after careful evaluation of risks and benefits."

            "question": "Which of the following bone density T-scores indicates osteopenia, according to WHO criteria?",
            "options": ["-1.0 or higher", "Between -1.0 and -2.5", "-2.5 or lower", "0"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 indicates osteopenia, signifying lower-than-normal bone density but not yet osteoporosis. A T-score of -2.5 or lower indicates osteoporosis."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary recommendations is MOST important for maintaining bone health during perimenopause and menopause?",
            "options": ["Reducing carbohydrate intake", "Increasing saturated fat intake", "Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake", "Avoiding all dairy products"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are crucial for bone health. Calcium is a building block for bone, and vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium. Other dietary factors are less directly related to bone health."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "A 55-year-old woman presents with complaints of memory problems and difficulty concentrating since entering menopause. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescription of a cholinesterase inhibitor", "Recommending cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and lifestyle modifications", "Initiation of high-dose estrogen therapy", "Referral for immediate neurological evaluation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT and lifestyle modifications (e.g., regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress management) are generally considered first-line interventions for cognitive complaints related to menopause. Estrogen therapy is not a primary treatment for cognitive decline and has potential risks. A neurological evaluation may be warranted if symptoms are severe or atypical."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study indicated that approximately 40-50% of women experience sleep disturbances during perimenopause, highlighting the prevalence of this symptom."

            "question": "Which of the following statements accurately reflects the ethical considerations regarding hormone therapy (HT) during menopause?",
            "options": ["It is always unethical to prescribe HT due to potential risks.", "The patient's preferences and values should not influence the decision to prescribe HT.", "A thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of HT, along with shared decision-making, is essential.", "HT should be prescribed solely based on the physician's judgment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires a comprehensive discussion of the risks and benefits of HT, ensuring the patient is fully informed and participates in the decision-making process. This aligns with the principles of autonomy and beneficence."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A 60-year-old postmenopausal woman has been taking hormone therapy (HT) for 10 years to manage vasomotor symptoms. Her symptoms are well-controlled, and she is otherwise healthy. What is the MOST appropriate recommendation regarding her HT?",
            "options": ["Continue HT indefinitely, as long as symptoms are controlled.", "Discontinue HT immediately to minimize potential risks.", "Gradually taper the HT dose and reassess symptoms.", "Switch to a higher dose of HT to prevent symptom recurrence."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the potential risks associated with long-term HT use, a gradual tapering of the dose is generally recommended, followed by reassessment of symptoms. Abrupt discontinuation can lead to symptom rebound. Continuous use indefinitely is not generally recommended."

            "options": ["Systemic estrogen therapy", "Vaginal estrogen therapy", "Oral ospemifene", "Systemic progestin therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vaginal estrogen therapy is typically the first-line treatment for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia because it directly addresses the local estrogen deficiency in the vaginal tissues. Systemic estrogen is not always necessary for isolated vaginal symptoms."

            "id": "q21_10",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weight-bearing exercise offers multiple benefits, including improving bone density, muscle strength, mood, and sleep quality, all of which are important during menopause. It is a safe and effective intervention for most women."
