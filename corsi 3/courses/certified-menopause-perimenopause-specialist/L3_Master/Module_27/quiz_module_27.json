            "question": "Which of the following autoimmune conditions is most commonly associated with an increased risk of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)?",
            "options": ["Rheumatoid arthritis", "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", "Hashimoto's thyroiditis", "Type 1 diabetes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland, is the most commonly associated autoimmune condition with an increased risk of POI. Studies suggest a shared autoimmune mechanism affecting both the thyroid and ovaries."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 52-year-old woman, post-menopausal for 3 years, presents with concerns about cognitive decline. She has a history of breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and tamoxifen. Which cognitive assessment tool would be MOST appropriate as an initial screening?",
            "options": ["Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)", "Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)", "Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS)", "Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is generally considered more sensitive than the MMSE for detecting mild cognitive impairment, which is more likely in early stages of cognitive decline and relevant for post-menopausal women, especially cancer survivors. The SLUMS is a good alternative. The ADAS-Cog is more suitable for assessing moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which estrogen is thought to protect against cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women?",
            "options": ["Increased LDL cholesterol levels", "Vasodilation and improved endothelial function", "Increased blood pressure", "Promotion of blood clot formation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Estrogen promotes vasodilation by increasing nitric oxide production, leading to improved endothelial function and reduced risk of atherosclerosis. It also has a positive effect on lipid profiles, typically lowering LDL cholesterol and increasing HDL cholesterol."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "According to the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), what is the recommended first-line treatment for vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) in perimenopausal women without contraindications?",
            "options": ["Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)", "Gabapentin", "Estrogen therapy", "Lifestyle modifications (e.g., cooling techniques)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NAMS guidelines recommend estrogen therapy as the most effective first-line treatment for vasomotor symptoms in perimenopausal women without contraindications. While lifestyle modifications and other medications can help, estrogen provides the most significant relief."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A 48-year-old woman reports significant weight gain during perimenopause. She states she has been eating the same diet and exercising regularly. Which hormonal change is MOST likely contributing to her weight gain?",
            "options": ["Increased testosterone", "Decreased cortisol", "Decreased estrogen", "Increased thyroid hormone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Decreasing estrogen levels during perimenopause can lead to decreased metabolic rate and increased fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. This hormonal shift contributes to weight gain even without changes in diet or exercise."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "What is the most common sexual complaint reported by women during perimenopause and postmenopause?",
            "options": ["Increased libido", "Vaginal dryness", "Painful intercourse", "Decreased clitoral sensitivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vaginal dryness, due to decreased estrogen levels, is the most common sexual complaint. This can lead to dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and decreased libido."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A 55-year-old breast cancer survivor, currently on an aromatase inhibitor, presents with severe vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Which of the following treatments is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Systemic estrogen therapy", "Vaginal estrogen therapy", "Ospemifene", "Vaginal moisturizers and lubricants"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Given the patient's history of breast cancer and current aromatase inhibitor use, systemic estrogen therapy and ospemifene are generally contraindicated due to potential risks of breast cancer recurrence. Although vaginal estrogen therapy may be considered in consultation with her oncologist, vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are the safest first-line option for managing vaginal dryness and dyspareunia."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Which of the following statements regarding the use of antidepressants for managing mood symptoms during perimenopause is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["SSRIs are ineffective for treating mood symptoms associated with perimenopause.", "Hormone therapy is always superior to antidepressants for treating mood symptoms.", "SSRIs can be effective for treating mood symptoms and vasomotor symptoms concurrently.", "Antidepressants should only be used after hormone therapy has failed."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "SSRIs can be effective for treating mood symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, that are associated with perimenopause. Some SSRIs, such as paroxetine, can also help reduce vasomotor symptoms. They are a valuable alternative for women who cannot or choose not to use hormone therapy."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A healthcare provider prescribes compounded bioidentical hormone therapy (cBHT) to a patient experiencing menopausal symptoms. Which ethical concern is MOST relevant in this scenario?",
            "options": ["cBHT is always more effective than FDA-approved hormone therapy.", "cBHT is regulated by the FDA in the same way as other hormone therapies.", "cBHT formulations may lack standardization and quality control.", "cBHT is less expensive than FDA-approved hormone therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compounded bioidentical hormone therapies (cBHT) often lack the rigorous standardization and quality control measures applied to FDA-approved hormone therapies. This raises ethical concerns about potential inconsistencies in dosage and purity, which can impact patient safety and treatment effectiveness."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "According to the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW +10) criteria, what hormonal marker is MOST useful in confirming the final menstrual period and the transition to postmenopause?",
            "options": ["Elevated estradiol", "Decreased FSH", "Consistently elevated FSH", "Decreased LH"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While symptoms are key, consistently elevated FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) levels, in conjunction with 12 months of amenorrhea, are useful in confirming the menopausal transition according to STRAW +10 criteria. However, FSH is not always necessary for diagnosis."
