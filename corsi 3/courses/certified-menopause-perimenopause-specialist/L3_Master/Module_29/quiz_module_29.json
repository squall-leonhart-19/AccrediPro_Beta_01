            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step when applying the FLOURISH framework to a complex perimenopause case?",
            "options": ["Ordering comprehensive hormone panels.", "Assessing the client's overall functional capacity and limitations.", "Immediately initiating hormone therapy based on reported symptoms.", "Recommending a specific diet and exercise plan."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The FLOURISH framework emphasizes a holistic assessment, prioritizing the client's functional capacity and limitations before focusing on specific interventions or lab results."

            "question": "A 52-year-old client taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism reports experiencing new-onset anxiety and insomnia. Her estradiol level is 35 pg/mL. Which drug interaction is MOST important to consider?",
            "options": ["Estradiol potentially decreasing the effectiveness of levothyroxine.", "Levothyroxine potentially increasing the risk of estrogen-related side effects.", "Estradiol potentially increasing the risk of levothyroxine-related side effects.", "Levothyroxine potentially decreasing the effectiveness of estradiol."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Estrogen can decrease the effectiveness of levothyroxine, requiring a dosage adjustment. Monitoring thyroid function is crucial in women undergoing hormone therapy while taking thyroid medication. A 2018 study in the *Journal of Women's Health* highlighted this interaction."

            "question": "A 48-year-old client reports persistent depressive symptoms despite being on a stable dose of an SSRI. She also experiences significant vasomotor symptoms. What is the MOST appropriate next step in her management?",
            "options": ["Increasing the dose of the SSRI.", "Adding a benzodiazepine for anxiety.", "Assessing hormone levels and considering hormone therapy, if appropriate.", "Recommending St. John's Wort."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the presence of both depressive and vasomotor symptoms, assessing hormone levels and considering hormone therapy is crucial, as hormonal fluctuations can contribute to mood disorders during perimenopause. A 2021 meta-analysis in *JAMA Psychiatry* supports this approach."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The best response uses empathy and open-ended questions to explore the client's ambivalence and facilitate their own exploration of solutions, aligning with the core principles of motivational interviewing."

The International Headache Society recommends caution with estrogen use in these patients."
