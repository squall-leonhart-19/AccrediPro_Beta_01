A 2014 meta-analysis in 'Menopause' found a significant association between physical activity and reduced vasomotor symptoms."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client is considering hormone therapy. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Which hormone therapy regimen is generally considered the SAFEST option, if hormone therapy is deemed necessary, after careful consideration of risks and benefits?",
            "options": ["Oral estrogen", "Transdermal estrogen", "Intramuscular estrogen", "Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transdermal estrogen is generally considered safer for women with a history of DVT compared to oral estrogen because it bypasses the first-pass metabolism in the liver, reducing the risk of blood clot formation.  Guidelines from the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) support this recommendation."

            "options": ["Black cohosh is consistently proven to be more effective than hormone therapy for hot flashes.", "The efficacy of black cohosh is supported by robust, high-quality evidence from multiple large-scale trials.", "The evidence on black cohosh is mixed, with some studies showing benefit for hot flashes and others showing no effect.", "Black cohosh is known to cause severe liver damage and should be avoided."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The evidence surrounding black cohosh is mixed. Some studies suggest a potential benefit for reducing hot flashes, while others show no significant effect compared to placebo. More research is needed to determine its true efficacy and safety. A Cochrane review highlights this uncertainty."

            "question": "A client sets a goal to lose 20 pounds in 2 months to alleviate joint pain. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately support the client's goal and provide a strict diet plan.", "Encourage the client to aim for a more realistic and sustainable goal, such as 1-2 pounds per week.", "Tell the client that weight loss is not effective for joint pain.", "Recommend an extreme exercise program to accelerate weight loss."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Setting realistic goals is crucial for client motivation and success. Aiming for 1-2 pounds of weight loss per week is a more sustainable and achievable goal than 20 pounds in 2 months.
