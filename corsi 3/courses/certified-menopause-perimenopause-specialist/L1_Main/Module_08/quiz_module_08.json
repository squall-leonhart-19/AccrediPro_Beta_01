            "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between estrogen and progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": ["Estrogen levels are consistently higher than progesterone levels.", "Progesterone levels peak, supporting the uterine lining, while estrogen levels remain relatively stable.", "Estrogen and progesterone levels rise and fall in perfect synchrony.", "Progesterone levels are negligible, while estrogen dominates."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During the luteal phase, progesterone levels rise significantly to prepare and maintain the uterine lining for potential implantation. Estrogen also plays a role, but progesterone is the dominant hormone during this phase."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lifestyle modifications are generally the first-line approach for managing menopausal symptoms. While hormone therapy may be considered, it's not the initial step for all women. Elevated FSH levels confirm she is in menopause."
