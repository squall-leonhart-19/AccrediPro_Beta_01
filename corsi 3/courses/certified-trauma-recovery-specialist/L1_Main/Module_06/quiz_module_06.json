            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring of traumatic memories", "Re-experiencing the traumatic event in detail", "Titration and pendulation to regulate arousal", "Complete dissociation from bodily sensations"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SE emphasizes titration (small, manageable doses of trauma-related sensation) and pendulation (alternating between trauma-related sensations and safe resources) to help regulate arousal and complete defensive responses."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Epigenetic inheritance refers to changes in gene expression (without altering the DNA sequence itself) caused by environmental factors, such as trauma, that can be passed down to subsequent generations."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
