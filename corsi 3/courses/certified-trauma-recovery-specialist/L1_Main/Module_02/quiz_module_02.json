            "question": "Which brain region is MOST directly associated with the fear response and the formation of emotional memories following a traumatic event?",
            "options": ["Prefrontal Cortex", "Hippocampus", "Amygdala", "Cerebellum"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The amygdala plays a central role in processing emotions, particularly fear, and is heavily involved in the formation of emotional memories associated with trauma. Research indicates increased amygdala activity following traumatic experiences."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently attributes negative events to her own shortcomings and generalizes these beliefs across various situations. This cognitive distortion is MOST likely associated with:",
            "options": ["Hyperarousal", "Avoidance", "Learned Helplessness", "Emotional Numbness"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Learned helplessness describes the belief that one's actions have no impact on outcomes, leading to feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness.  This often manifests as attributing negative events to personal flaws and generalizing these beliefs."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "When introducing the concept of the 'Window of Tolerance' to a client, it is MOST important to emphasize that:",
            "options": ["The goal is to permanently expand the window to encompass all emotional experiences.", "Experiences outside the window are inherently negative and should be avoided.", "The window is a fixed and unchangeable aspect of their nervous system.", "The window represents the optimal zone for processing information and managing emotions effectively."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Window of Tolerance represents the zone where individuals can effectively process information, manage emotions, and function optimally. While expanding the window is a goal, it's important to recognize that fluctuations are normal and experiences outside the window are not inherently negative."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which of the following phrases is the MOST appropriate example of trauma-informed language when discussing a client's past experiences?",
            "options": ["'What's wrong with you that you reacted that way?'", "'Tell me about the incident that caused your trauma.'", "'What happened to you?'", "'Why didn't you report it sooner?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "'What happened to you?' is an example of trauma-informed language, shifting the focus from blaming the individual to understanding the experiences they have endured. This approach promotes safety and trust in the therapeutic relationship."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "According to attachment theory, inconsistent or unpredictable caregiving in early childhood is MOST likely to result in which attachment style?",
            "options": ["Secure Attachment", "Avoidant Attachment", "Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment", "Disorganized Attachment"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment often arises from inconsistent or frightening caregiving experiences.  Children in these situations lack a coherent strategy for seeking comfort and may exhibit contradictory behaviors."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing vivid flashbacks of a traumatic event. Which brain structure is MOST likely implicated in the intrusive nature and sensory intensity of these flashbacks?",
            "options": ["Hypothalamus", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Sensory Cortex", "Thalamus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sensory cortex is responsible for processing sensory information.  During flashbacks, the sensory cortex can reactivate as if the traumatic event is happening in the present, leading to vivid and intense sensory experiences."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a core diagnostic criterion for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) according to the DSM-5?",
            "options": ["Persistent depressive mood", "Recurrent panic attacks", "Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence", "Significant weight loss or gain"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence is a core criterion for PTSD. The DSM-5 specifies that the individual must have directly experienced, witnessed, learned about, or been exposed to aversive details of a traumatic event."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client with a history of childhood trauma consistently engages in self-harm behaviors as a way to cope with intense emotional pain. This coping mechanism is BEST described as:",
            "options": ["Adaptive Coping", "Problem-Focused Coping", "Maladaptive Coping", "Emotion-Focused Coping"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maladaptive coping mechanisms, while providing temporary relief, ultimately exacerbate the problem or create new problems. Self-harm, although providing a momentary release of emotional pain, falls into this category due to its detrimental long-term consequences."

            "options": ["Abstract Reasoning", "Executive Functioning", "Spatial Awareness", "Verbal Fluency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex trauma, particularly early childhood trauma, can significantly impact the development of executive functioning skills, including planning, organization, impulse control, and emotional regulation.  Studies demonstrate a correlation between adverse childhood experiences and deficits in these areas."

            "id": "q2_10",

            "options": ["Immediately challenge the client's negative thoughts.", "Encourage the client to continue detailing the event to process the trauma.", "Ground the client and help them regulate their emotions.", "Analyze the client's defense mechanisms."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing safety and emotional regulation is paramount when a client becomes distressed. Grounding techniques help bring the client back to the present moment and regain a sense of control, creating a more stable foundation for processing the trauma."
