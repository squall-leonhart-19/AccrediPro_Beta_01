            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which advanced reframing technique is MOST suitable for addressing a client's belief that they are inherently flawed and unworthy of love?",
            "options": ["Socratic questioning", "Cognitive restructuring", "Positive data log", "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) reframing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring directly challenges and modifies maladaptive beliefs. Socratic questioning helps explore the belief, but cognitive restructuring actively works to change it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client with complex trauma reports experiencing intense emotional flashbacks triggered by specific sensory stimuli. Beyond basic grounding techniques, what is the NEXT most appropriate intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescribing an anxiolytic medication", "Implementing Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills training, focusing on distress tolerance", "Encouraging avoidance of triggering stimuli", "Referring for immediate hospitalization"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DBT skills training, especially distress tolerance, provides concrete strategies for managing intense emotional reactions in the moment. While medication might be considered later, and avoidance is not a long-term solution, DBT offers immediate coping mechanisms."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to research on self-compassion, what is the PRIMARY distinction between self-compassion and self-esteem?",
            "options": ["Self-compassion is contingent on external validation, while self-esteem is internally derived.", "Self-esteem involves evaluating oneself positively, while self-compassion involves treating oneself with kindness, especially during difficult times.", "Self-compassion is only effective for individuals with low self-esteem.", "Self-esteem is a more effective predictor of psychological well-being than self-compassion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-compassion focuses on kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness, particularly during suffering, while self-esteem is based on self-evaluation and comparison to others. Research indicates that self-compassion is a more stable predictor of well-being."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is the BEST example of nurturing a protective factor to build resilience in a client with a history of childhood trauma?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to suppress negative emotions.", "Facilitating the client's connection with a supportive community or group.", "Advising the client to avoid any reminders of their traumatic experiences.", "Promoting complete independence and self-reliance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Social support is a well-established protective factor that buffers against the negative effects of trauma. Connecting with a supportive community fosters a sense of belonging and reduces isolation."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In treatment planning for complex trauma, what is the MOST important initial step before addressing trauma-specific memories?",
            "options": ["Immediately processing the most distressing traumatic event.", "Establishing safety and stabilization.", "Implementing exposure therapy.", "Focusing solely on cognitive restructuring of negative beliefs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and stabilization is paramount in complex trauma treatment. Clients need to develop coping skills, emotional regulation, and a sense of safety before engaging in trauma-specific work. Premature exposure can be retraumatizing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A trauma therapist begins to experience intrusive thoughts and nightmares related to a client's traumatic experiences. What is the MOST appropriate initial self-care strategy?",
            "options": ["Increasing caseload to distract from the symptoms.", "Ignoring the symptoms and hoping they will resolve on their own.", "Engaging in peer supervision or consultation to process the vicarious trauma.", "Avoiding any further work with trauma survivors."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Peer supervision or consultation provides a safe space to process the emotional impact of vicarious trauma and develop coping strategies. Ignoring the symptoms can lead to burnout, and avoiding trauma work is not always feasible or desirable."

        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which ethical principle is MOST directly violated when a therapist initiates a romantic relationship with a former client, even after the termination of therapy?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Justice"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-maleficence, or 'do no harm,' is violated because the power differential that existed during therapy can continue to influence the former client, making it difficult for them to freely consent to a relationship. Such relationships are often exploitative."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "In the HEART framework for case conceptualization, what does the 'E' represent?",
            "options": ["Environment", "Empowerment", "Emotional Regulation", "External Resources"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the HEART framework, 'E' stands for Emotional Regulation, emphasizing the importance of assessing and addressing the client's ability to manage their emotions effectively."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A 35-year-old client, Sarah, presents with symptoms of PTSD following a car accident. Using the HEART framework, you identify that Sarah has difficulty identifying and expressing her emotions (H), struggles with grounding techniques during flashbacks (E), frequently blames herself for the accident (A), lacks close social connections (R), and has limited access to financial resources (T). According to the HEART framework, which area should be prioritized in the initial stages of treatment?",
            "options": ["Addressing Sarah's financial limitations (T)", "Improving Sarah's ability to identify and express emotions (H)", "Enhancing Sarah's access to social support (R)", "Improving Sarah's grounding techniques during flashbacks (E)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all areas are important, addressing Sarah's ability to regulate her emotions during flashbacks (E) is crucial for immediate stabilization and safety. This will provide her with the necessary tools to manage her symptoms and engage more effectively in other aspects of treatment."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "What is a key difference between traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)?",
            "options": ["TF-CBT does not address cognitive distortions.", "CBT focuses on past events, while TF-CBT focuses on present-day challenges.", "TF-CBT includes a trauma narrative component, while traditional CBT does not.", "CBT is specifically designed for children and adolescents, while TF-CBT is for adults."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TF-CBT incorporates a trauma narrative, allowing the client to process the traumatic event in a safe and structured manner. This component is generally absent in traditional CBT, which focuses more broadly on cognitive and behavioral patterns."
