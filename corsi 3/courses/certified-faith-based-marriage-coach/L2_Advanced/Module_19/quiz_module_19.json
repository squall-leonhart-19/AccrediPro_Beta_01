            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to research on marital commitment, what is a key predictor of long-term relationship success?",
            "options": ["Shared leisure activities", "Financial stability", "Perceived partner responsiveness", "Physical attractiveness"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently demonstrates that perceived partner responsiveness, the feeling that one's partner understands and cares for their needs, is a strong predictor of marital satisfaction and longevity. This aligns with the 'Commitment' aspect of the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. framework."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which research methodology is BEST suited for exploring the lived experiences of couples navigating infertility within a specific faith tradition?",
            "options": ["Randomized controlled trial", "Meta-analysis", "Qualitative phenomenological study", "Correlational study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A qualitative phenomenological study focuses on understanding the essence of a lived experience through in-depth interviews and analysis of participants' narratives. This approach is ideal for exploring complex and subjective experiences like infertility within a faith-based context."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of studies on empathy in marriage revealed what key finding?",
            "options": ["Empathy is more important for men than women.", "Empathy is negatively correlated with conflict resolution skills.", "Higher levels of empathy are associated with increased marital satisfaction and stability.", "Empathy has no significant impact on marital outcomes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show a positive correlation between empathy and marital satisfaction. Couples who demonstrate higher levels of empathy tend to have more stable and fulfilling relationships. This emphasizes the importance of 'Empathy' in the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. framework."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the 'C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T.' framework, the 'Observation' component encourages coaches to:",
            "options": ["Rely solely on the couple's self-report.", "Utilize validated assessment tools to gain objective data.", "Avoid any form of assessment to prevent bias.", "Focus only on past behaviors, ignoring current interactions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Observation' component stresses the importance of using objective data gathered through validated assessment tools and behavioral observations. This helps coaches gain a more comprehensive understanding of the couple's dynamics beyond their subjective reports."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Research on forgiveness in marriage has demonstrated that:",
            "options": ["Forgiveness is always beneficial, regardless of the offense.", "Forgiveness is only necessary in cases of infidelity.", "Self-compassion is a key predictor of the ability to grant forgiveness.", "Forgiveness leads to increased relationship satisfaction only when the offender consistently avoids taking accountability."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that self-compassion, the ability to treat oneself with kindness and understanding, is strongly linked to the capacity to forgive a partner. This aligns with the 'New Beginnings' and 'Trust' aspects of the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. framework."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A client reports that their spouse frequently criticizes their parenting style. Which research-backed communication technique would be MOST effective in addressing this issue?",
            "options": ["Using 'you' statements to express feelings.", "Employing active listening and 'I' statements to communicate needs and concerns.", "Avoiding direct confrontation to maintain peace.", "Focusing on the spouse's flaws to highlight the imbalance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active listening and 'I' statements promote clear, non-blaming communication, fostering understanding and reducing defensiveness. This approach is supported by research on effective communication in marriage and addresses the 'Nurture' component of the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T framework."

            "id": "q19_7",

            "options": ["Does religious attendance guarantee marital happiness?", "How do different faith traditions influence couples' conflict resolution strategies?", "Are secular marriages more successful than religious marriages?", "Should couples prioritize religious beliefs over personal desires?"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A culturally sensitive research question acknowledges the diversity of faith traditions and explores how these traditions shape couples' experiences. The other options are biased or make generalizations."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research consistently demonstrates a positive association between shared spiritual practices and marital satisfaction and meaning. These practices can strengthen a couple's bond and provide a shared sense of purpose. This directly relates to multiple aspects of the C.O.V.E.N.A.N.T. framework, including Values, Nurture, and New Beginnings."

            "question": "When integrating research into coaching practice, it's crucial to remember that research findings:",
            "options": ["Provide definitive answers to all marital problems.", "Should be applied rigidly without considering individual circumstances.", "Offer valuable insights but should be interpreted within the context of each couple's unique situation.", "Are irrelevant in faith-based coaching."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research provides valuable insights, but it's essential to apply them thoughtfully and adapt them to the specific needs and circumstances of each couple. A one-size-fits-all approach is rarely effective in marriage coaching."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practices enhance credibility, improve client outcomes, and demonstrate a commitment to professional standards. While faith-based coaching incorporates spiritual principles, it should also be informed by empirical research."
