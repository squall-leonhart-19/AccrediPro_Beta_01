            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY purpose of using assessment tools in faith-based marriage coaching?",
            "options": ["To diagnose psychological disorders in couples.", "To quickly resolve marital conflicts.", "To provide a structured framework for understanding relationship dynamics and tailoring coaching interventions.", "To replace traditional counseling methods."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessment tools help coaches understand the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship, enabling them to create personalized coaching plans. They are not meant to diagnose or replace counseling."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A couple scores low on the ENRICH assessment's 'Personality Issues' scale. What is the MOST appropriate initial coaching intervention?",
            "options": ["Recommend individual therapy for each partner.", "Address the specific personality differences identified in the assessment through communication and conflict resolution exercises.", "Immediately suggest a separation period.", "Ignore the results, as personality is fixed."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing personality issues involves helping the couple understand and navigate their differences. Individual therapy might be considered later if the issue is severe. Ignoring the results or suggesting separation without intervention is inappropriate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",

            "correctAnswer": 0,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Targeted exercises and feedback are essential to improve specific skill deficits identified by the assessment. While a workshop could be helpful, it's more effective when integrated into the coaching process."

            "options": ["Shared activities and quality time", "Emotional responsiveness and empathy", "Financial stability and income level", "Physical affection and sexual intimacy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
