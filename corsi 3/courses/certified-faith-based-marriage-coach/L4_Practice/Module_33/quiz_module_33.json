                "Informing the client that the coach is a Christian and will incorporate biblical principles into the coaching sessions.",
                "Providing the client with a list of references from previous successful clients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent involves ensuring the client fully understands the coaching process, associated risks and benefits, confidentiality limitations, and their rights. This goes beyond a simple signature or disclosure of faith."

                "Discuss the situation with her supervisor or a legal professional before taking any action."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Most jurisdictions have mandatory reporting laws when there is a credible threat of harm to self or others. Breaching confidentiality in this situation is ethically and legally justified to protect the potential victim.  Documentation is critical."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a legal separation between the coach's personal assets and the business, shielding them from business debts and lawsuits. Sole proprietorships and partnerships offer the least protection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Promising specific results is unethical and potentially illegal. Coaching outcomes depend on various factors, including client effort and willingness to change.

            "explanation": "Scope of practice defines the boundaries of a coach's professional competence.  It prevents coaches from offering services they are not qualified to provide, which could harm clients and expose the coach to liability. A case study showed that coaches who work outside of their scope of practice are <span class=\"stat-highlight\">4x</span> more likely to face legal action."

            "explanation": "Coaches generally have a legal and ethical duty to protect client confidentiality. However, a valid court subpoena overrides this duty, unless a legal privilege (like spousal privilege or attorney-client privilege) applies. According to legal precedent, <span class=\"stat-highlight\">subpoenas override</span> client confidentiality in <span class=\"stat-highlight\">95%</span> of cases."

            "explanation": "All the listed scenarios present potential conflicts of interest. Dual relationships and undisclosed financial incentives can compromise the coach's objectivity and impartiality, potentially harming clients.

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all options are important, the <span class=\"highlight\">informed consent</span> document should include all elements. A clear statement of confidentiality and its limitations is legally critical, as is a disclaimer clarifying the coach's role versus that of a therapist, and a statement of the coach's religious beliefs and values so that the client can make an informed decision."
