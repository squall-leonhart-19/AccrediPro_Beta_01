            "question": "In advanced pulse diagnosis, a 'confined' pulse primarily indicates:",
            "options": ["Excess heat", "Qi deficiency", "Blood stagnation", "Yin deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'confined' pulse, felt deep and narrow, often correlates with blood stagnation, hindering the free flow of Qi and Blood."

            "question": "Which tongue feature is MOST indicative of a Phlegm-Heat accumulation in the Lungs?",
            "options": ["A pale tongue with teeth marks", "A red tongue with a thick, yellow coating", "A thin, dry tongue with cracks", "A purple tongue with瘀斑 (ecchymoses)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A red tongue body with a thick, yellow coating is a hallmark sign of heat, combined with the thick coating indicating the presence of Phlegm."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "You are treating a patient with Liver Qi stagnation presenting with irritability, hypochondriac pain, and irregular menstruation. Which herbal modification would be MOST appropriate to add to Xiao Yao San (Rambling Powder)?",
            "options": ["Adding Huang Lian (Coptis chinensis) to clear heat", "Adding Chuan Xiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong) to move Qi and Blood", "Adding Fu Ling (Poria cocos) to strengthen Spleen Qi", "Adding Gan Jiang (Zingiber officinale) to warm the Middle Jiao"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chuan Xiong strongly moves Qi and Blood, directly addressing the stagnation that is causing the patient's symptoms. Xiao Yao San already addresses Spleen Qi deficiency and Liver Qi stagnation, but sometimes needs a stronger Qi-moving herb."

            "question": "In a patient presenting with both Kidney Yin and Yang deficiency, which acupuncture point combination would be MOST effective?",
            "options": ["SP 6 (Sanyinjiao) and LV 3 (Taichong)", "LI 4 (Hegu) and ST 36 (Zusanli)", "KI 3 (Taixi) and DU 4 (Mingmen)", "LU 7 (Lieque) and KI 6 (Zhaohai)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "KI 3 tonifies Kidney Yin, while DU 4 tonifies Kidney Yang, addressing both aspects of the deficiency. The other options primarily address Qi stagnation or Qi/Blood deficiency."

            "question": "A patient with Damp-Heat in the Spleen is advised to limit which food category MOST significantly?",
            "options": ["Leafy green vegetables", "Spicy foods", "Dairy products", "Root vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dairy products are considered damp-producing and can exacerbate Damp-Heat conditions in the Spleen. While spicy foods generate heat, dairy contributes directly to dampness."

            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, presents with chronic fatigue, digestive issues, and anxiety. After several sessions, she reveals she is struggling with a difficult relationship with her mother. What ethical consideration is MOST important to address?",
            "options": ["Immediately confronting the mother about her behavior", "Referring Sarah to a psychotherapist specializing in family dynamics", "Integrating herbal formulas to directly address the emotional stagnation", "Ignoring the emotional aspect and focusing solely on the physical symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recognizing the limits of your expertise and referring the client to a qualified psychotherapist is crucial. While TCM can address emotional imbalances, deeper psychological issues require specialized care. This ensures you are practicing within your scope of practice and providing the best possible care for the client."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of studies on acupuncture for chronic pain (n=1200) showed a statistically significant reduction in pain scores (p < 0.01) compared to standard care. How should a TCM practitioner integrate this evidence into their practice?",
            "options": ["Immediately adopting acupuncture as the primary treatment for all chronic pain patients", "Dismissing the evidence due to potential bias in acupuncture research", "Considering the evidence alongside clinical experience and patient preferences when developing a treatment plan", "Ignoring the meta-analysis and relying solely on traditional TCM theory"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Evidence-informed practice involves integrating research findings with clinical experience and patient values. The meta-analysis provides support for acupuncture's efficacy, but it should not be the sole basis for treatment decisions."

            "options": ["Severe headaches", "Palpitations and insomnia", "Lower back pain", "Frequent urination"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Blood deficiency manifests most commonly as palpitations, anxiety, and insomnia due to the Heart's role in housing the Shen (spirit). Liver Blood deficiency can contribute to these symptoms, making palpitations and insomnia the most likely presenting symptoms."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "Client John, 60, presents with fatigue, shortness of breath, and a weak, thready pulse. He has a history of smoking and a family history of lung disease. You suspect Lung Qi deficiency. Which dietary recommendation would be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the consumption of large amounts of raw vegetables", "Recommending a diet rich in pungent spices to invigorate Lung Qi", "Suggesting easily digestible, cooked foods with Lung-tonifying properties like pears and almonds", "Advising a high-protein diet to build strength"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Easily digestible foods support Spleen Qi, which is essential for generating Lung Qi. Cooked foods are easier to digest. Pears and almonds are known to moisten the Lungs and tonify Lung Qi. Raw vegetables can be difficult to digest, and pungent spices, while sometimes beneficial, can be too drying for a Lung Qi deficient patient."
