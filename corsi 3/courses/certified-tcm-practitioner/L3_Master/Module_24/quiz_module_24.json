            "question": "Which of the following pulse qualities, beyond the basic 28, would MOST strongly indicate a severe deficiency of Yin and Blood, potentially leading to internal wind?",
            "options": ["Choppy and Wiry", "Fine and Rapid", "Slippery and Taut", "Hollow and Deep"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Fine and Rapid pulse, especially when combined with other signs, indicates extreme deficiency of Yin and Blood, generating heat and potentially leading to internal wind. The case study of Mrs. Chen, detailed in L1, illustrated this pattern."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "In complex pattern differentiation, what is the PRIMARY benefit of using the 'Four Levels' (Wei, Qi, Ying, Blood) in addition to the Eight Principles?",
            "options": ["Simplifies diagnosis for beginners", "Provides a more superficial understanding of the disease", "Offers a framework for understanding the progression and depth of pathogenic invasion", "Replaces the need for tongue diagnosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Four Levels provide a framework to understand the depth and progression of a pathogenic invasion. This allows for more nuanced treatment strategies. It does not replace the Eight Principles or tongue diagnosis."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "When performing deep needling techniques, what is the MOST important factor to consider to prevent adverse effects?",
            "options": ["Using the thickest gauge needle available", "Ignoring patient feedback to maintain momentum", "Having a thorough understanding of anatomy and point location", "Always using strong stimulation techniques"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thorough understanding of anatomy and accurate point location are crucial for safe and effective deep needling. This minimizes the risk of puncturing vital organs or nerves. As emphasized in L3, safety is paramount."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "You have a patient with Liver Qi Stagnation presenting with irritability, hypochondriac pain, and a wiry pulse. The standard Xiao Yao San formula is not fully resolving their symptoms. Which modification would be MOST appropriate if the patient also reports significant digestive bloating and loose stools?",
            "options": ["Add Chai Hu (Bupleurum) to strongly dredge Liver Qi", "Remove Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis) to reduce blood tonification", "Add Chen Pi (Citrus peel) and Fu Ling (Poria) to address Spleen Qi deficiency and dampness", "Increase the dosage of Bai Shao (White Peony) to nourish Liver Blood"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The patient's digestive issues suggest Spleen Qi deficiency and dampness. Adding Chen Pi and Fu Ling will address these symptoms and improve the overall effectiveness of the formula. The case study of Mr. Li (L4) provides a similar example."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "A patient with Kidney Yin Deficiency presents with night sweats, lower back pain, and a dry mouth. Which dietary recommendation would be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["A diet high in spicy and warming foods", "Limiting fluid intake to reduce night sweats", "Incorporating foods that nourish Kidney Yin, such as black beans, seaweed, and pears", "Following a strict ketogenic diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Foods that nourish Kidney Yin are appropriate for this pattern. Spicy and warming foods would exacerbate the Yin deficiency. Limiting fluids is generally contraindicated in cases of dryness. Ketogenic diets are not traditionally used in TCM for this pattern."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Which lifestyle recommendation is MOST crucial for a patient diagnosed with Heart Blood Deficiency and experiencing anxiety and insomnia?",
            "options": ["Vigorous exercise in the evening to promote sleep", "Minimizing social interaction to reduce stress", "Regular mindfulness practices such as meditation or Tai Chi", "Drinking caffeinated beverages throughout the day to combat fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness practices help calm the mind and nourish the Heart. Vigorous exercise in the evening can disrupt sleep. Minimizing social interaction may worsen feelings of isolation. Caffeinated beverages exacerbate anxiety and insomnia."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "A patient discloses that they are seeing multiple TCM practitioners concurrently and receiving conflicting treatments. What is the MOST ETHICAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately refuse to treat the patient to avoid liability", "Continue treatment without acknowledging the other practitioners", "Encourage the patient to choose one practitioner to ensure consistent and coordinated care", "Contact the other practitioners to coordinate treatment plans without the patient's consent"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Encouraging the patient to choose one practitioner promotes coordinated care and avoids potential conflicts or adverse interactions between treatments. It respects the patient's autonomy and ensures the best possible outcome. Maintaining patient confidentiality is paramount."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "According to industry data presented in L8, what is the APPROXIMATE average annual revenue increase experienced by TCM clinics that implement effective online marketing strategies, compared to those that rely solely on word-of-mouth?",
            "options": ["5%", "15%", "30%", "50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q24_9",
            "question": "A patient presents with a complex case involving both Liver Qi Stagnation and Spleen Qi Deficiency. Which of the following acupuncture point combinations would be MOST appropriate, considering both distal and local points?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LV-3 and GB-34 address Liver Qi Stagnation, while PC-6 regulates Qi flow and calms the Shen, indirectly supporting Spleen function. LI-4, ST-36, SP-6 is more geared towards general Qi tonification, while LV-14, SP-21, CV-12 focuses heavily on local points and UB-18, UB-20, GB-20 targets the back shu points and wind respectively."
        },
        {
            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "You are treating a patient with a history of trauma who experiences emotional flashbacks during acupuncture sessions. What is the MOST appropriate modification to your treatment approach?",
            "options": ["Using stronger stimulation techniques to break through the emotional block", "Avoiding any discussion of the patient's trauma to prevent triggering flashbacks", "Creating a safe and supportive environment, using gentle needling techniques, and grounding techniques", "Referring the patient to a psychiatrist and discontinuing TCM treatment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating a safe and supportive environment, using gentle needling, and incorporating grounding techniques are crucial for patients with a history of trauma. Strong stimulation can be re-traumatizing. Avoiding discussion entirely may invalidate the patient's experience. While referral to a psychiatrist may be beneficial, it doesn't necessarily mean discontinuing TCM treatment."
