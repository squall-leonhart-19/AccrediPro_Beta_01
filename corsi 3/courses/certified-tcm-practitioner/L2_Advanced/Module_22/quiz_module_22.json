            "question": "A TCM practitioner discovers that a new patient is also seeing another TCM practitioner for the same condition. Ethically, what is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately refuse to treat the patient to avoid conflicting treatments.", "Discuss the situation openly with the patient, explaining the importance of coordinated care and obtaining consent to communicate with the other practitioner.", "Continue treatment as normal, but closely monitor the patient for any adverse reactions.", "Contact the other TCM practitioner directly to discuss the patient's case without the patient's consent."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Open communication with the patient, respecting their autonomy and ensuring coordinated care, is the most ethical approach. Direct communication with the other practitioner without consent violates patient confidentiality."
