            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step when synthesizing diagnostic information to formulate a TCM treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Selecting the primary acupuncture points.", "Identifying the root cause of the disharmony according to TCM patterns.", "Prescribing a patent herbal formula.", "Recommending dietary changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying the root cause, according to TCM pattern differentiation, is the foundation upon which all other treatment strategies are built. This ensures the treatment addresses the underlying imbalance, not just the symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A 55-year-old female client presents with chronic fatigue, dizziness, and a pale complexion. Her tongue is pale and swollen with teeth marks, and her pulse is weak. According to TCM pattern differentiation, which of the following acupuncture point combinations would be MOST appropriate to address the root cause?",
            "options": ["LI-4, ST-36, SP-6", "LV-3, GB-34, BL-18", "HT-7, PC-6, SP-4", "KI-3, BL-23, DU-4"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The symptoms suggest Qi and Blood deficiency. LI-4 (Large Intestine 4) promotes the movement of Qi, ST-36 (Stomach 36) tonifies Qi and Blood, and SP-6 (Spleen 6) nourishes Blood and strengthens the Spleen, which is crucial for Qi and Blood production."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In advanced acupuncture point selection, what is the significance of utilizing 'local' points in conjunction with 'distal' points?",
            "options": ["Local points are only for symptomatic relief, while distal points address the root cause.", "Local points stimulate Qi flow directly at the affected area, while distal points regulate the Zang-Fu organs and meridians.", "Local points are stronger and should always be needled first.", "Distal points are contraindicated for acute conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Local points provide direct stimulation and pain relief, while distal points influence the overall energy balance and treat the underlying causes of the condition as related to the Zang-Fu and meridian systems. This combination offers a more comprehensive treatment."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client presents with Liver Qi stagnation causing irritability and rib-side pain. You initially prescribe Xiao Yao San. After two weeks, the irritability has improved, but the rib-side pain persists. What is the MOST appropriate herbal formula modification?",
            "options": ["Add Huang Lian (Coptis Rhizome) to clear heat.", "Increase the dosage of Chai Hu (Bupleurum Radix) to further soothe Liver Qi.", "Add Yan Hu Suo (Corydalis Rhizoma) and Chuan Lian Zi (Meliae Toosendan Fructus) to move Qi and alleviate pain.", "Switch to Si Ni San to warm the extremities."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Yan Hu Suo and Chuan Lian Zi are specifically used to alleviate pain associated with Qi stagnation. Increasing Chai Hu might be helpful, but directly addressing the pain is more effective in this situation. Huang Lian and Si Ni San are not indicated based on the presenting symptoms."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which dietary recommendation is MOST suitable for a client diagnosed with Damp-Heat in the Spleen?",
            "options": ["Encourage a diet rich in raw vegetables and fruits.", "Recommend the consumption of dairy products to strengthen the Spleen.", "Advise avoiding greasy, fried foods and sugary drinks while emphasizing easily digestible, cooked grains.", "Suggest increasing fluid intake to flush out the dampness."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Damp-Heat is exacerbated by greasy, fried foods and sugary drinks. Easily digestible cooked grains support Spleen function without generating more dampness. Raw foods can burden the Spleen, and dairy can contribute to dampness. Excessive fluids can also worsen dampness."

            "question": "A 68-year-old client with Kidney Yin deficiency is undergoing acupuncture and herbal treatment. What lifestyle recommendation is MOST crucial to support their treatment and overall well-being?",
            "options": ["Engaging in high-intensity exercise daily to boost energy.", "Maintaining a regular sleep schedule and avoiding overwork to conserve Yin.", "Consuming large amounts of spicy foods to stimulate Yang.", "Practicing intermittent fasting to improve digestion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Kidney Yin deficiency requires conserving Yin essence. Regular sleep and avoiding overwork are essential. High-intensity exercise can deplete Yin, spicy foods can generate heat, and intermittent fasting may not be appropriate for someone with deficiency."

            "question": "According to a 2022 study published in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine*, what is the reported average percentage of patients experiencing minor adverse effects (e.g., mild bruising, soreness) following acupuncture treatment?",
            "options": ["Less than 1%", "Around 10-15%", "Approximately 25-30%", "Over 50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that acupuncture is generally safe, with minor adverse effects reported in approximately 10-15% of patients. Serious adverse events are rare."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A client with chronic pain expresses unrealistic expectations about the speed of recovery with TCM treatment. What is the MOST appropriate approach to manage their expectations?",
            "options": ["Guarantee a complete recovery within a specific timeframe to maintain their confidence.", "Avoid discussing the prognosis to prevent discouragement.", "Provide a realistic explanation of the treatment process, potential outcomes, and the importance of their active participation.", "Emphasize only the positive aspects of the treatment to avoid creating doubt."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Honest and realistic communication is crucial. Clients need to understand the process, potential outcomes, and their role in the healing process. This builds trust and promotes adherence to the treatment plan."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "In treating geriatric patients, what is a crucial consideration when selecting acupuncture points?",
            "options": ["Using stronger stimulation techniques to overcome age-related Qi deficiency.", "Avoiding distal points to minimize travel time for frail patients.", "Using fewer needles and gentler stimulation due to potential Qi and Blood deficiency and increased sensitivity.", "Exclusively using local points for direct pain relief."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Geriatric patients often have weakened Qi and Blood and may be more sensitive to stimulation. Using fewer needles and gentler techniques is essential to avoid overwhelming their system."

            "options": ["SP-6 (Spleen 6)", "ST-36 (Stomach 36)", "PC-6 (Pericardium 6)", "LI-4 (Large Intestine 4)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "LI-4 (Large Intestine 4) is traditionally contraindicated during pregnancy due to its potential to induce labor. While some practitioners may use it cautiously under specific circumstances, it's generally avoided."
