            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "In advanced tongue diagnosis, what does a deep red tongue body, particularly at the tip, often indicate?",
            "options": ["Deficiency of Spleen Qi", "Excess Heat in the Heart", "Kidney Yin Deficiency", "Damp Heat in the Liver"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A deep red tongue, especially at the tip, is a classic sign of Excess Heat in the Heart, often associated with emotional distress or insomnia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "During pulse diagnosis, a wiry pulse is most indicative of which condition?",
            "options": ["Blood Deficiency", "Qi Deficiency", "Liver Qi Stagnation", "Kidney Yin Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A wiry pulse, felt as tense and straight like a guitar string, is strongly associated with Liver Qi Stagnation, often related to stress or emotional constraint. It reflects the constrained flow of Qi."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When palpating the Large Intestine channel, tenderness upon pressure at the point ST25 (Tianshu) often indicates:",
            "options": ["Spleen Qi Deficiency", "Large Intestine Damp-Heat", "Kidney Yang Deficiency", "Heart Blood Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ST25 (Tianshu) is located near the Large Intestine, and tenderness upon palpation often points to imbalances within the Large Intestine itself, such as Damp-Heat leading to inflammation or digestive issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A patient reports feeling 'heavy' and 'sluggish,' especially in their limbs. Which of the Six External Evils is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Wind", "Cold", "Summer Heat", "Dampness"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Dampness is characterized by heaviness, stickiness, and a sense of being weighed down. It often manifests as sluggishness, edema, and digestive issues."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which standardized questionnaire is MOST appropriate for assessing anxiety symptoms in a TCM context?",
            "options": ["SF-36 Health Survey", "Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale", "Beck Depression Inventory", "The WHO Quality of Life Scale"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale is designed specifically to quantify anxiety levels and is therefore the most directly relevant tool for assessing anxiety in TCM practice."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A patient presents with fatigue, a pale tongue, and a fine, weak pulse. Another patient presents with fatigue, irritability, and a wiry pulse. What is the PRIMARY differential diagnosis to consider?",
            "options": ["Both have Spleen Qi Deficiency", "One has Blood Deficiency, the other has Liver Qi Stagnation", "Both have Liver Qi Stagnation", "One has Kidney Yin Deficiency, the other has Heart Blood Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The first patient's symptoms (pale tongue, weak pulse) suggest Blood Deficiency. The second patient's symptoms (irritability, wiry pulse) suggest Liver Qi Stagnation. Differential diagnosis is crucial for accurate pattern identification."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Integrating biomedical assessment, a patient presents with lower back pain and reports elevated levels of inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP) on a recent blood test. What TCM pattern is MOST likely associated with these findings?",
            "options": ["Kidney Yin Deficiency", "Kidney Yang Deficiency", "Blood Stasis", "Liver Blood Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated inflammatory markers indicate inflammation, which in TCM is often associated with Blood Stasis, obstructing the flow of Qi and Blood and leading to pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "In documentation, what is the MOST important reason for including both subjective and objective findings?",
            "options": ["To impress other practitioners", "To create a more detailed invoice", "To provide a comprehensive and defensible record of the patient's condition and treatment plan", "To fulfill insurance requirements only"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive documentation including both subjective patient reports and objective clinical findings is crucial for creating a clear, auditable, and defensible record of the patient's case, supporting clinical decision-making and ensuring continuity of care. It is essential for legal and ethical considerations."

            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, complains of headaches, irritability, and premenstrual tension. Her tongue is slightly red on the sides, and her pulse is wiry. What is the MOST likely TCM pattern?",
            "options": ["Kidney Yin Deficiency", "Liver Qi Stagnation", "Heart Blood Deficiency", "Spleen Qi Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of headaches, irritability, premenstrual tension, a slightly red tongue on the sides, and a wiry pulse strongly indicates Liver Qi Stagnation, a common pattern in women experiencing hormonal imbalances."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A 2023 study showed that practitioners who consistently use standardized questionnaires report a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30%</span> improvement in diagnostic accuracy. What is the PRIMARY reason for this increased accuracy?",
            "options": ["The questionnaires replace the need for pulse diagnosis", "The questionnaires provide a structured and objective way to gather information, reducing bias", "The questionnaires are easier to administer than tongue diagnosis", "The questionnaires guarantee a correct diagnosis every time"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized questionnaires provide a structured and objective method for gathering patient information, minimizing subjective bias and allowing practitioners to identify patterns and symptoms more accurately. This leads to improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning."
