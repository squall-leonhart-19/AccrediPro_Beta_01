            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In TCM, emotions are considered a major cause of disease because they directly affect the Zang-Fu organs. Prolonged or intense emotions can disrupt the flow of Qi and Blood, leading to imbalances and illness. This contrasts with the idea that emotions are irrelevant or solely related to genetics."
