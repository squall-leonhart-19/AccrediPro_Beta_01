            "question": "Which of the following is NOT considered one of the Four Pillars of TCM diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Observation", "Palpation", "Questioning", "Auscultation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Four Pillars are Observation, Questioning, Palpation, and Olfaction. Auscultation, while used in Western medicine, is not traditionally one of the Four Pillars in TCM."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A patient presents with a pale complexion, fatigue, and shortness of breath. According to TCM principles, which Qi deficiency is MOST likely indicated?",
            "options": ["Lung Qi Deficiency", "Spleen Qi Deficiency", "Kidney Qi Deficiency", "Heart Qi Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Pale complexion and shortness of breath strongly suggest Lung Qi deficiency, as the Lungs govern respiration and influence the color of the skin."

            "question": "During pulse diagnosis, a 'wiry' pulse is MOST indicative of which condition?",
            "options": ["Blood Deficiency", "Qi Deficiency", "Liver Qi Stagnation", "Phlegm Accumulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A wiry pulse, felt as tense and string-like, is a classic sign of Liver Qi Stagnation, indicating constrained and inflexible Qi flow."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "On tongue diagnosis, a red tongue tip MOST often corresponds to imbalances in which organ?",
            "options": ["Spleen", "Kidney", "Heart", "Liver"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The tongue tip reflects the Heart, so redness in this area often indicates Heart Fire or other Heart-related imbalances."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "According to the case study presented in Lesson 8, a 45-year-old woman named Mei experienced chronic fatigue and digestive issues. Which Qi deficiency pattern was MOST likely identified in her case?",
            "options": ["Lung Qi Deficiency", "Kidney Qi Deficiency", "Spleen Qi Deficiency", "Liver Qi Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted Mei's digestive issues and fatigue, which are hallmark symptoms of Spleen Qi Deficiency. The Spleen is responsible for transformation and transportation of nutrients."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "When questioning a patient, which of the following is the MOST important aspect to focus on to assess their Qi?",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "All of these factors contribute to the overall Qi assessment. Family history can reveal constitutional weaknesses, dietary habits directly impact Qi production, and emotional state strongly influences Qi flow."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A swollen tongue with a thick, greasy coating is a classic sign of Dampness. The swelling indicates fluid retention, and the greasy coating suggests impaired transformation and transportation of fluids."

            "question": "A patient reports feeling cold all the time, especially in their lower back and knees. They also experience frequent urination at night. Which organ system is MOST likely deficient in Qi?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feeling cold, especially in the lower back and knees, and frequent nighttime urination are characteristic symptoms of Kidney Yang Deficiency. The Kidneys govern the lower body and are responsible for warming and storing essence."

            "options": ["25%", "55%", "75%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2018 study by Chen et al. indicated that approximately 75% of experienced TCM practitioners could accurately identify Liver Qi Stagnation based solely on pulse diagnosis, highlighting the skill and experience required for accurate assessment."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The most crucial initial step is to identify the underlying pattern of disharmony. This involves integrating all the information gathered from the Four Pillars to understand the root cause of the patient's condition before formulating a treatment plan."
