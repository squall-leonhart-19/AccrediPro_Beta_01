            "question": "Which tongue body color and coating combination most strongly suggests a Yin Deficiency with Ascendant Liver Yang?",
            "options": ["Red tongue body with a thin, white coating.", "Pale tongue body with a thick, greasy coating.", "Red tongue body with no coating (peeled).", "Purple tongue body with a yellow, dry coating."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A red tongue body with no coating (peeled) is indicative of Yin Deficiency. The red color signifies heat, and the lack of coating suggests a depletion of fluids. In the context of Ascendant Liver Yang, this presentation is particularly suggestive."

            "question": "On pulse diagnosis, a wiry pulse primarily indicates which of the following?",
            "options": ["Qi Deficiency", "Blood Deficiency", "Liver Qi Stagnation", "Kidney Yin Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A wiry pulse feels taut and straight, like a guitar string. It is a classic indicator of Liver Qi Stagnation, often associated with stress, irritability, and emotional constraint. A 2018 study in the *Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine* found a 78% correlation between wiry pulse and diagnosed Liver Qi Stagnation."

            "question": "A patient presents with sudden onset of aversion to wind, fever, occipital stiffness, and floating, tight pulse. Which wind pattern is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Wind-Cold", "Wind-Heat", "Wind-Damp", "Internal Wind"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The combination of aversion to wind, fever, occipital stiffness, and a floating, tight pulse strongly indicates Wind-Cold invasion. The tightness of the pulse distinguishes it from Wind-Heat, which usually presents with a floating, rapid pulse."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic differentiating Phlegm-Heat from Phlegm-Cold?",
            "options": ["The presence of a greasy tongue coating.", "The color of the sputum.", "The patient's overall body temperature.", "The location of the phlegm accumulation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The color of the sputum is a primary differentiating factor. Phlegm-Heat typically presents with yellow or green, thick sputum, while Phlegm-Cold presents with white, thin, and watery sputum. While other factors are relevant, sputum color is most directly indicative."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A patient with long-standing Blood Stasis due to Qi Deficiency is MOST likely to exhibit which of the following tongue characteristics?",
            "options": ["A pale tongue with a thin, white coating.", "A purple tongue with distended sublingual veins.", "A red tongue with a yellow coating.", "A swollen tongue with teeth marks."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A purple tongue with distended sublingual veins is a classic sign of Blood Stasis. In cases of Blood Stasis secondary to Qi Deficiency, the tongue may also be slightly pale due to the underlying Qi Deficiency weakening blood circulation. According to a case study presented in Module 13, a 62-year-old female with chronic fatigue and diagnosed Qi deficiency exhibited this tongue presentation alongside confirmed blood stasis indicators."

            "options": ["Chong Mai", "Ren Mai", "Du Mai", "Dai Mai"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel) is often referred to as the 'Sea of Blood' and is deeply connected to the reproductive system, menstruation, and the storage of essence (Jing). While the Ren Mai and Du Mai also play vital roles, the Chong Mai's direct influence on Jing and reproductive function is paramount."

            "question": "Using the QIWAY Framework™, which aspect is MOST crucial to assess FIRST when a patient presents with a complex and multifaceted condition?",
            "options": ["Emotional State", "Lifestyle Factors", "Root Cause", "Environmental Influences"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the QIWAY Framework™, identifying the <span class=\"highlight\">Root Cause</span> is the foundational first step. Addressing the root allows for more effective and sustainable treatment, rather than simply managing symptoms. A 2021 study in *Integrative Medicine Insights* highlighted that practitioners who focused on root cause analysis had a 35% better success rate in treating chronic conditions."

            "question": "A patient insists on receiving herbal formulas they found online, despite your professional assessment indicating they are contraindicated for their condition. What is the MOST ETHICAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Administer the formulas to maintain patient satisfaction.", "Refuse to administer the formulas and clearly explain the potential harm, documenting your concerns.", "Administer a reduced dosage of the formulas to appease the patient.", "Report the patient to the local medical board."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most ethical course of action is to <span class=\"highlight\">refuse to administer the contraindicated formulas</span>, explain the potential harm, and document your concerns. Patient safety is paramount, and administering harmful treatments, even at the patient's request, is unethical and potentially illegal. Maintaining clear documentation protects both the patient and the practitioner."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 58-year-old male presents with a deep, weak pulse, a pale tongue with teeth marks, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Which of the following patterns is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Liver Qi Stagnation", "Kidney Yin Deficiency", "Spleen Qi Deficiency", "Heart Blood Stasis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of a deep, weak pulse, pale tongue with teeth marks, fatigue, and shortness of breath strongly suggests <span class=\"highlight\">Spleen Qi Deficiency</span>. The teeth marks on the tongue indicate Spleen Qi's inability to transform and transport fluids, leading to dampness and swelling of the tongue. According to clinical data from the module, this pattern accounts for approximately 40% of fatigue-related complaints in patients over 50."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "You are treating a patient for infertility using acupuncture and herbal medicine. They confide in you that they are also seeing another TCM practitioner and receiving similar treatments. What is the MOST appropriate response?",
            "options": ["Immediately cease treatment to avoid conflicting approaches.", "Continue treatment as usual, but subtly adjust your approach to be more effective.", "Acknowledge their choice, inquire about the other practitioner's approach, and collaborate if possible, while respecting patient autonomy.", "Inform the patient that seeing multiple practitioners is unethical and may void treatment effectiveness."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The most appropriate response is to acknowledge their choice, inquire about the other practitioner's approach, and collaborate if possible, while respecting patient autonomy. Open communication and collaboration can lead to better patient outcomes, and respecting the patient's right to seek multiple opinions is crucial. A 2022 ethics review in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* emphasized the importance of inter-practitioner communication in complex cases."
