            "question": "In advanced tongue diagnosis, a deep red tongue body, particularly on the tip, most likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Blood deficiency", "Yin deficiency with heat", "Heart heat", "Damp-heat in the Spleen"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A deep red tongue tip is highly indicative of Heart heat, often associated with emotional stress or underlying inflammation. Remember the tongue tip corresponds to the Heart region."

            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A choppy pulse (涩脉) is most closely associated with which of the following conditions?",
            "options": ["Blood deficiency or blood stagnation", "Yin deficiency", "Phlegm accumulation", "Qi stagnation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A choppy pulse, characterized by its uneven and hesitant nature, strongly suggests either blood deficiency (insufficient blood to smoothly fill the vessels) or blood stagnation (impeded blood flow). Think of it like trying to row a boat in choppy water."

            "id": "q6_3",

            "options": ["Exterior Heat", "Interior Cold", "Exterior Cold", "Interior Heat"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aversion to cold, preference for warmth, and a slow, weak pulse are hallmark signs of Interior Cold. The body is inherently deficient in Yang energy, leading to these symptoms."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is the most accurate description of the relationship between Qi and Blood?",
            "options": ["Blood is the mother of Qi", "Qi is the commander of Blood", "Blood and Qi are independent of each other", "Qi nourishes Blood, but Blood does not influence Qi"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Qi is considered the commander of Blood because it moves and transforms Blood. Without Qi, Blood would stagnate. Blood nourishes Qi, making both interdependent, but Qi's role in governing movement is paramount."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Earth controls Water in the Five Element theory. Think of a dam holding back a river; the earth contains and manages the flow of water."

            "options": ["Spleen", "Kidney", "Liver", "Heart"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypochondriac pain, irritability, and a wiry pulse are classic signs of Liver Qi stagnation. The Liver governs the smooth flow of Qi, and when this is disrupted, these symptoms manifest."

            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A patient reports palpitations, insomnia, and a thin, rapid pulse. Which of the following patterns is the most likely diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Heart Blood Deficiency", "Heart Yin Deficiency", "Heart Qi Deficiency", "Heart Yang Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Palpitations, insomnia, and a thin, rapid pulse are strong indicators of Heart Yin Deficiency. The Yin failing to anchor the Yang leads to these heat-related symptoms."

            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "A patient presents with fatigue, poor appetite, loose stools, and a pale tongue with a white coating. Which pattern is most likely?",

            "options": ["Liver Fire Blazing", "Liver Blood Deficiency", "Spleen Qi Deficiency", "Kidney Yin Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic headaches, blurred vision, and floaters, coupled with a pale, thin tongue, strongly suggest Liver Blood Deficiency. The Liver's role in nourishing the eyes is compromised in this scenario."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Heart (Fire element) and Small Intestine (Fire element) are internally-externally related and work together to separate pure from impure substances. The Heart governs Blood, and the Small Intestine further refines fluids."
