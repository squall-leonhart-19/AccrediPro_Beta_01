            "question": "In advanced tongue diagnosis, what does a deep red tongue body, especially in the heart region, often indicate?",
            "options": ["Deficiency of Qi", "Excess Heat in the Blood", "Damp-Phlegm accumulation", "Kidney Yin Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A deep red tongue, particularly in the heart region, suggests intense heat in the blood, often associated with emotional stress or febrile diseases. This is distinct from a pale tongue (Qi deficiency) or swollen tongue (Damp-Phlegm)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Which pulse position primarily reflects the state of the Spleen and Stomach?",
            "options": ["Left Cun", "Right Cun", "Left Guan", "Right Guan"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Right Guan position corresponds to the Spleen and Stomach. The Left Guan relates to the Liver and Gallbladder, while the Cun positions represent the Heart and Lungs (left and right respectively)."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A patient presents with fatigue, a pale complexion, shortness of breath, and a weak pulse. Which of the following TCM patterns is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Liver Qi Stagnation", "Spleen Qi Deficiency", "Kidney Yang Deficiency", "Heart Blood Stasis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fatigue, pale complexion, and shortness of breath are hallmark signs of Qi deficiency. While Liver Qi Stagnation can cause fatigue, the pale complexion and weak pulse point more strongly to Spleen Qi Deficiency."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "When modifying a classic herbal formula, what is the primary consideration when adding herbs that drain dampness?",
            "options": ["The patient's overall Qi strength", "The presence of Heat or Cold signs", "The location of the dampness (upper, middle, or lower Jiao)", "The patient's emotional state"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When addressing dampness, it's crucial to consider its location. Herbs that drain dampness act differently depending on whether the dampness is in the upper, middle, or lower Jiao. For example, herbs that strongly drain dampness from the lower Jiao might be too harsh for dampness in the upper Jiao."

            "question": "Which acupuncture point combination is MOST effective for treating Liver Yang Rising?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GB-20 (Feng Chi) and LV-2 (Xing Jian) are commonly used to address Liver Yang Rising. GB-20 helps to subdue wind and clear the head, while LV-2 drains Liver Fire and calms the Shen."

            "question": "According to advanced dietary therapy principles, what food property is MOST important to consider when treating a patient with Damp-Heat?",
            "options": ["Flavor (sweet, sour, etc.)", "Temperature (warming, cooling, neutral)", "Color (red, green, etc.)", "Texture (smooth, rough, etc.)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For Damp-Heat, the temperature of the food is crucial. Cooling foods are generally recommended to clear the heat, while foods that promote dampness (e.g., greasy, sweet foods) should be avoided."

            "question": "Client Ms. Chen, 52, presents with chronic fatigue, dizziness, and blurred vision. Her tongue is pale and thin, and her pulse is fine and weak. Based on QIWAY principles, which initial pattern differentiation is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Liver Qi Stagnation", "Heart Blood Deficiency", "Kidney Yin Deficiency", "Spleen Qi Deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pale, thin tongue and fine, weak pulse, along with fatigue, dizziness, and blurred vision, strongly suggest Heart Blood Deficiency. Dizziness and blurred vision are often linked to insufficient blood nourishing the head."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of a 'confined' pulse, often indicating blood stasis or phlegm accumulation?",
            "options": ["Floats easily on the surface", "Feels thready and weak", "Feels wiry and tense", "Feels tight and restrained, hitting the fingers with force"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A 'confined' or 'firm' pulse is deep, wiry, and forceful, suggesting that something is obstructing the free flow of Qi and Blood, such as blood stasis or phlegm accumulation. The force against the fingers is key to this pulse quality."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ST-36 (Zu San Li) strengthens the Spleen and Stomach and promotes digestion. PC-6 (Nei Guan) regulates Qi flow and alleviates nausea and vomiting, often associated with food stagnation. This combination addresses both the root and branch of the condition."
