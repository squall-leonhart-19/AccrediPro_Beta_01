            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client reports experiencing intense emotional release during a <span class=\"highlight\">Kriya Yoga</span> session. As a master practitioner, what is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and provide grounding techniques.", "Encourage the client to fully express the emotion while maintaining a safe and supportive space.", "Analyze the client's emotional response based on their astrological chart.", "Suggest the client needs pharmaceutical intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allowing and supporting emotional expression within a safe container is crucial. Grounding is important, but prematurely stopping the process can be disruptive.
