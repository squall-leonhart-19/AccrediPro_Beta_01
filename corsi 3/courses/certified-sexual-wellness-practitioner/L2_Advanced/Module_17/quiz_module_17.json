            "question": "A couple presents with significantly differing libidos. Which of the following is the MOST crucial initial step in addressing this disparity?",
            "options": ["Prescribing medication to increase the lower libido partner's desire.", "Encouraging the higher libido partner to find fulfillment outside the relationship.", "Facilitating open and honest communication about individual needs and expectations.", "Suggesting a trial separation to reassess compatibility."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open communication is fundamental. Before any interventions, understanding each partner's perspective is crucial for finding mutually agreeable solutions. Studies show communication-based interventions have a higher success rate than solely pharmacological approaches."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing sexual dysfunction following a traumatic event. Which therapeutic approach is generally considered the FIRST line of treatment?",
            "options": ["Exposure therapy focused on the traumatic event.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT).", "Prescription of PDE5 inhibitors to address erectile dysfunction.", "Hypnotherapy to suppress traumatic memories."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT or TF-CBT is recommended as the initial approach. These therapies address the cognitive and emotional impact of trauma, which often underlies sexual dysfunction. A 2018 meta-analysis showed TF-CBT significantly reduces PTSD symptoms and improves sexual functioning."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "When working with a client who has atypical sexual interests, which ethical principle is MOST important to uphold?",
            "options": ["Promoting normalization of all sexual behaviors.", "Ensuring the behavior is legal, consensual, and does not cause distress or harm to self or others.", "Encouraging the client to suppress the atypical interest.", "Attempting to convert the client to more conventional sexual preferences."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The key is to ensure the behavior is legal, consensual, and non-harmful. Therapists should maintain neutrality and avoid imposing their own values. Ethical guidelines emphasize respecting client autonomy within legal and ethical boundaries."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client reports significant performance anxiety during sexual encounters. Which of the following techniques would be MOST appropriate to introduce FIRST?",
            "options": ["Sensate focus exercises.", "Prescribing an anti-anxiety medication.", "Suggesting the client watch pornography to improve their technique.", "Recommending immediate use of erectile dysfunction medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Sensate focus exercises are a non-pharmacological approach that helps reduce anxiety by focusing on physical sensations rather than performance goals. They are considered a first-line intervention for performance anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client with multiple sclerosis (MS) reports decreased sexual sensation and difficulty achieving orgasm. What is the MOST appropriate initial step in addressing these concerns?",
            "options": ["Recommending immediate hormone replacement therapy.", "Referring the client for a comprehensive medical evaluation to rule out other potential causes and optimize MS management.", "Suggesting the client accept the changes as an inevitable consequence of MS.", "Encouraging the client to focus on non-sexual forms of intimacy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A medical evaluation is crucial to rule out other contributing factors (e.g., medication side effects, depression) and ensure optimal management of the MS itself. Addressing the underlying medical condition is often the most effective first step."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic differentiating compulsive sexual behavior from healthy sexual expression?",
            "options": ["Frequency of sexual activity.", "The presence of sexual fantasies.", "Significant distress or impairment in other areas of life due to sexual behavior.", "Engaging in a variety of sexual activities."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Compulsive sexual behavior is defined by the distress and impairment it causes. It's not simply about the frequency or type of sexual activity, but the negative impact on the individual's life. This aligns with diagnostic criteria for behavioral addictions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A lesbian client expresses discomfort with the pressure to conform to stereotypical 'butch' or 'femme' roles in her relationships. What is the MOST helpful approach a practitioner can take?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to embrace whichever role feels most natural.", "Explore her internalized societal expectations and help her define her own authentic expression of sexuality and gender.", "Suggest she seek relationships with men to avoid these stereotypes.", "Explain that these roles are a natural part of lesbian relationships."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring internalized expectations and promoting authentic self-expression is key. Therapists should help clients deconstruct societal pressures and define their own identities and relationship dynamics. This approach aligns with affirmative therapy principles."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios presents the MOST significant ethical concern for a sexual wellness practitioner?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sexual relationships with former clients are almost always unethical due to the power imbalance inherent in the therapeutic relationship. Even after therapy ends, the potential for exploitation remains. Professional codes of ethics strictly prohibit such relationships."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client recovering from a stroke reports a significant decrease in libido. They are concerned about the impact on their marriage. Besides medical referral, which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on alternative forms of intimacy is crucial. Following a stroke, physical and emotional changes can significantly impact sexual function. Exploring new ways to connect can help maintain intimacy and strengthen the relationship. A 2021 study found that couples who adapted their intimacy practices reported higher relationship satisfaction after a partner's stroke."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Affirming the validity of consensual BDSM, provided it adheres to the principles of safety, sanity, and consent (SSC), is the most appropriate response. A practitioner should avoid pathologizing non-harmful sexual behaviors."
