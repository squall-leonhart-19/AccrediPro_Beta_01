            "explanation": "Erratic pendulum movement often indicates interference or unclear energy. Grounding, clearing the space, and re-establishing a clear intention are crucial steps to ensure an accurate and reliable reading. Jumping to conclusions or ignoring the erratic movement could lead to inaccurate assessments and ineffective interventions."
