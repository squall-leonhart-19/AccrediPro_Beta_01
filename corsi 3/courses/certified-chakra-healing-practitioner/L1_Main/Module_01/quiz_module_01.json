            "options": ["Guaranteeing specific healing outcomes.", "Maintaining client confidentiality and informed consent.", "Promoting personal beliefs about chakra imbalances.", "Providing unsolicited advice on lifestyle changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During a visual assessment, you observe that a client consistently crosses their arms and avoids eye contact. According to lesson L2, this might indicate:",
            "options": ["An open and receptive attitude.", "A strong connection to their sacral chakra.", "Defensiveness or a blockage in the heart chakra.", "An overactive third eye chakra."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defensive body language, such as crossed arms and avoiding eye contact, can often indicate a blockage or imbalance within the heart chakra, which governs emotional connection and openness."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "When using a pendulum for dowsing, which of the following is the MOST accurate way to establish a 'yes' response?",
            "options": ["Assuming a clockwise rotation always means 'yes'.", "Determining the specific movement for 'yes' by asking the pendulum to show you.", "Relying on pre-determined charts without personal calibration.", "Ignoring the pendulum's movement if it contradicts your intuition."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a clear 'yes' response is crucial for accurate dowsing. This is best achieved by directly asking the pendulum to show you its 'yes' movement, ensuring a personalized and reliable connection."

            "question": "In muscle testing, a 'strong' muscle response generally indicates:",
            "options": ["A chakra blockage or energy deficiency.", "An affirmative response or energetic alignment.", "Dehydration or muscle fatigue.", "A negative emotional association."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong muscle response in muscle testing typically suggests an affirmative response, indicating that the statement or substance being tested is energetically aligned with the individual."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "According to the lessons, what is a primary benefit of using questionnaires and self-assessment tools in chakra assessment?",
            "options": ["They provide definitive and objective measurements of chakra balance.", "They eliminate the need for other assessment techniques.", "They offer subjective insights into the client's experience and perceived imbalances.", "They are universally accurate and applicable to all individuals."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Questionnaires and self-assessment tools offer valuable subjective insights into the client's personal experience and perceived imbalances, complementing other assessment techniques."

            "options": ["Relying solely on the technique that provides the most consistent results.", "Ignoring conflicting information and focusing on the most obvious imbalances.", "Cross-referencing findings from different techniques to identify patterns and gain a holistic understanding.", "Prioritizing objective data over subjective experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah, 35,' visual assessment revealed slumped posture and shallow breathing. This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["An overactive crown chakra.", "A balanced root chakra.", "Potential imbalances in the root and solar plexus chakras.", "A strong connection to the earth element."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slumped posture and shallow breathing are often associated with imbalances in the root (grounding, stability) and solar plexus (power, self-esteem) chakras. These physical cues can reflect underlying energetic blockages."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A client reports feeling disconnected from their body and experiences frequent anxiety. Dowsing indicates a weak root chakra and an overactive third eye chakra. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate as a starting point?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on balancing the third eye chakra.", "Initiating a rigorous meditation practice to enhance psychic abilities.", "Grounding exercises and activities to strengthen the root chakra.", "Recommending a complete chakra balancing session without addressing specific imbalances."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the client's reported disconnection and anxiety, combined with the dowsing results, grounding exercises and activities to strengthen the root chakra are the most appropriate starting point. Establishing a solid foundation is crucial before addressing higher chakras."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "You are using muscle testing to assess a client's sacral chakra. When you ask the client to hold a statement affirming their creativity, the muscle weakens. This suggests:",
            "options": ["The client has a strong and balanced sacral chakra.", "The client is intentionally resisting the muscle test.", "There may be an energetic blockage or limiting belief related to the client's creativity.", "The client is dehydrated and needs to drink more water."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A weak muscle response when affirming creativity suggests an energetic blockage or limiting belief related to the client's sacral chakra, which governs creativity, pleasure, and emotions. This indicates a need for further exploration and potential energetic interventions."
