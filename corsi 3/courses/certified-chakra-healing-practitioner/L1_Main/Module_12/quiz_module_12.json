            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which dowsing technique is MOST effective for identifying the *root cause* of a chakra imbalance, rather than just detecting its presence?",
            "options": ["Simple yes/no dowsing", "Chart dowsing with pre-defined categories", "Pendulum dowsing with open-ended questioning", "Muscle testing as a proxy for dowsing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questioning with a pendulum allows for deeper exploration beyond pre-defined limitations, uncovering nuanced root causes. Chart dowsing is useful but limited to the categories defined on the chart."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "In muscle testing for chakra assessment, a 'weak' muscle response generally indicates:",
            "options": ["A strong and balanced chakra", "An overactive chakra", "A blocked or deficient chakra", "A neutral or indifferent chakra"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A weak muscle response suggests that the energy flow to the corresponding chakra is compromised, indicating a blockage or deficiency. A strong response generally indicates a balanced or overactive chakra."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to the emotional mapping principles discussed, which emotion is MOST commonly associated with blockages in the solar plexus chakra?",
            "options": ["Grief", "Fear", "Shame", "Anger"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shame is strongly linked to the solar plexus chakra, affecting self-esteem, personal power, and the ability to assert oneself. While other emotions can contribute, shame is a primary factor."

        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Somatic awareness practices, like mindful movement, primarily aid in chakra blockage release by:",
            "options": ["Directly manipulating the chakra's energy field", "Bypassing the mind and accessing subconscious emotions stored in the body", "Releasing muscular tension and improving energy flow", "Enhancing the visual perception of chakra colors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Somatic practices release physical tension, which often accompanies and reinforces energetic blockages in the chakras. Addressing the physical component can facilitate emotional and energetic release."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Which crystal property is MOST important when selecting crystals for advanced chakra healing?",
            "options": ["Color", "Hardness", "Specific gravity", "Vibrational frequency"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While color and other properties are relevant, the vibrational frequency of a crystal is key to its ability to resonate with and balance specific chakras. This frequency influences the energy field."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Harmonic resonance in sound healing works by:",
            "options": ["Creating a loud and overwhelming sound wave", "Using specific frequencies to entrain and balance chakra vibrations", "Suppressing negative thoughts through auditory stimulation", "Masking other distracting sounds"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Harmonic resonance utilizes specific frequencies that align with and support the natural vibrational frequencies of the chakras, promoting balance and harmony. This is known as chakra entrainment."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "When crafting advanced affirmations for chakra empowerment, which element is MOST crucial for ensuring effectiveness?",
            "options": ["Using complex and poetic language", "Repeating the affirmation as many times as possible", "Stating the affirmation in the present tense and with strong emotion", "Writing the affirmation down on paper"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Affirmations are most effective when stated in the present tense (as if already true) and imbued with strong, positive emotion. This helps to reprogram subconscious beliefs and manifest desired outcomes."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In a case study using the A.L.I.G.N. framework, a client presented with chronic fatigue and feelings of disconnection. Which chakra would be the INITIAL focus of assessment and intervention?",
            "options": ["Crown Chakra", "Root Chakra", "Heart Chakra", "Third Eye Chakra"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The A.L.I.G.N. framework emphasizes grounding and stability. Therefore, the Root Chakra, associated with basic needs and security, would be the initial focus to address fatigue and disconnection."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing persistent throat chakra blockage, manifesting as difficulty expressing their needs and chronic sore throats. Which combination of techniques would be MOST appropriate according to module teachings?",
            "options": ["Root chakra affirmations, grounding exercises, and red crystals", "Solar plexus visualization, power posing, and citrine crystals", "Throat chakra affirmations, sound healing with 528 Hz, and blue crystals", "Third eye meditation, intuition exercises, and amethyst crystals"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Targeting the throat chakra with affirmations focused on self-expression, sound healing using frequencies that resonate with the throat chakra, and using crystals associated with communication (blue) would be the most direct and effective approach."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies cited in the module indicated that around 70% of individuals with chronic pain showed measurable chakra imbalances, suggesting a strong correlation between energetic blockages and physical symptoms."
