 <section id="personal-welcome">
 <h2>A Heartfelt Welcome from Luna Sinclair</h2>
 <p>Hi, I'm Luna Sinclair, and I am SO excited you're here! I'm the lead coach and creator of this Certified
 Chakra Healing Practitioner™ program, and I've poured my heart and soul into creating a truly
 transformative experience for you.</p>

 <p>My journey to becoming an energy healing and sacred intimacy guide wasn't exactly a straight line. For
 years, I was completely disconnected from my body. I spent so much time pushing down emotions, living
 in my head, and honestly, numbing myself through work. Intimacy? Forget about it. My marriage was
 sexless, and not for lack of trying. I would literally dissociate during those moments. Doctor after
 doctor told me nothing was physically wrong, but I felt broken in a way no one could see.</p>

 <p>Then, everything shifted. A somatic healer introduced me to energy work. The first time I felt my own
 chi move through my body, I sobbed for an hour. It was like waking up after a lifetime of sleepwalking.
 I trained in Reiki, Tantra, and breathwork. I healed my sexual trauma layer by layer and reconnected
 to pleasure as a birthright. My marriage transformed. That's when I knew I had to bring this work to
 other women.</p>

 <p>Today, I guide women and couples through energetic and intimate reconnection, earning $16,500/month, and
 I've helped 350+ clients heal sexual trauma, reignite dead bedrooms, and experience embodied pleasure
 many thought was impossible for them. My personal quote that I live by is: <span class="highlight">"Your body holds ancient wisdom and stored pain. When we release what's stuck, pleasure and vitality flow naturally."</span>, and I want to share that with you!</p>

 <p>That's why I created this program – to empower YOU to tap into your innate healing abilities and create
 a fulfilling career doing work you love. I believe in the power of energy healing to transform lives,
 and I believe in <span class="highlight">YOU</span>. I know you can do this!</p>
 </section>

 <!-- You Belong Here -->
 <section id="you-belong-here">
 <h2>You Belong Here – No Matter Your Age or Background</h2>
 <p>Now, let's address something that might be swirling around in your mind: imposter syndrome. Maybe you're
 thinking, "Am I too old to start a new career? Do I have what it takes?"</p>

 <p>If you're in your 40s, 50s, or beyond – you're <span class="highlight">EXACTLY</span> who we need! Your
 life experience is your superpower. You bring a level of wisdom, empathy, and understanding that simply
 can't be taught in a classroom.</p>

 <p>Think about it: you've navigated relationships, raised families, overcome challenges, and learned valuable
 lessons along the way. These experiences have shaped you into the compassionate and insightful person
 you are today, and they will make you an exceptional Chakra Healing Practitioner™.</p>

 <p>Don't let anyone tell you that you're "too old" or "too late." It's never too late to pursue your passions
 and create a career that aligns with your values. In fact, many of the most successful practitioners
 are career changers who discovered their calling later in life.</p>

 <!-- Community -->
 <section id="community">
 <h2>You're Not Alone: Your Cohort & Community</h2>
 <p>One of the most valuable aspects of this program is the incredible community of like-minded individuals
 you'll be joining. You're not alone on this journey! We've created a supportive and collaborative
 environment where you can connect with fellow students, share your experiences, and learn from each
 other.</p>

 <p>As part of the program, you'll be assigned to a Private Practice Group (POD) – a small group of students
 who will become your accountability partners and support system throughout the certification process.
 You'll have regular check-ins, group discussions, and opportunities to collaborate on projects.</p>

 <p>In addition to your POD, you'll also have access to our online community forum, where you can connect
 with all of the students in your cohort, ask questions, share resources, and celebrate your successes.
 This is a safe and supportive space where you can be yourself, learn from others, and build lasting
 relationships.</p>
 </section>

 <!-- First Steps -->
 <section id="first-steps">
 <h2>Your First Steps to Success</h2>
 <p>Okay, are you ready to dive in? Here are your first steps to get the most out of this program:</p>
 <ol>
 <li><strong>Introduce yourself in the community forum:</strong> Let your fellow students know who you are,
 where you're from, and what you hope to achieve with this certification.</li>
 <li><strong>Connect with your Private Practice Group (POD):</strong> Reach out to your POD members and
 schedule your first check-in.</li>
 <li><strong>Set aside dedicated time for learning:</strong> Treat this program like a serious commitment, and
 schedule regular study sessions in your calendar.</li>
 <li><strong>Be open to new experiences:</strong> Chakra healing is a journey of self-discovery, so be open to
 exploring your own energy field and releasing any limiting beliefs.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>I'm so excited to be on this journey with you. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way.
