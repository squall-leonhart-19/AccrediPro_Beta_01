            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "In the context of advanced dowsing techniques for chakra assessment, what is the significance of 'ideomotor response' as discussed in Lesson 2?",
            "options": ["It refers to a conscious decision made by the practitioner to influence the dowsing rod's movement.", "It describes subconscious muscular movements that respond to the practitioner's internal awareness and energetic sensitivity.", "It indicates a malfunction in the dowsing equipment requiring immediate recalibration.", "It suggests external environmental interference affecting the accuracy of the dowsing results."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ideomotor response is the underlying mechanism by which dowsing tools respond to subtle energetic shifts detected by the practitioner's subconscious."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, which of the following is a critical factor to consider when performing muscle testing for chakra evaluation to ensure accurate results?",
            "options": ["The client's physical strength and overall fitness level.", "Maintaining a neutral and unbiased mindset, free from preconceived notions about the client's condition.", "Using maximum force during muscle testing to elicit a clear response.", "Performing muscle testing immediately after strenuous physical activity."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["Focusing solely on physical symptoms associated with each chakra.", "Ensuring that all questions are easily answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'.", "Covering a broad range of physical, emotional, and spiritual indicators relevant to each chakra's function.", "Prioritizing questions that align with the practitioner's personal beliefs about chakra imbalances."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive questionnaire should explore the multifaceted aspects of each chakra, including physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions, to provide a holistic view."

            "options": ["Electromyography (EMG).", "Electroencephalography (EEG).", "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR).", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback combined with specific chakra meditations."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "HRV biofeedback, when combined with chakra-specific meditations, can provide insights into the coherence and balance of the chakra system."

            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports feeling persistently fatigued and emotionally blocked, particularly in her lower abdomen. Dowsing indicates an imbalance in her Sacral Chakra. Muscle testing shows weakness when testing the same chakra. According to best practices, what is the MOST ethical next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin intensive Sacral Chakra healing sessions.", "Dismiss the client's symptoms as psychosomatic.", "Explain the findings to Sarah, emphasizing that these are indicators and not definitive diagnoses, and collaborate with her to explore potential contributing factors and appropriate interventions.", "Recommend surgery to correct the perceived chakra imbalance."],
