        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following research methodologies is MOST suited for in-depth exploration of individual experiences with chakra healing?",
            "options": ["Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)", "Meta-analysis", "Case Study", "Cross-sectional Survey"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case studies allow for detailed examination of individual experiences, capturing the nuances often missed in quantitative studies. RCTs are better for establishing cause-and-effect relationships in larger populations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A researcher aims to investigate the immediate physiological effects of a specific chakra meditation technique. Which measurement would be MOST appropriate to include?",
            "options": ["Long-term psychological well-being questionnaires", "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)", "Dietary habits over a month", "Childhood trauma history"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "GSR measures changes in sweat gland activity, reflecting immediate changes in arousal and stress levels, making it suitable for capturing immediate physiological responses."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is a primary concern when interpreting results from studies on chakra healing that lack a control group?",
            "options": ["Increased statistical power", "Difficulty attributing changes specifically to the chakra intervention", "Reduced participant bias", "Simplified data analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without a control group, it is difficult to determine if observed changes are due to the chakra intervention, the placebo effect, or other extraneous factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In a study examining the effect of chakra balancing on anxiety, researchers found a statistically significant reduction in anxiety scores (p < 0.05). What does this p-value indicate?",
            "options": ["The probability of observing the results if the chakra balancing has no effect is less than 5%", "The chakra balancing is 95% effective in reducing anxiety", "The study has a 5% chance of being replicated", "The sample size is too small"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A p-value of less than 0.05 suggests that the observed results are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis (no effect of chakra balancing) is true."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased energy and emotional stability after consistent chakra healing sessions. To document this as a case study, what is the MOST important element to include?",
            "options": ["Photographs of the client's aura", "Detailed description of the chakra balancing techniques used and specific, measurable outcomes", "The practitioner's personal feelings about the client's progress", "Astrological chart analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A well-documented case study should include a clear description of the intervention and specific, measurable outcomes to provide evidence of its effectiveness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, which physiological system is MOST commonly associated with changes during chakra meditation practices?",
            "options": ["Digestive System", "Cardiovascular System", "Skeletal System", "Lymphatic System"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that chakra meditation practices can influence heart rate variability, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular parameters, indicating a strong connection."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical consideration when conducting chakra healing research involving vulnerable populations (e.g., individuals with severe mental health conditions)?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the intervention is effective for everyone", "Obtaining fully informed consent and ensuring voluntary participation", "Guaranteeing a positive outcome for all participants", "Publishing the results regardless of the findings"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is paramount, ensuring participants understand the risks and benefits and can freely choose to participate without coercion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 15 studies (n=540) on chakra balancing for depression reported a small but statistically significant effect size (Cohen's d = 0.35, 95% CI [0.12, 0.58]). What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["Chakra balancing is highly effective for treating depression.", "The effect of chakra balancing on depression is likely minimal, although the confidence interval suggests it is statistically significant.", "The studies included in the meta-analysis were likely of poor quality.", "The sample size was too small to draw any meaningful conclusions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Cohen's d of 0.35 is generally considered a small effect size, suggesting that the practical significance of the findings may be limited, even though the confidence interval indicates statistical significance."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key consideration when designing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of chakra healing?",
            "options": ["Excluding participants who are skeptical of chakra healing", "Ensuring all participants receive the chakra healing intervention", "Randomly assigning participants to either the chakra healing group or a control group", "Allowing participants to choose which treatment group they prefer"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Random assignment is a core principle of RCTs, minimizing bias and ensuring that groups are comparable at baseline."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Future research in chakra healing is MOST likely to benefit from:",
            "options": ["Relying solely on anecdotal evidence", "Ignoring the placebo effect", "Integrating neuroimaging techniques to explore the neural correlates of chakra activation", "Focusing exclusively on subjective experiences"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroimaging techniques can provide objective data on brain activity associated with chakra practices, enhancing the scientific understanding of their potential effects."
