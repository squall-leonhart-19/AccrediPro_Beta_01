            "question": "An endurance athlete is looking to optimize glycogen resynthesis after a 3-hour cycling session. Which nutrient timing strategy is MOST effective according to current research?",
            "options": [
                "Consuming a high-fat meal immediately post-exercise to spare glycogen.",
                "Ingesting 1.0-1.2g/kg of carbohydrate within the first 30-60 minutes post-exercise.",
                "Delaying carbohydrate intake for 2-3 hours post-exercise to promote fat oxidation.",
                "Focusing solely on protein intake post-exercise, as it's the primary driver of muscle recovery."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that immediate carbohydrate intake (1.0-1.2g/kg) post-exercise maximizes glycogen resynthesis rates. A study by Ivy et al. (1988) demonstrated this effect, showing significantly higher glycogen stores compared to delayed carbohydrate intake."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing persistent anxiety and digestive discomfort. Which gut-brain axis intervention is MOST likely to provide synergistic benefits for both conditions?",
            "options": [
                "A high-dose probiotic supplement containing only Lactobacillus strains.",
                "A diet rich in prebiotic fibers, combined with stress-reduction techniques like mindfulness.",

                "Focusing solely on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) without addressing dietary factors."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prebiotic fibers nourish beneficial gut bacteria, promoting the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve mood. Combining this with stress-reduction techniques addresses both the gut and brain components of the axis."

                "Intermittent fasting with prolonged periods of caloric restriction (e.g., 24-hour fasts)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The American Diabetes Association recommends a Mediterranean-style diet for managing insulin resistance. This approach emphasizes whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats, promoting stable blood sugar levels and improved insulin sensitivity. A meta-analysis by Ajala et al.

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. T4 (thyroxine) contains four iodine atoms, and T3 (triiodothyronine) contains three. Insufficient iodine intake can lead to hypothyroidism."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that a gluten-free diet may reduce thyroid antibody levels in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, even in the absence of celiac disease. A study by Krysiak et al. (2019) found a significant reduction in anti-TPO antibody titers in Hashimoto's patients following a gluten-free diet."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Repeated exposure to vegetables in various forms, paired with preferred foods, can gradually increase acceptance and consumption. Ellyn Satter's Division of Responsibility in Feeding emphasizes creating a positive mealtime environment and allowing children to choose what and how much they eat from a selection of healthy foods."
