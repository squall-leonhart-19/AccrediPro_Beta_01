            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in a targeted assessment for holistic nutrition?",
            "options": ["Ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel", "Conducting a comprehensive client history", "Performing a physical examination", "Administering a nutrient deficiency questionnaire"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive client history provides the foundation for identifying potential nutritional imbalances and guiding further assessment strategies. As discussed in L2, this allows for targeted testing and prevents unnecessary interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing frequent muscle cramps, fatigue, and heart palpitations. According to the nutrient deficiency screening guidelines discussed in L4, which mineral deficiency is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Vitamin D", "Magnesium", "Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Muscle cramps, fatigue, and heart palpitations are common symptoms of magnesium deficiency. Lesson 4 highlighted the importance of recognizing symptom clusters associated with specific nutrient deficiencies."
        },

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle factors, as emphasized in L3, has the MOST significant impact on nutrient absorption and utilization?",
            "options": ["Frequency of social gatherings", "Daily commute time", "Stress levels and sleep quality", "Choice of entertainment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and poor sleep quality can negatively impact gut health, hormone balance, and overall nutrient absorption. Lifestyle Assessment in L3, particularly the case study on stress management, underscores this point."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In the context of functional nutrition assessment tools (L5), what is the primary purpose of a food journal?",
            "options": ["To track calorie intake for weight loss purposes only", "To identify potential food sensitivities and dietary patterns", "To monitor adherence to a specific diet plan", "To provide a detailed analysis of macronutrient ratios"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Food journals are primarily used to identify potential food sensitivities, dietary patterns, and triggers for symptoms. L5 emphasized the importance of qualitative data from food journals in conjunction with quantitative analysis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "During a physical examination, you observe koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails) in a client. According to L6, this finding is MOST indicative of which nutrient deficiency?",
            "options": ["Vitamin B12", "Iron", "Zinc", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Koilonychia, or spoon-shaped nails, is a classic sign of iron deficiency anemia. Physical Examination Techniques (L6) provided visual cues for recognizing common nutrient deficiencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client's lab results show elevated homocysteine levels. Based on the information from L7, this could indicate a deficiency in which of the following nutrients?",
            "options": ["Vitamin A", "Vitamin C", "Folate, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B6", "Vitamin E"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated homocysteine levels often indicate deficiencies in folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6, all of which are involved in homocysteine metabolism. Laboratory Testing (L7) highlighted the clinical significance of homocysteine as a biomarker."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, presents with fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues. Her client history reveals a history of chronic stress and processed food consumption. A nutrient deficiency questionnaire indicates potential deficiencies in B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. Which of the following laboratory tests (L7) would be MOST appropriate to further investigate her condition?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Metabolic Panel only", "Vitamin D level only", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis and Fatty Acid Profile", "Complete Blood Count only"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's symptoms and history, a Comprehensive Stool Analysis and Fatty Acid Profile would provide valuable information about her gut health and omega-3 status, addressing both digestive issues and potential nutrient deficiencies. This aligns with the targeted assessment approach discussed in L8."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "According to L8, when synthesizing assessment data to develop a personalized nutrition plan, what is the MOST important factor to consider?",
            "options": ["Following the latest dietary trends", "Prioritizing the client's preferences and goals", "Strictly adhering to a standardized protocol", "Focusing solely on laboratory results"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's preferences and goals is crucial for adherence and long-term success. L8 emphasized the importance of client-centered care and tailoring the nutrition plan to individual needs and lifestyle."

            "options": ["Blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg", "Client reports feeling anxious and having difficulty sleeping", "Hair analysis showing elevated levels of mercury", "Urine test indicating a UTI"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subjective findings are based on the client's perceptions, feelings, and experiences, such as reporting anxiety and sleep difficulties. This contrasts with objective measures like blood pressure readings or lab results."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client presents with angular cheilitis (cracks at the corners of the mouth). While this can be indicative of several deficiencies, which of the following is MOST likely, based on L6 and common nutritional deficiencies?",
            "options": ["Vitamin K deficiency", "Vitamin A deficiency", "B Vitamin deficiency (especially Riboflavin)", "Calcium deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Angular cheilitis is often associated with a deficiency in B vitamins, particularly riboflavin (B2). While other deficiencies can contribute, B vitamin deficiencies are a primary consideration in this presentation."
