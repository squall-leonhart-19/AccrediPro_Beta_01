            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, consuming carbohydrates with protein post-exercise can enhance muscle glycogen replenishment. What is the generally recommended carbohydrate-to-protein ratio for optimizing this process?",
            "options": ["1:1", "2:1", "3:1", "4:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 3:1 or 4:1 carbohydrate-to-protein ratio is often recommended to maximize glycogen synthesis post-exercise, based on studies showing improved insulin response and glycogen storage."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing muscle cramps during prolonged endurance activities in hot weather. Which hydration strategy is MOST likely to alleviate these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Drinking only plain water", "Consuming a sports drink containing electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium", "Avoiding fluids altogether to prevent bloating", "Drinking only sugary beverages for quick energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Electrolytes, particularly sodium and potassium, are lost through sweat and are crucial for maintaining fluid balance and muscle function. Sports drinks help replenish these electrolytes, preventing muscle cramps."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Based on the module's discussion of nutritional strategies for managing chronic inflammation, which dietary pattern is characterized by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids, and is often recommended for its anti-inflammatory properties?",
            "options": ["The Standard American Diet (SAD)", "The Mediterranean Diet", "The Paleolithic Diet", "The Ketogenic Diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mediterranean Diet is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and has been shown in numerous studies to reduce markers of inflammation. Its emphasis on whole foods and healthy fats contributes to its beneficial effects."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A nutrigenomics test reveals that a client has a genetic variant associated with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Which of the following nutritional recommendations is MOST appropriate for this client?",
            "options": ["Restricting vitamin D intake to avoid toxicity", "Ignoring the genetic result and following general vitamin D guidelines", "Increasing vitamin D intake through supplementation and fortified foods, while monitoring blood levels", "Decreasing calcium intake to balance vitamin D levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individuals with genetic predispositions to vitamin D deficiency may require higher intakes to maintain optimal blood levels. Monitoring blood levels is essential to ensure adequate intake without causing toxicity. A 2021 study demonstrated that individuals with certain VDR gene polymorphisms required significantly higher vitamin D supplementation to achieve optimal serum levels."

            "options": ["Implementing a highly restrictive elimination diet without guidance", "Focusing solely on macronutrient intake", "Introducing targeted probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing nutrients", "Ignoring digestive symptoms and focusing on other areas"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Restore & Rebuild' phase often involves addressing gut health by introducing targeted interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and nutrients that support gut lining integrity and microbial balance."

            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 45), has been consistently following a personalized nutrition plan based on the THRIVE Framework™ for six months. She initially presented with low energy and digestive issues. Now, she reports improved energy levels and better digestion, but feels stuck and wants to optimize further. Which stage of the THRIVE Framework™ is Sarah currently in?",
            "options": ["Targeted Assessment", "Holistic Harmony", "Integrate, Vitality, Evolve", "Restore & Rebuild"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client with chronic inflammation is considering supplementing with curcumin. What key factor should you advise them to consider regarding curcumin absorption?",
            "options": ["Curcumin is readily absorbed, so any form is effective", "Curcumin absorption is enhanced when combined with piperine (black pepper extract)", "Curcumin should only be taken on an empty stomach", "Curcumin is best absorbed when dissolved in water"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin has poor bioavailability on its own. Piperine, found in black pepper, significantly enhances its absorption by inhibiting certain metabolic pathways. Studies have shown up to a 2000% increase in bioavailability when curcumin is combined with piperine."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "In a case study presented, a 32-year-old male athlete improved his performance by strategically timing carbohydrate intake around his training sessions. Specifically, how did he adjust his carbohydrate consumption?",
            "options": ["He eliminated carbohydrates entirely from his diet.", "He consumed the majority of his carbohydrates in the morning.", "He focused on consuming simple sugars before and after workouts.", "He prioritized complex carbohydrates before and after workouts, with a smaller amount of simple sugars immediately post-workout."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the benefits of strategically timing carbohydrate intake. The athlete consumed complex carbohydrates before and after workouts to provide sustained energy and replenish glycogen stores, with a small amount of simple sugars immediately post-workout for rapid recovery. This approach optimizes both performance and recovery."
