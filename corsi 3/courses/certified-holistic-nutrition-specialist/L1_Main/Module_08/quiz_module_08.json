            "options": ["Completely eradicating all bacteria from the gut.", "Rebalancing the gut microbiome through targeted dietary and lifestyle interventions.", "Solely focusing on increasing fiber intake.", "Ignoring the gut microbiome and focusing on nutrient supplementation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal is to restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria, not eliminate all bacteria. This involves identifying and addressing factors contributing to dysbiosis and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria."
