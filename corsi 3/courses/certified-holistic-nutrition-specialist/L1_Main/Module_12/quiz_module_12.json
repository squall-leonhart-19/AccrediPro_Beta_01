            "question": "Which of the following dietary approaches is MOST supported by research in managing autoimmune conditions, particularly Hashimoto's thyroiditis, due to its potential to reduce inflammation and thyroid antibodies, as discussed in the lesson?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet", "Strict vegan diet", "Standard American Diet (SAD)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet focuses on eliminating foods that commonly trigger inflammation and autoimmune responses, like grains, legumes, nightshades, dairy, eggs, nuts, and seeds, and is supported by research in reducing inflammation and thyroid antibodies, particularly in Hashimoto's thyroiditis."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of fatigue, headaches, and skin rashes. Their genetic testing reveals a homozygous mutation in the MTHFR gene. Based on the lesson on optimizing detoxification, which of the following supplementation strategies would be MOST appropriate to support their detoxification pathways?",
            "options": ["High doses of vitamin C", "Folinic acid and methylcobalamin", "Activated charcoal", "Glutathione only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A homozygous MTHFR mutation can impair methylation, a crucial detoxification process. Folinic acid and methylcobalamin are the active forms of folate and B12, respectively, that bypass the impaired MTHFR enzyme, supporting methylation and detoxification. As discussed, a balanced approach is critical."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client with type 2 diabetes has consistently elevated fasting blood glucose levels despite following a low-glycemic diet. Advanced testing reveals significant insulin resistance. Which of the following strategies, beyond diet, would be MOST effective in improving insulin sensitivity?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Prolonged, low-intensity cardio", "Intermittent fasting with a focus on protein intake", "Avoiding all forms of exercise"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Intermittent fasting, combined with a focus on adequate protein intake, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The fasting period allows insulin levels to decrease, while sufficient protein helps maintain muscle mass and metabolic rate."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key consideration when implementing advanced hormone balancing strategies, particularly in the context of estrogen dominance, as covered in the hormone balancing lesson?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating all sources of phytoestrogens", "Focusing solely on increasing estrogen levels", "Supporting liver detoxification pathways to metabolize excess estrogen", "Ignoring gut health as it has no impact on hormone balance"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Supporting liver detoxification pathways, particularly phase I and phase II, is crucial for metabolizing and eliminating excess estrogen. Impaired liver function can contribute to estrogen dominance. Gut health also plays a significant role in estrogen metabolism."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client presents with bloating, gas, and abdominal pain, and SIBO is suspected. Lactulose breath testing confirms the presence of SIBO. Which of the following dietary approaches, combined with antimicrobial treatment, is MOST appropriate for managing SIBO?",
            "options": ["High-FODMAP diet", "Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) or Low-FODMAP diet", "Strict ketogenic diet", "Unlimited fiber intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) or Low-FODMAP diet restricts fermentable carbohydrates that feed the bacteria in the small intestine, helping to reduce SIBO symptoms. This is typically combined with antimicrobial treatment, as discussed in the SIBO lesson."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the lesson, what is a key factor, beyond calorie restriction, that contributes to successful long-term weight management?",
            "options": ["Strictly avoiding all carbohydrates", "Focusing on nutrient density and hormonal balance", "Relying solely on artificial sweeteners", "Ignoring the gut microbiome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on nutrient density and hormonal balance is crucial for long-term weight management. Nutrient-dense foods support satiety and metabolic function, while addressing hormonal imbalances can optimize fat metabolism and appetite regulation. Studies show that calorie restriction alone is often insufficient."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "A client's genetic testing reveals a variant associated with increased sensitivity to saturated fat. Based on the principles of personalized nutrition and nutrigenomics, which of the following dietary recommendations would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encourage a diet high in saturated fat to 'desensitize' the body", "Recommend a diet lower in saturated fat, emphasizing unsaturated fats", "Completely eliminate all dietary fat", "No changes are needed, as genetics are not deterministic"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In personalized nutrition, understanding genetic predispositions allows for tailoring dietary recommendations. If a client has a genetic variant associated with increased sensitivity to saturated fat, a diet lower in saturated fat and higher in unsaturated fats would be a more appropriate and personalized approach."

            "question": "A client is considering taking St. John's Wort for mild depression. What is the MOST important consideration regarding advanced supplementation strategies before recommending this supplement?",
            "options": ["St. John's Wort has no known drug interactions.", "St. John's Wort can interact with several medications, including antidepressants and birth control pills.", "St. John's Wort is safe for everyone.", "St. John's Wort only interacts with grapefruit juice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is known to interact with numerous medications, including antidepressants, birth control pills, and blood thinners, due to its effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes. It's crucial to assess potential drug interactions before recommending this supplement."

            "question": "A client with rheumatoid arthritis is experiencing significant joint pain and inflammation. In addition to dietary modifications, which of the following supplements has the STRONGEST evidence base for reducing inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis, as discussed in the supplementation lesson?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Turmeric/Curcumin", "Calcium", "Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Turmeric/Curcumin has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and has shown promise in reducing joint pain and inflammation in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis in several clinical trials. The lesson emphasizes the importance of evidence-based supplementation."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client is looking to optimize their gut health after a course of antibiotics. Which of the following advanced strategies would be MOST effective in restoring the gut microbiome's diversity and function?",
            "options": ["Consuming only prebiotic supplements", "Consuming a broad-spectrum probiotic with diverse strains AND incorporating fermented foods", "Avoiding all fiber", "Taking a single strain probiotic"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restoring gut microbiome diversity requires a multifaceted approach. A broad-spectrum probiotic with diverse strains can help repopulate the gut with beneficial bacteria, while incorporating fermented foods provides a variety of beneficial microbes and prebiotics. This synergistic approach is more effective than probiotics alone."
