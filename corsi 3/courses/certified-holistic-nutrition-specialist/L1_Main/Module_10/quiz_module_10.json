            "question": "Which of the following nutrient timing strategies is MOST effective for maximizing muscle protein synthesis after a high-intensity resistance training workout, based on current research?",
            "options": ["Consuming 10g of protein immediately post-workout.", "Consuming 40g of protein within a 2-hour window post-workout.", "Delaying protein intake for 4 hours post-workout to enhance fat oxidation.", "Combining 20g of protein with 60g of high-glycemic carbohydrates immediately post-workout."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that combining protein and carbohydrates post-workout, particularly high-glycemic carbs, can stimulate insulin release, which enhances amino acid uptake and muscle protein synthesis. A meta-analysis showed that this combination resulted in significantly greater muscle growth compared to protein alone."

            "question": "A 35-year-old female client, Sarah, reports chronic dehydration despite drinking 8 glasses of water daily. She experiences frequent headaches and fatigue. Which of the following personalized hydration strategies would be MOST appropriate to recommend initially?",
            "options": ["Increase water intake to 12 glasses daily.", "Recommend electrolyte-rich beverages, such as coconut water, and increasing dietary sodium intake.", "Advise her to switch to distilled water for better absorption.", "Suggest taking a diuretic to reduce water retention."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increasing electrolyte intake, particularly sodium, potassium, and magnesium, can improve hydration by enhancing water retention and cellular hydration. Coconut water is a natural source of these electrolytes. Simply increasing water intake may not address the underlying issue of electrolyte imbalance."

            "question": "Which of the following gut-brain axis interventions has demonstrated the MOST significant positive impact on reducing anxiety symptoms, according to a recent meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin D supplementation.", "A diet high in processed foods.", "Probiotic supplementation with strains known to produce GABA and SCFAs.", "Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses have shown that specific probiotic strains, particularly those that produce GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and SCFAs (short-chain fatty acids), can positively influence the gut-brain axis and reduce anxiety symptoms. These metabolites can directly affect neurotransmitter function."

            "question": "Based on the lessons, which dietary strategy is MOST effective for managing chronic inflammation in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis?",
            "options": ["A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.", "A gluten-free diet regardless of gluten sensitivity.", "An elimination diet followed by careful reintroduction to identify trigger foods, combined with omega-3 supplementation.", "A diet high in saturated fats to support hormone production."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet helps identify specific food sensitivities that contribute to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Combining this with omega-3 fatty acids, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, provides a comprehensive approach."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important phase of liver detoxification that requires specific nutrients to function optimally?",
            "options": ["Phase 0: Nutrient absorption.", "Phase 1: Activation.", "Phase 2: Conjugation.", "Phase 3: Elimination."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase 2, conjugation, is crucial for making toxins water-soluble so they can be eliminated. This phase requires specific nutrients like glutathione, glycine, and taurine. Impaired Phase 2 function can lead to a buildup of intermediate metabolites that are more toxic than the original substance."

            "question": "A client, John, struggles with weight management despite following a calorie-restricted diet. He reports persistent cravings and low energy levels. What advanced strategy, beyond calorie counting, should be prioritized?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a very low-calorie diet (VLCD).", "Focusing on improving sleep quality and managing stress hormones.", "Recommending artificial sweeteners to reduce sugar intake.", "Encouraging extreme exercise to burn more calories."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep deprivation and chronic stress can significantly impact hormones like cortisol and ghrelin, leading to increased cravings and metabolic dysfunction. Addressing these factors is crucial for sustainable weight management beyond simple calorie restriction. Studies show improved sleep is linked to better weight loss outcomes."

            "question": "In managing autoimmune conditions through personalized nutrition, which of the following is the MOST critical initial step?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting a ketogenic diet.", "Implementing a comprehensive gut health assessment and addressing any imbalances.", "Recommending high doses of immunosuppressant supplements.", "Focusing solely on eliminating gluten and dairy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut health plays a significant role in autoimmune conditions. Assessing and addressing imbalances like leaky gut, dysbiosis, and inflammation is a foundational step in personalized nutrition for autoimmune management. This approach is supported by research demonstrating the link between gut permeability and autoimmune activation."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "An endurance athlete is preparing for a marathon. Which advanced sports nutrition strategy is MOST likely to improve their performance and reduce the risk of muscle fatigue during the race?",
            "options": ["Carbohydrate loading with simple sugars the day before the race.", "Implementing a cyclical ketogenic diet to enhance fat adaptation.", "Optimizing hydration with sodium-containing beverages and consuming carbohydrates during the race.", "Avoiding all carbohydrates to force the body to burn fat for fuel."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During endurance events, maintaining hydration and replenishing carbohydrate stores is crucial for performance. Sodium-containing beverages help with fluid retention, and carbohydrate intake provides readily available energy. Carbohydrate loading involves consuming high amounts of complex carbohydrates in the days leading up to the event, not just the day before."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is experiencing persistent fatigue and brain fog despite thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Which nutrient is MOST crucial to assess and potentially supplement to support thyroid hormone conversion?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Selenium", "Calcium", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for the conversion of T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) to T3 (active thyroid hormone). In Hashimoto's, the autoimmune attack can impair this conversion, and selenium supplementation may help improve thyroid function and reduce symptoms. Studies show that selenium can reduce thyroid antibody levels."

            "question": "Which of the following advanced detoxification strategies is MOST effective for enhancing glutathione production in individuals with high toxic exposure?",
            "options": ["Fasting for 72 hours.", "High-dose vitamin A supplementation.", "Consuming foods rich in sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cruciferous vegetables, and supplementing with N-acetylcysteine (NAC).", "Avoiding all fruits and vegetables."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glutathione is a critical antioxidant and detoxification enzyme. Sulfur-containing amino acids are precursors to glutathione synthesis, and NAC is a direct precursor. Cruciferous vegetables provide these amino acids, and NAC supplementation can further boost glutathione production. Research supports NAC's role in enhancing glutathione levels."
