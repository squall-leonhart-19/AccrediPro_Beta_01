            "question": "Which of the following nutrient timing strategies is MOST effective for maximizing muscle protein synthesis post-resistance training, according to recent research?",
            "options": ["Consuming 10g of protein immediately after training.", "Consuming 40g of protein within a 2-hour window post-training.", "Delaying protein intake for 3 hours to enhance fat oxidation.", "Consuming a high-carbohydrate meal with minimal protein."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client presents with persistent bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements. Stool testing reveals dysbiosis with an overgrowth of *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Which dietary intervention is MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["A high-FODMAP diet to nourish beneficial bacteria.", "A low-FODMAP diet to reduce substrate for bacterial fermentation.", "A diet rich in resistant starch to promote butyrate production.", "A ketogenic diet to eliminate carbohydrate sources."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet is often recommended as an initial step to reduce substrate for bacterial fermentation and alleviate symptoms associated with dysbiosis, particularly when *Klebsiella pneumoniae* is overgrown."

            "question": "Which of the following supplements has the STRONGEST evidence for improving sleep quality and reducing sleep latency, based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials?",
            "options": ["Valerian root.", "Melatonin.", "L-Theanine.", "Magnesium glycinate."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses consistently show that melatonin supplementation can improve sleep quality and reduce sleep latency, especially in individuals with delayed sleep phase syndrome or those experiencing jet lag."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client reports symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and irregular menstrual cycles. Bloodwork reveals elevated cortisol levels and low progesterone. Which nutritional strategy is MOST likely to support hormonal balance in this scenario?",
            "options": ["A very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.", "A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables and adaptogens.", "A high-sugar, low-fat diet.", "Intermittent fasting with prolonged fasting windows."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cruciferous vegetables support estrogen detoxification, while adaptogens like ashwagandha can help regulate cortisol levels, both of which can contribute to hormonal balance in this scenario. The case study on Sarah (age 48) in Lesson 4 demonstrated the efficacy of this approach."

            "question": "Which phase of liver detoxification primarily involves the conjugation of toxins with other molecules to make them water-soluble for excretion?",
            "options": ["Phase 0.", "Phase I.", "Phase II.", "Phase III."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification involves conjugation reactions, where toxins are combined with molecules like glutathione, glucuronic acid, or sulfate to increase their water solubility and facilitate excretion."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "According to research on weight management, which macronutrient distribution has been shown to be MOST effective for long-term weight loss maintenance, considering individual metabolic differences?",
            "options": ["A consistently high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet for all individuals.", "A one-size-fits-all macronutrient ratio regardless of individual needs.", "A personalized macronutrient distribution based on individual factors like insulin sensitivity and activity level.", "A ketogenic diet exclusively for all clients seeking weight loss."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personalized nutrition approaches, tailoring macronutrient ratios to individual factors like insulin sensitivity, activity level, and preferences, have demonstrated superior long-term weight loss maintenance compared to generic, one-size-fits-all approaches."

            "options": ["Iron.", "Vitamin C.", "Selenium.", "Calcium."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is crucial for thyroid hormone production and has been shown to reduce anti-TPO antibody levels in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid."

            "options": ["Taking all supplements in the morning.", "Taking all supplements before bed.", "Moving stimulating supplements (e.g., B vitamins) to the morning and calming supplements (e.g., magnesium) to the evening.", "Discontinuing all supplements immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adjusting the timing of supplements to align with their intended effects can help mitigate side effects. Moving stimulating supplements to the morning and calming supplements to the evening can optimize energy levels during the day and promote better sleep at night."
