            "question": "Which of the following nutrient timing strategies is MOST effective for maximizing muscle protein synthesis post-resistance training, based on current research?",
            "options": ["Consuming a large carbohydrate-rich meal immediately after training.", "Ingesting 20-40g of high-quality protein within 1-2 hours post-training.", "Delaying protein intake for at least 3 hours to allow for optimal fat oxidation.", "Focusing solely on branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) without whole protein sources."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that consuming 20-40g of high-quality protein within 1-2 hours post-resistance training optimizes muscle protein synthesis. This window allows for efficient amino acid uptake and muscle repair."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client reports experiencing persistent anxiety and digestive discomfort. Considering the gut-brain axis, which of the following interventions is MOST likely to address BOTH symptoms simultaneously?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high-dose probiotic supplement with a single strain.", "Recommending a diet high in processed foods and artificial sweeteners.", "Implementing a comprehensive gut healing protocol including prebiotics, probiotics, and fermented foods.", "Suggesting only cognitive behavioral therapy without dietary changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive gut healing protocol, including prebiotics, probiotics, and fermented foods, can positively influence the gut microbiome and, subsequently, the gut-brain axis, addressing both anxiety and digestive discomfort. Studies show altered gut microbiota composition can influence mood and behavior."

            "question": "In managing autoimmune conditions nutritionally, which dietary approach is generally considered MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["A high-dose vitamin D supplementation protocol.", "A strict ketogenic diet with minimal carbohydrates.", "An elimination diet to identify potential trigger foods.", "A diet rich in gluten and processed dairy to build tolerance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet helps identify specific foods that may trigger inflammation and exacerbate autoimmune symptoms. Once triggers are identified, a personalized dietary plan can be developed."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which phase of biotransformation primarily involves conjugation reactions, making metabolites more water-soluble for excretion?",
            "options": ["Phase 0", "Phase I", "Phase II", "Phase III"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase II biotransformation involves conjugation reactions, where metabolites are combined with other molecules (e.g., glutathione, glucuronic acid) to increase their water solubility and facilitate excretion."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client has elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, but normal HDL cholesterol. Which dietary intervention is MOST likely to improve their lipid profile?",
            "options": ["Increasing saturated fat intake to improve hormone production.", "Replacing refined carbohydrates with whole grains and increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake.", "Eliminating all dietary fat to reduce cholesterol levels.", "Consuming large amounts of fructose from fruit and honey."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Replacing refined carbohydrates with whole grains and increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake can help lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while maintaining healthy HDL levels. Omega-3s have been shown to reduce triglyceride synthesis and improve lipid metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A nutrigenomic test reveals that a client has a genetic variant associated with reduced folate metabolism (e.g., MTHFR). Which of the following nutritional recommendations is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encouraging high intake of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods.", "Recommending a diet rich in folate from whole foods like leafy greens and supplementing with methylfolate.", "Advising the client to avoid all folate-containing foods.", "Suggesting high doses of vitamin B12, regardless of folate intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "For individuals with MTHFR variants, consuming folate-rich foods and supplementing with methylfolate (the active form of folate) can bypass the impaired conversion process and ensure adequate folate levels. High intakes of synthetic folic acid can potentially lead to unmetabolized folic acid in the body."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which of the following electrolytes is MOST crucial for maintaining intracellular hydration and fluid balance?",
            "options": ["Sodium", "Chloride", "Potassium", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Potassium is the primary intracellular electrolyte and plays a vital role in maintaining fluid balance within cells. Sodium, on the other hand, is the primary extracellular electrolyte."

            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "A functional medicine practitioner is using a comprehensive stool analysis with parasitology. What key information can this test provide beyond standard stool cultures?",
            "options": ["Quantification of specific gut bacteria, assessment of digestive enzymes, and detection of parasites.", "Only the identification of pathogenic bacteria.", "Only the assessment of intestinal permeability.", "Only the measurement of short-chain fatty acids."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive stool analysis provides a detailed assessment of gut health, including quantification of gut bacteria (both beneficial and pathogenic), assessment of digestive enzyme function, detection of parasites, and markers of inflammation."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 32, reports fatigue and brain fog. Her nutrigenomic report shows a variant associated with reduced glutathione production. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate nutritional strategy?",
            "options": ["Recommend a diet high in processed meats to increase protein intake.", "Suggest a diet rich in glutathione precursors like cysteine, glutamine, and glycine, and consider supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC).", "Advise her to avoid all sulfur-containing foods.", "Prescribe a high-dose iron supplement immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supporting glutathione production through dietary precursors and NAC supplementation can help improve detoxification capacity and reduce oxidative stress, addressing fatigue and brain fog in individuals with genetic predispositions to reduced glutathione synthesis."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client is preparing for a marathon and wants to optimize hydration. Which of the following strategies is MOST effective for preventing hyponatremia during the race?",
            "options": ["Drinking only plain water to avoid consuming excess calories.", "Consuming electrolyte-rich sports drinks containing sodium, potassium, and other minerals.", "Avoiding all fluids during the race to prevent gastrointestinal distress.", "Taking salt tablets without monitoring fluid intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consuming electrolyte-rich sports drinks helps replace sodium lost through sweat, preventing hyponatremia (low blood sodium) during prolonged endurance activities like marathons. Plain water can dilute sodium levels if not balanced with electrolyte intake."
