            "question": "Which of the following is NOT considered one of the '4Rs' in the gut restoration framework?",
            "options": ["Remove", "Replace", "Reinoculate", "Restructure"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 4R framework includes Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, and Repair. 'Restructure' is not part of the original protocol."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements. Based on the lesson on the gut-health connection, which initial dietary change would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Increasing intake of processed foods", "Eliminating potential food sensitivities", "Taking a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Ignoring the symptoms as they are likely temporary"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Eliminating potential food sensitivities is a crucial first step in addressing gut-related symptoms, as these sensitivities can trigger inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the prebiotics lesson, which of the following is a PRIMARY benefit of prebiotic consumption?",
            "options": ["Directly killing pathogenic bacteria", "Providing fuel for beneficial gut bacteria", "Coating the intestinal lining to prevent absorption", "Increasing stomach acid production"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prebiotics serve as food for beneficial bacteria in the gut, promoting their growth and activity. This, in turn, benefits overall gut health."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacterium infantis has been shown in clinical trials to reduce IBS symptoms such as bloating, gas, and abdominal pain, according to the lesson."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase I detoxification mainly involves oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes."

            "question": "A client following a restrictive diet reports fatigue and muscle weakness. Which nutrient deficiency is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Vitamin D", "Magnesium", "Vitamin K"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Magnesium is involved in energy production and muscle function. Deficiency can lead to fatigue and muscle weakness, making it the most likely culprit in this scenario."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve is a major communication pathway between the gut and the brain, transmitting signals related to gut function, inflammation, and stress."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, reports chronic stress, digestive issues, and poor sleep. Which of the following is the MOST comprehensive approach to restoring her gut health, based on the Restore & Rebuild plan?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high-dose probiotic supplement", "Recommending a diet high in processed foods to increase calorie intake", "Implementing stress management techniques, dietary changes, and targeted supplementation", "Suggesting a prolonged course of antibiotics to eliminate potential pathogens"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive approach involves addressing multiple factors, including stress management, dietary changes to remove irritants and add nourishing foods, and targeted supplementation to support gut repair and microbiome balance."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "According to the lesson on nutrient repletion, <span class=\"stat-highlight\">approximately 70%</span> of the immune system resides in the gut. Which nutrient plays a CRITICAL role in supporting gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) function?",
            "options": ["Vitamin A", "Vitamin E", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin K"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which is a major component of the immune system located in the gut."
