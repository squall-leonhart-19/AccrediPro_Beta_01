            "question": "Which of the following databases is MOST comprehensive for searching peer-reviewed biomedical literature?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed/MEDLINE", "Cochrane Library", "Web of Science"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed/MEDLINE, maintained by the National Library of Medicine, is the most comprehensive database for biomedical literature, indexing over 30 million citations."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A researcher reports a p-value of 0.06. Using a significance level of α = 0.05, how would you interpret this result?",
            "options": ["The result is statistically significant.", "The result is not statistically significant.", "The result is clinically significant.", "The result proves the null hypothesis is true."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is greater than the significance level of 0.05, meaning the result is not statistically significant and we fail to reject the null hypothesis."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In a randomized controlled trial, what is the primary purpose of randomization?",
            "options": ["To ensure equal sample sizes in all groups.", "To minimize selection bias and confounding variables.", "To increase the statistical power of the study.", "To make the study easier to conduct."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Randomization aims to distribute known and unknown confounding variables equally across treatment groups, reducing selection bias and improving the validity of causal inferences."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Qualitative research focuses on understanding the 'why' behind phenomena through exploration of experiences, perspectives, and meanings, often using methods like interviews and focus groups."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Hawthorne effect refers to changes in participant behavior due to the awareness of being observed, potentially influencing study outcomes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Funding bias occurs when the funding source influences the study's design, conduct, or interpretation, potentially leading to results that favor the funder's interests. This is a significant concern when the funding source has a vested interest in the outcome."
