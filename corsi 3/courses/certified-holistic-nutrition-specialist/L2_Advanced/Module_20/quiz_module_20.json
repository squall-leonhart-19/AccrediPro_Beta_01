            "question": "According to the THRIVE Framework™, which of the following is NOT a core area to assess?",
            "options": ["Thought Patterns", "Hormonal Balance", "Relationship Dynamics", "Immune Function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE Framework™ focuses on Thought Patterns, Hormonal Balance, and Immune Function as core areas. While relationship dynamics can influence health, they are not explicitly a core component of the framework."

            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client reports chronic fatigue, digestive issues, and skin problems. Which of the following assessment tools would likely provide the MOST comprehensive initial overview of potential underlying imbalances?",
            "options": ["Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "Food Sensitivity Testing", "Advanced Client History & Lifestyle Questionnaire"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "An Advanced Client History & Lifestyle Questionnaire is crucial for gathering detailed information about the client's symptoms, medical history, lifestyle factors, and potential contributing factors before selecting more specialized tests."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In Functional Blood Chemistry Analysis, elevated levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c typically indicate:",
            "options": ["Optimal blood sugar regulation", "Potential iron deficiency", "Insulin resistance or impaired glucose metabolism", "Healthy liver function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c are key indicators of insulin resistance or impaired glucose metabolism, suggesting a potential risk for pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. These markers reflect average blood sugar levels over time."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "A Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA) reveals a high calcium to magnesium ratio. This may be associated with which of the following?",
            "options": ["Adrenal fatigue", "Improved cardiovascular health", "Increased energy production", "Tendency towards muscle relaxation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A high calcium to magnesium ratio on an HTMA can indicate stress, adrenal fatigue, and potential imbalances in mineral metabolism. Magnesium is crucial for adrenal function and stress response."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary benefit of Comprehensive Stool Analysis with PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology compared to traditional stool cultures?",
            "options": ["Lower cost", "Ability to identify a wider range of pathogens and assess gut dysbiosis more accurately", "Faster turnaround time", "Improved sensitivity for detecting parasites only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive Stool Analysis with PCR technology offers enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying a broader spectrum of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites) and assessing the overall balance of the gut microbiome, providing a more complete picture of gut health."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A client's food sensitivity test reveals high reactivity to gluten and dairy. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminate gluten and dairy for life", "Rotate gluten and dairy consumption every 4 days", "Temporarily eliminate gluten and dairy, while addressing gut health and other contributing factors", "Continue consuming gluten and dairy in moderation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A temporary elimination of reactive foods (gluten and dairy in this case), alongside addressing underlying gut health issues, inflammation, and other contributing factors, is the most appropriate initial step. Reintroduction should be guided by symptom monitoring and further assessment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "During a physical assessment, you observe that a client has a consistently pale complexion, even after moderate exertion. This observation might suggest:",
            "options": ["Optimal hydration", "Potential iron deficiency or anemia", "Healthy liver function", "Adequate sun exposure"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A pale complexion can be an indicator of iron deficiency or anemia, as reduced hemoglobin levels affect skin color. Further investigation with blood tests is warranted to confirm this suspicion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, presents with fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. Her client history reveals a history of chronic stress and a diet high in processed foods. Functional blood chemistry shows elevated hs-CRP and low Vitamin D. A comprehensive stool analysis indicates gut dysbiosis. Based on this information, which assessment should be prioritized FIRST for intervention?",
            "options": ["Food Sensitivity Testing", "Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA)", "Gut dysbiosis (Comprehensive Stool Analysis)", "Vitamin D deficiency (Functional Blood Chemistry)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all findings are relevant, gut dysbiosis is often a foundational issue that can contribute to inflammation (elevated hs-CRP), nutrient deficiencies (low Vitamin D), and systemic symptoms like fatigue and brain fog. Addressing gut health first can have a cascading positive effect."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios BEST exemplifies the importance of considering individual variability when interpreting assessment results?",
            "options": ["Using the same reference ranges for all clients regardless of age or gender", "Ignoring client symptoms if lab results are within normal reference ranges", "Adjusting interpretation based on a client's age, gender, genetics, lifestyle, and medical history", "Relying solely on lab results without considering client history"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individual variability is paramount. Reference ranges are population-based, and optimal values can vary significantly based on individual factors. A holistic approach considers the client's unique circumstances to interpret results accurately."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "You are reviewing a client's assessment data and notice conflicting results between a food sensitivity test and the client's self-reported symptoms after consuming certain foods. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Disregard the food sensitivity test results", "Rely solely on the food sensitivity test results", "Prioritize the client's self-reported symptoms and conduct an elimination diet to confirm", "Prescribe digestive enzymes to address the food sensitivities"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client symptoms are paramount. Conflicting results warrant further investigation. An elimination diet, guided by the client's self-reported symptoms, can help confirm or rule out food sensitivities, even if the initial test results are inconclusive."
