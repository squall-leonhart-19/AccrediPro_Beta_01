            "question": "According to the THRIVE framework, which aspect focuses on identifying past traumas and their impact on current health?",
            "options": ["Triggers", "History", "Restoration", "Immunity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'History' component of the THRIVE framework specifically addresses the client's past, including potential traumas, to understand their influence on present health conditions."

        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique involves analyzing specific metabolites in urine to identify imbalances in metabolic pathways?",
            "options": ["Hair Mineral Analysis", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "Organic Acids Test (OAT)", "Food Sensitivity Testing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Organic Acids Testing (OAT) assesses metabolic function by measuring organic acids in urine, providing insights into nutrient deficiencies, detoxification capacity, and neurotransmitter metabolism."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In prioritizing interventions, addressing root causes over managing symptoms is crucial. Which of the following best exemplifies addressing the root cause of persistent fatigue?",
            "options": ["Taking a daily multivitamin", "Increasing caffeine intake", "Addressing gut dysbiosis through targeted dietary changes and supplementation", "Getting 8 hours of sleep per night"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gut dysbiosis can lead to nutrient malabsorption and inflammation, contributing to fatigue. Addressing the gut microbiome directly targets a potential root cause rather than just masking the symptom."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated homocysteine levels. Which nutrient is MOST directly indicated for supporting homocysteine metabolism?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin B12", "Vitamin A"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12, along with folate and B6, is crucial for the methylation cycle and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Deficiencies in these B vitamins can lead to elevated homocysteine."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle interventions is MOST directly associated with improved vagal tone and parasympathetic nervous system activation?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Regular meditation and deep breathing exercises", "Limiting screen time before bed", "Following a strict ketogenic diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meditation and deep breathing exercises have been shown to stimulate the vagus nerve, promoting relaxation and reducing stress by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. Studies show a significant increase in heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of vagal tone, with consistent practice."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "During treatment plan monitoring, a client reports feeling overwhelmed by the number of dietary changes. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Insist they adhere strictly to the plan for optimal results.", "Re-evaluate the plan and prioritize the most impactful changes, implementing them gradually.", "Suggest they seek a different practitioner who may have a simpler approach.", "Tell them that feeling overwhelmed is normal and will pass with time."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client adherence is key. Re-evaluating and prioritizing changes allows for a more manageable and sustainable approach, increasing the likelihood of long-term success. Gradual implementation reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "A client insists on receiving a specific high-dose supplement regimen they found online, despite your professional assessment indicating it's unnecessary and potentially harmful. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Provide the supplements as requested to maintain client satisfaction.", "Clearly explain the potential risks and lack of benefit, and refuse to prescribe the regimen.", "Prescribe a slightly lower dose to appease the client while minimizing harm.", "Suggest they consult with another practitioner who may be more willing to prescribe the regimen."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires prioritizing client safety and well-being. Providing unnecessary or harmful treatments violates this principle. Openly communicating the risks and refusing to prescribe is the most ethical approach."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues. A comprehensive stool analysis reveals significant dysbiosis with an overgrowth of Candida albicans. Which dietary intervention would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "A diet rich in fermented foods and probiotics", "A low-carbohydrate diet, eliminating refined sugars and processed foods", "A strict vegan diet with plenty of legumes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Candida overgrowth thrives on sugar and refined carbohydrates. A low-carbohydrate diet helps to starve the Candida and reduce its proliferation in the gut. Addressing the overgrowth is crucial for resolving the client's symptoms."

            "options": ["Food Sensitivity Testing", "Hair Mineral Analysis", "Genetic Testing for MTHFR", "Comprehensive Urine Element Analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive Urine Element Analysis (CUEA), often performed as a provoked or unprovoked test, helps to assess the body's toxic burden and ability to excrete heavy metals and other environmental toxins. This can offer insights into detoxification capacity and potential needs for support."

            "id": "q21_10",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety and insomnia after starting a new supplement regimen. What is the MOST appropriate first step in addressing this issue?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all supplements.", "Reduce the dosage of each supplement by half.", "Investigate potential interactions between the supplements or individual sensitivities.", "Recommend an anti-anxiety medication to counteract the side effects."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adverse reactions to supplements are common. Investigating potential interactions or sensitivities is crucial to identify the causative agent and determine the best course of action. It is important to avoid jumping to conclusions before understanding the whole picture."
