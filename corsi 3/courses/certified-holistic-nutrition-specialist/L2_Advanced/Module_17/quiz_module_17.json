            "question": "A client presents with both IBS and anxiety. Which nutritional intervention addresses both conditions simultaneously, according to research discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["A high-FODMAP diet to promote gut bacteria diversity.", "Limiting all fiber intake to reduce gut irritation.", "A diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and soluble fiber, alongside probiotic supplementation.", "Eliminating all dairy and gluten regardless of sensitivity testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids and soluble fiber can improve both gut health and reduce anxiety symptoms. Probiotics can also positively impact the gut-brain axis, addressing both conditions simultaneously."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small, frequent meals of bland foods like toast, crackers, or ginger ale are often best tolerated during chemotherapy due to their ease of digestion and reduced potential to trigger nausea."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-residue diet reduces the amount of undigested material in the colon, giving the inflamed bowel a chance to rest and heal during a Crohn's flare-up."
