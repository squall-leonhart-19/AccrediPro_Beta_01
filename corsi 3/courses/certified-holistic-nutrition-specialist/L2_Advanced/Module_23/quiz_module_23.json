            "options": ["It primarily focuses on the removal of all bacteria from the gut.", "It involves 3 steps: Remove, Replace, Reinoculate.", "It systematically addresses gut health by removing irritants, replacing deficiencies, reinoculating with beneficial bacteria, repairing the gut lining, and rebalancing lifestyle factors.", "It's an outdated protocol replaced by simpler methods."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 5R Protocol is a comprehensive approach addressing various aspects of gut health: Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, Repair, and Rebalance. It doesn't aim to eliminate all bacteria and is still a relevant protocol."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle detoxification is generally preferred initially, especially with heavy metal concerns, to avoid overwhelming the body. Supporting the liver and lymphatic system facilitates natural detoxification pathways. Aggressive chelation should only be considered under strict medical supervision after initial support."
