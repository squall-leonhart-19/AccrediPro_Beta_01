            "question": "A 52-year-old female client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis presents with persistent fatigue despite thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Which nutritional intervention is MOST likely to address her fatigue based on current research?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to a ketogenic diet.", "Elimination of gluten and dairy from the diet.", "High-dose iodine supplementation.", "Intermittent fasting with a 16-hour eating window."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that eliminating gluten and dairy can reduce thyroid antibody levels and improve symptoms like fatigue in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly those with concurrent celiac disease or lactose intolerance. High-dose iodine can exacerbate Hashimoto's, and ketogenic diets may not be suitable for all individuals with thyroid conditions. Intermittent fasting, while potentially beneficial for some, requires careful monitoring in individuals with autoimmune conditions."

            "question": "A 45-year-old male client with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD has elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST). Which dietary modification is MOST crucial for improving liver health and reducing liver fat accumulation?",
            "options": ["Increasing saturated fat intake to promote satiety.", "Replacing refined carbohydrates with complex carbohydrates and increasing fiber intake.", "Consuming large amounts of fruit juice for antioxidant benefits.", "Decreasing protein intake to reduce liver workload."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Replacing refined carbohydrates with complex carbohydrates and increasing fiber intake helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce hepatic lipogenesis (fat production in the liver). Studies show that diets high in refined carbs and sugars contribute to NAFLD progression. Saturated fat should be limited, and excessive fruit juice consumption can worsen NAFLD due to high fructose content. Adequate protein intake is essential for liver function."

            "question": "An 80-year-old client with Alzheimer's disease is experiencing rapid cognitive decline. Based on research related to the MIND diet, which food group should be emphasized to potentially slow cognitive decline?",
            "options": ["Red meat and processed foods.", "Butter and margarine.", "Green leafy vegetables and berries.", "Cheese and fried foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The MIND diet emphasizes green leafy vegetables and berries, which are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that may protect against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Red meat, processed foods, butter, margarine, cheese, and fried foods are discouraged due to their potential negative impact on brain health."

            "question": "A 30-year-old female client with Crohn's disease is experiencing a flare-up with symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Which dietary approach is MOST appropriate during this acute phase?",
            "options": ["A high-fiber diet to promote bowel regularity.", "A low-residue diet to reduce bowel irritation.", "A diet rich in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) to support gut microbiome diversity.", "A diet exclusively consisting of raw vegetables and fruits."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "During a Crohn's disease flare-up, a low-residue diet (low in fiber, seeds, and skins) is recommended to reduce bowel irritation and allow the gut to heal. High-fiber diets and FODMAPs can exacerbate symptoms during a flare. While raw vegetables and fruits are generally healthy, they may be difficult to digest during an acute phase."

            "question": "A 60-year-old male client with a history of myocardial infarction has elevated LDL cholesterol despite statin therapy. Which of the following dietary interventions is MOST likely to further reduce LDL cholesterol?",
            "options": ["Increasing intake of saturated fats from animal sources.", "Incorporating plant sterols and stanols into the diet.", "Eliminating all sources of dietary cholesterol.", "Consuming large amounts of refined carbohydrates."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Plant sterols and stanols are known to inhibit cholesterol absorption in the gut, leading to a reduction in LDL cholesterol levels. Saturated fats increase LDL cholesterol. While dietary cholesterol has a smaller impact than saturated fat, it's still important to moderate intake. Refined carbohydrates can negatively impact lipid profiles."

            "question": "A 5-year-old child undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia is experiencing significant nausea and loss of appetite. Which nutritional strategy is MOST appropriate to help manage these side effects?",
            "options": ["Force-feeding the child to ensure adequate calorie intake.", "Offering small, frequent meals of bland foods.", "Restricting fluid intake to minimize nausea.", "Providing only liquid nutritional supplements."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Small, frequent meals of bland foods are often better tolerated by children experiencing nausea and loss of appetite due to chemotherapy. Force-feeding can be traumatic. While fluid intake is important, it should be managed to avoid exacerbating nausea. Liquid supplements can be helpful, but a variety of foods should be offered if possible."

            "question": "A 75-year-old female client with osteoporosis is concerned about bone health. Which nutrient is MOST critical to emphasize in her diet, alongside adequate vitamin D and weight-bearing exercise?",
            "options": ["Iron.", "Vitamin C.", "Calcium.", "Sodium."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calcium is a primary component of bone, and adequate intake is essential for maintaining bone density and reducing the risk of fractures in individuals with osteoporosis. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption. While other nutrients are important for overall health, calcium is the most critical for bone health in this context."

            "question": "A 28-year-old female client with PCOS is struggling with insulin resistance and weight gain. Based on current research, which macronutrient ratio is MOST likely to improve insulin sensitivity and support weight management?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.", "High-protein, moderate-carbohydrate diet.", "High-fat, low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet.", "Balanced macronutrient diet with a focus on whole, unprocessed foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A balanced macronutrient diet with a focus on whole, unprocessed foods is generally recommended for PCOS to improve insulin sensitivity and support weight management. While specific macronutrient ratios may vary depending on individual needs, prioritizing whole foods, managing carbohydrate intake, and ensuring adequate protein and healthy fats are key. Ketogenic diets can be effective for some, but require careful monitoring. High-carbohydrate diets are generally not recommended due to the insulin resistance associated with PCOS."

            "question": "A 6-year-old child with multiple food allergies (dairy, eggs, nuts) is experiencing failure to thrive. What is the MOST important initial step to address this issue?",
            "options": ["Immediately introducing small amounts of allergenic foods to build tolerance.", "Consulting with a registered dietitian or nutritionist specializing in pediatric allergies.", "Providing only hypoallergenic formula or elemental diet.", "Ignoring the allergies and focusing on increasing calorie intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consulting with a registered dietitian or nutritionist specializing in pediatric allergies is crucial to assess the child's nutritional needs, identify potential nutrient deficiencies, and develop a safe and effective meal plan that avoids allergens while ensuring adequate growth and development. Introducing allergenic foods without proper guidance can be dangerous. Hypoallergenic formulas may be necessary, but a comprehensive assessment is needed first. Ignoring allergies is never appropriate."

            "question": "A 70-year-old male client recovering from prostate cancer surgery is experiencing sarcopenia. Which dietary strategy is MOST likely to help him regain muscle mass and strength?",
            "options": ["Limiting protein intake to reduce kidney strain.", "Consuming a diet very high in simple carbohydrates.", "Ensuring adequate protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight) combined with resistance exercise.", "Focusing solely on calorie intake, regardless of macronutrient composition."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adequate protein intake (1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight) combined with resistance exercise is essential for stimulating muscle protein synthesis and combating sarcopenia. Limiting protein intake can worsen sarcopenia. Simple carbohydrates do not contribute to muscle building. While calorie intake is important, the focus should be on adequate protein to support muscle growth."
