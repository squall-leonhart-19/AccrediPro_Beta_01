            "question": "In the initial triage of a patient presenting with severe malnutrition, which of the following is the MOST critical immediate assessment?",
            "options": ["Detailed dietary history", "Assessment of fluid and electrolyte balance", "Skinfold thickness measurements", "Hair mineral analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing fluid and electrolyte balance is paramount to prevent life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and neurological dysfunction in severely malnourished individuals. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are common and require immediate correction."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A patient with a BMI of 14 presents with signs of refeeding syndrome after initiating nutritional support. Which electrolyte abnormality is MOST commonly associated with this condition?",
            "options": ["Hypernatremia", "Hypercalcemia", "Hypophosphatemia", "Hyperkalemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hypophosphatemia is a hallmark of refeeding syndrome. As glucose and insulin levels rise during refeeding, phosphate is driven intracellularly, leading to a rapid drop in serum phosphate levels, which can cause cardiac and respiratory failure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY goal of nutritional intervention in a patient with severe acute pancreatitis?",
            "options": ["To provide immediate enteral nutrition to prevent muscle wasting", "To minimize pancreatic stimulation", "To maximize fat absorption", "To rapidly restore pre-illness weight"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to minimize pancreatic stimulation to reduce inflammation and pain. This is typically achieved by initially providing nutrition via a route that bypasses the pancreas, such as parenteral nutrition or jejunal feeding."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client with severe Crohn's disease is experiencing significant malabsorption. Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST appropriate to improve nutrient absorption?",
            "options": ["Increase fiber intake", "Implement a low-FODMAP diet", "Increase intake of long-chain triglycerides", "Consume large, infrequent meals"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet can help reduce gas, bloating, and diarrhea, which are common in Crohn's disease and contribute to malabsorption. Reducing fermentable carbohydrates decreases osmotic load and bacterial fermentation in the gut."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In a patient with a severe food allergy and anaphylaxis history, what is the MOST appropriate initial step when introducing new foods during an elimination diet?",
            "options": ["Introduce multiple new foods simultaneously to speed up the process", "Administer an antihistamine prophylactically", "Introduce a single new food in a very small amount and monitor for reactions", "Completely avoid all potentially allergenic foods indefinitely"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Introducing a single new food in a very small amount and carefully monitoring for any adverse reactions is crucial to identify triggers safely. This minimizes the risk of severe allergic reactions and allows for accurate identification of problematic foods."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is experiencing dysphagia. What is the MOST appropriate initial dietary modification to manage this?",
            "options": ["Providing thin liquids", "Encouraging large bites of solid food", "Modifying food textures to a puree or mechanically altered diet", "Restricting fluid intake to prevent aspiration"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modifying food textures to a puree or mechanically altered diet makes swallowing easier and reduces the risk of aspiration in patients with dysphagia due to ALS. Thin liquids are often difficult to control and increase aspiration risk."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "In end-of-life care, what is the PRIMARY ethical consideration regarding nutritional support?",
            "options": ["Prolonging life at all costs", "Honoring the patient's wishes and values", "Minimizing the burden on caregivers", "Reducing hospital costs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary ethical consideration is respecting the patient's autonomy and values. This includes honoring their wishes regarding nutritional support, even if it means withholding or withdrawing nutrition to alleviate suffering and improve quality of life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "A client with a history of anorexia nervosa is being re-fed. Their phosphorus levels drop to 1.8 mg/dL. What is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue re-feeding at the same rate", "Immediately stop re-feeding", "Reduce carbohydrate intake and supplement phosphorus", "Increase protein intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A phosphorus level of 1.8 mg/dL is indicative of hypophosphatemia, a key sign of refeeding syndrome. Reducing carbohydrate intake helps to slow the insulin response that drives phosphorus intracellularly, and phosphorus supplementation is essential to correct the deficiency."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A 65-year-old client is admitted to the ICU with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Which route of nutrition is generally preferred in the early stages, assuming the gut is functional?",
            "options": ["Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)", "Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN)", "Enteral Nutrition (EN)", "Intravenous fluids only"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Enteral nutrition (EN) is generally preferred in the early stages of critical illness, assuming the gut is functional. EN helps to maintain gut integrity, reduce the risk of bacterial translocation, and modulate the inflammatory response, which are all crucial in sepsis and ARDS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "Using the THRIVE framework, which element focuses on the client's individual values, beliefs, and cultural background in relation to their nutritional needs?",
            "options": ["Triage", "Holistic Assessment", "Restoration", "Implementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Holistic Assessment' component of the THRIVE framework emphasizes understanding the client's unique values, beliefs, cultural background, and personal preferences. This comprehensive approach ensures that nutritional interventions are tailored to the individual and are more likely to be successful and sustainable."
