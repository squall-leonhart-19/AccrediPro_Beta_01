            "question": "Which of the following is a core principle of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) most relevant to fertility coaching?",
            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring to eliminate negative thoughts.", "Experiential avoidance as a primary coping mechanism.", "Psychological flexibility in the face of difficult emotions.", "Strict adherence to personal values, regardless of context."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ACT emphasizes psychological flexibility, allowing clients to accept difficult emotions and commit to actions aligned with their values, despite those emotions. A 2018 study in the Journal of Psychosomatic Obstetrics & Gynecology showed ACT's effectiveness in improving emotional well-being during fertility treatment."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In narrative therapy, externalizing the 'fertility struggle' means:",
            "options": ["Blaming external factors for infertility.", "Separating the client's identity from the problem of infertility.", "Ignoring the medical aspects of infertility.", "Focusing solely on the partner's role in the fertility journey."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing helps clients see the problem as separate from themselves, reducing self-blame and fostering a sense of agency. White & Epston (1990) outlined this technique as central to narrative therapy."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, age 34, expresses feeling like a 'failure' because she hasn't conceived. Using cognitive restructuring, which question would be MOST appropriate to challenge this thought?",
            "options": ["'Have you considered adoption?'", "'Is there any evidence that you are inherently a failure as a person?'", "'Are you sure you want to be a parent?'", "'Have you tried changing your diet?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring aims to identify and challenge maladaptive thoughts. Asking if there's evidence to support the 'failure' belief directly addresses the thought's validity. This is based on Beck's cognitive model (Beck, 1979)."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of behavioral activation in the context of fertility challenges?",
            "options": ["To eliminate all negative emotions associated with infertility.", "To increase engagement in activities that provide a sense of pleasure and accomplishment.", "To isolate oneself from triggering social situations.", "To solely focus on medical interventions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Behavioral activation combats the withdrawal and inactivity often associated with depression and stress by encouraging engagement in rewarding activities. A study by Hopko et al. (1998) demonstrated its effectiveness in treating depression."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visualizing the body as supportive can enhance a sense of agency and reduce anxiety, promoting a more positive mindset during IVF. Domar et al. (2000) found that mind/body interventions improved IVF success rates."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Active listening involves paying attention, showing that you are hearing what is said, and providing feedback. It's fundamental for healthy communication. Gottman's research (Gottman, 1994) highlights the importance of effective communication in relationships."
