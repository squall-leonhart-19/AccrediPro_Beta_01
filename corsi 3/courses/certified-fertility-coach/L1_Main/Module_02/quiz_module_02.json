            "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for the maturation of follicles in the ovaries?",
            "options": ["Luteinizing Hormone (LH)", "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)", "Progesterone", "Estrogen"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FSH stimulates the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, which is essential for ovulation."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client's semen analysis reveals a sperm concentration of 10 million/mL. How would you interpret this result based on WHO guidelines?",
            "options": ["Normal", "Mild Oligozoospermia", "Moderate Oligozoospermia", "Severe Oligozoospermia"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to WHO standards, a sperm concentration between 10-15 million/mL indicates moderate oligozoospermia (low sperm count)."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which cervical mucus characteristic is MOST indicative of ovulation?",
            "options": ["Thick and sticky", "Absent", "Clear and stretchy (egg-white consistency)", "Yellow and creamy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clear, stretchy cervical mucus, resembling egg whites, is a sign of high estrogen levels and impending ovulation."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "According to the Nurses’ Health Study, what dietary factor has been MOST consistently linked to improved fertility in women?",
            "options": ["High intake of processed foods", "High intake of trans fats", "Increased consumption of whole grains and plant-based protein", "Low intake of iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Nurses' Health Study has shown that diets rich in whole grains, plant-based proteins, and healthy fats are associated with improved fertility outcomes."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) involves the direct injection of a single sperm into an egg?",
            "options": ["In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)", "Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)", "Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT)", "Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ICSI involves injecting a single sperm directly into the cytoplasm of an egg to facilitate fertilization, typically used in cases of male factor infertility."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) primarily works by:",
            "options": ["Directly stimulating the ovaries to produce eggs.", "Blocking estrogen receptors, leading to increased FSH production.", "Thinning cervical mucus.", "Increasing progesterone levels."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that blocks estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to increased FSH and LH secretion."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A 38-year-old client, Sarah, who has a child from a previous relationship, has experienced two miscarriages in the past year while trying to conceive with her current partner. This is MOST likely classified as:",
            "options": ["Primary Infertility", "Secondary Infertility and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss", "Unexplained Infertility", "Age-Related Infertility Only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah's case fits the definition of secondary infertility (having conceived before but experiencing difficulty conceiving again) and recurrent pregnancy loss (two or more miscarriages)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which of the following complementary therapies has shown some evidence for improving sperm motility?",
            "options": ["Acupuncture", "Yoga", "Herbal supplements like Tribulus terrestris", "Meditation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Some studies suggest that acupuncture may improve sperm motility and concentration by increasing blood flow and reducing oxidative stress. However, more research is needed."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client reports using a fertility awareness method (FAM) and consistently observes a shorter luteal phase (less than 10 days). What hormonal imbalance might you suspect?",
            "options": ["High Estrogen", "Low FSH", "Low Progesterone", "High LH"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A short luteal phase is often indicative of insufficient progesterone production after ovulation, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining for implantation."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Based on a case study presented in the lesson, a client implemented stress reduction techniques (mindfulness and yoga) and improved their IVF success rate from 20% to 45%. This improvement is MOST likely attributed to:",
            "options": ["Direct impact of yoga on egg quality.", "Reduced cortisol levels improving endometrial receptivity.", "Increased FSH production due to mindfulness.", "Changes in sperm DNA fragmentation caused by yoga."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress reduction techniques like mindfulness and yoga can lower cortisol levels, potentially improving endometrial receptivity and increasing the chances of successful implantation during IVF."
