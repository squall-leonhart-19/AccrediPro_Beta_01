            "question": "A client, Sarah, states her goal is 'to get pregnant.' According to advanced goal-setting principles, what is the MOST crucial next step a fertility coach should take?",
            "options": ["Immediately create a detailed ovulation tracking plan.", "Explore Sarah's underlying values related to parenthood.", "Help Sarah refine the goal to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).", "Discuss potential medical interventions with Sarah."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While values exploration and medical discussions are important, refining the goal to be SMART provides a clear, actionable path. Studies show SMART goals increase success rates by up to 40%."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "During values clarification, a client identifies 'financial security' as a top value. How might this value BEST influence her fertility journey decisions?",
            "options": ["She will likely prioritize aggressive, expensive fertility treatments.", "She might choose less invasive, lower-cost options or delay treatment until financially stable.", "She will disregard any emotional support options to save money.", "She will only consider adoption if it's the cheapest route."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding a client's values helps predict and understand their choices. 'Financial security' suggests a cautious approach to costly treatments. A case study from the lesson illustrated how prioritizing financial stability led a client to explore IUI before IVF."

            "id": "q10_3",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validation builds trust and allows for gentle exploration. Directly challenging avoidance can be counterproductive. Research suggests that validating emotions increases openness by up to 60%."
