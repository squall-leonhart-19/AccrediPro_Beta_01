            "question": "In the context of advanced goal setting for fertility clients, which of the following SMART criteria is MOST often overlooked, leading to decreased client success?",
            "options": ["Specific", "Measurable", "Achievable", "Time-bound"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all SMART criteria are important, 'Achievable' is frequently overlooked in fertility coaching. Setting unrealistically high or rapid goals can lead to discouragement and hinder progress, especially given the emotional and physical challenges inherent in fertility journeys. A 2021 study in the 'Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics' highlighted the negative impact of unachievable goals on IVF success rates."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, expresses a conflict between her deeply held religious values and the use of certain assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Which ethical principle should guide your coaching approach in this situation?",
            "options": ["Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Autonomy", "Justice"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Autonomy, the client's right to self-determination and make decisions based on their own values and beliefs, is paramount. While beneficence (acting in the client's best interest) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm) are also important, respecting Sarah's autonomy takes precedence in this ethical dilemma. Justice (fairness) is less directly relevant here."

            "question": "Which of the following communication strategies is MOST effective in addressing a client's resistance to adopting recommended lifestyle changes for fertility optimization?",
            "options": ["Directly confronting their resistance with scientific evidence.", "Using motivational interviewing techniques to explore their ambivalence.", "Providing a detailed lecture on the benefits of the changes.", "Ignoring the resistance and focusing on other areas of coaching."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motivational interviewing (MI) is a client-centered, directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. A meta-analysis published in 'Health Psychology Review' in 2016 showed that MI is significantly more effective than traditional advice-giving in promoting health behavior change."

            "question": "According to research presented in the module, what percentage of women undergoing fertility treatment report experiencing clinically significant levels of anxiety or depression?",
            "options": ["15-20%", "25-35%", "40-50%", "60-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies consistently show that a significant portion of women undergoing fertility treatment experience mental health challenges. Research indicates that approximately 40-50% report clinically significant levels of anxiety or depression, highlighting the importance of addressing stress management in fertility coaching. This statistic was cited in a 2018 review article in 'Fertility and Sterility'."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following nutrients plays the MOST critical role in oocyte quality and should be prioritized in advanced nutrition strategies for fertility optimization?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Calcium", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, are crucial for oocyte membrane fluidity and overall oocyte quality. Research, including a 2012 study in 'Human Reproduction', suggests that adequate intake of omega-3s can improve fertilization rates and embryo development. While other nutrients are important, omega-3s have a particularly strong link to oocyte health."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "You are coaching a client who is experiencing secondary infertility and expresses feelings of guilt and shame. Which of the following responses is MOST empathetic and supportive?",
            "options": ["“You shouldn’t feel guilty; many people struggle with this.”", "“It’s important to focus on the positive aspects of your existing child.”", "“I understand this is painful. It’s common to experience complex emotions like guilt and grief with secondary infertility. Let's explore those feelings.”", "“Have you considered adoption? That might be a good option.”"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and validating the client's feelings is crucial. The most empathetic response normalizes the complex emotions associated with secondary infertility and offers to explore those feelings in a supportive environment. Dismissing their feelings or suggesting alternative solutions without addressing their emotional needs is not helpful."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A fertility coach is considering offering a discount to a client who is experiencing financial hardship. Which ethical consideration is MOST relevant in this situation?",
            "options": ["Beneficence", "Justice", "Veracity", "Fidelity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Justice, in this context, refers to fairness and equitable access to services. Offering a discount to a client facing financial hardship aligns with the ethical principle of justice by promoting equitable access to fertility coaching services, even when financial resources are limited. Beneficence (doing good) is also relevant, but justice is the primary ethical consideration here."

            "options": ["Exercise, by promoting hormonal balance.", "Education, by empowering clients with knowledge.", "Emotional support, by addressing psychological well-being.", "Environment, by optimizing external factors affecting fertility."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the NESTED framework, 'E' represents Emotional support. Addressing psychological well-being is critical for managing stress, anxiety, and depression, which can significantly impact fertility outcomes. Studies show that emotional support can improve adherence to treatment plans and enhance overall well-being."

            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective strategy for a fertility coach to maintain professional boundaries with clients?",
            "options": ["Sharing personal stories to build rapport.", "Accepting gifts from clients as a token of appreciation.", "Clearly defining the scope of the coaching relationship and adhering to it.", "Providing clients with their personal phone number for easy communication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clearly defining the scope of the coaching relationship, including roles, responsibilities, and boundaries, is essential for maintaining professionalism. This prevents misunderstandings and ensures that the coaching relationship remains focused on the client's needs. Sharing personal information or accepting gifts can blur boundaries and compromise the professional relationship."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical advertising involves providing accurate, evidence-based information and avoiding misleading claims or guarantees. Promising specific outcomes or relying on anecdotal evidence is unethical and can harm potential clients by creating unrealistic expectations. Veracity (truthfulness) is a core ethical principle in marketing and advertising."
