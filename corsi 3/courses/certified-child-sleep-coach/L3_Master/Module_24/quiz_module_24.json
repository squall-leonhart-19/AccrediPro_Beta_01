            "question": "When conducting an advanced sleep assessment, which of the following is the MOST important aspect to explore beyond basic sleep history?",
            "options": ["The brand of crib mattress used.", "Parental attachment styles and co-regulation capacity.", "The child's favorite bedtime story.", "The color of the nursery walls."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced assessments delve into the parental attachment styles and co-regulation capacity as these significantly impact a child's ability to self-soothe and establish healthy sleep habits. This goes beyond basic sleep history and explores the emotional context of sleep."

            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 2), has a history of night terrors. According to the DREAM framework, which element should be your PRIMARY focus initially?",
            "options": ["Diet: Eliminating all sugar before bedtime.", "Routine: Establishing a consistent and predictable bedtime routine.", "Environment: Implementing blackout curtains and a white noise machine.", "Medical: Recommending a neurological evaluation."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Given the history of night terrors, the PRIMARY focus should be on the 'Medical' element of the DREAM framework. Night terrors can sometimes be associated with underlying medical conditions or sleep disorders that require medical evaluation and management. While the other elements are important, ruling out medical causes is paramount."

            "question": "A family with triplets is seeking sleep consulting services. Which of the following is the MOST effective strategy for addressing their sleep challenges?",
            "options": ["Treating each triplet's sleep issues in isolation.", "Implementing a rigid, identical sleep schedule for all three children.", "Focusing on parental well-being and support systems first.", "Recommending separate nurseries for each child, regardless of space constraints."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In families with multiple children, especially triplets, addressing parental well-being and support systems is crucial. As discussed in the lesson, exhausted and overwhelmed parents are less able to implement sleep strategies effectively. Prioritizing their needs can indirectly improve the children's sleep."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios represents a clear violation of ethical boundaries in child sleep consulting?",
            "options": ["Sharing general sleep tips on a public social media platform.", "Accepting a referral fee from a pediatrician.", "Promising a 100% guarantee of sleep success within a specific timeframe.", "Documenting client interactions and progress in a secure, HIPAA-compliant manner."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Promising a 100% guarantee of sleep success is unethical. Sleep consulting outcomes are influenced by numerous factors, and such guarantees are misleading and can create unrealistic expectations. While referral fees can be ethically questionable depending on local regulations, promising guaranteed results is a more direct ethical violation."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of using gentle sleep training methods compared to extinction-based approaches?",
            "options": ["Faster results and immediate sleep improvements.", "Reduced parental anxiety and a stronger parent-child bond.", "Lower risk of sleep regressions in the long term.", "Suitability for all infants, regardless of temperament."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle sleep training methods prioritize a gradual approach that minimizes parental anxiety and supports a secure parent-child bond. While results may be slower compared to extinction methods, the emphasis on responsiveness and emotional support can lead to more sustainable and positive outcomes. A meta-analysis by Douglas et al. (2023) in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry supports this."

            "question": "A 6-month-old client with a diagnosed cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is experiencing frequent night wakings. What is the MOST appropriate first step in addressing this sleep issue?",
            "options": ["Recommending a strict sleep training method like 'cry it out'.", "Collaborating with the child's pediatrician or allergist to optimize dietary management.", "Suggesting the introduction of solid foods to increase satiety.", "Advising the parents to co-sleep to provide comfort during wakings."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a child has a known medical condition like CMPA, the priority is to ensure that the condition is well-managed. Collaborating with the child's medical team is crucial to rule out any ongoing discomfort or symptoms that may be contributing to the night wakings. This aligns with the 'Medical' component of the DREAM framework."

            "question": "You are working with a family whose 4-year-old child has recently started having nightmares after starting preschool. Which of the following strategies is MOST likely to be effective?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the nightmares and hoping they will resolve on their own.", "Implementing a strict bedtime routine and limiting screen time before bed.", "Engaging in active listening and validating the child's fears and anxieties.", "Recommending a sleep medication to suppress the nightmares."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "For nightmares related to anxiety or stress (such as starting preschool), engaging in active listening and validating the child's fears is crucial. This approach helps the child feel understood and supported, which can reduce anxiety and the frequency of nightmares. Addressing the underlying emotional causes is more effective than simply suppressing the symptoms."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "A client reports that their child's sleep significantly regresses during and after family vacations. Which relapse prevention strategy would be MOST effective in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Advising the family to avoid all vacations to maintain sleep consistency.", "Developing a flexible 'vacation sleep plan' that incorporates familiar routines and comfort items.", "Instructing the family to strictly adhere to the child's regular sleep schedule, regardless of the vacation activities.", "Recommending a more intensive sleep training program before each vacation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating a flexible 'vacation sleep plan' acknowledges that vacations disrupt routines but also allows for some consistency. Incorporating familiar bedtime routines, comfort items, and a slightly adjusted (but predictable) schedule can help minimize sleep regressions during and after vacations. This approach balances the need for flexibility with the importance of maintaining healthy sleep habits."

            "question": "Which of the following marketing strategies is MOST effective for building a sustainable sleep consulting practice focused on ethical practices?",
            "options": ["Promising guaranteed results and quick fixes in all marketing materials.", "Using aggressive sales tactics to pressure potential clients into signing up.", "Showcasing client testimonials that highlight realistic outcomes and the consultant's expertise.", "Offering extremely low prices to undercut competitors, even if it compromises service quality."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Showcasing client testimonials that highlight realistic outcomes and the consultant's expertise builds trust and credibility. This approach demonstrates the value of the service without making unrealistic promises or resorting to unethical marketing tactics. A focus on ethical marketing attracts clients who value quality and expertise over quick fixes."

            "id": "q24_10",
            "question": "A 10-month-old client consistently wakes at 5:00 AM, despite an appropriate bedtime and sleep environment. What advanced assessment technique would be MOST helpful in identifying the cause of this early waking?",
            "options": ["Analyzing the child's astrological birth chart.", "Conducting a detailed review of the child's feeding schedule and daytime nap patterns.", "Measuring the child's room temperature with extreme precision.", "Ignoring the early waking and hoping it will resolve spontaneously."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A detailed review of the child's feeding schedule and daytime nap patterns is crucial. Early wakings can often be linked to inadequate daytime sleep, hunger, or an imbalance in the sleep-wake cycle. Analyzing these factors can provide valuable insights into the underlying cause of the early waking and inform appropriate interventions. This is an example of advanced assessment, going beyond the basics."
