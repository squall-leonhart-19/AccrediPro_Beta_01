            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY goal of the 'Discover & Define' phase within the DREAM Framework™?",
            "options": ["Implementing sleep training methods immediately.", "Gathering comprehensive information about the child's sleep history and family dynamics.", "Establishing a strict sleep schedule regardless of individual needs.", "Promoting independent sleep without parental involvement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Discover & Define' phase focuses on a thorough assessment of the child's sleep patterns, medical history, and the family's routines and beliefs surrounding sleep. This comprehensive understanding forms the foundation for a personalized sleep plan."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In the 'Reframe Expectations' phase, what is the MOST important aspect of parent education?",
            "options": ["Convincing parents to use only cry-it-out methods.", "Providing evidence-based information about infant sleep development and addressing common misconceptions.", "Ignoring parental concerns and implementing the sleep plan regardless.", "Focusing solely on the child's sleep without considering the parents' well-being."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Reframe Expectations' phase aims to educate parents about realistic sleep expectations, normal sleep patterns, and the impact of various factors on sleep. Addressing misconceptions is crucial for building trust and cooperation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "During the 'Establish Routines' phase, what factor is MOST crucial when crafting a personalized sleep schedule?",
            "options": ["Adhering strictly to a generic sleep schedule found online.", "Considering the child's age, developmental stage, temperament, and family lifestyle.", "Ignoring the child's natural sleep cues and enforcing a rigid bedtime.", "Prioritizing parental convenience over the child's individual needs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Personalization is key in the 'Establish Routines' phase. A successful sleep schedule must be tailored to the child's unique characteristics and the family's daily routines to ensure sustainability."

        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a gentle and responsive sleep intervention implemented during the 'Apply Strategies' phase?",
            "options": ["Leaving the child to cry alone until they fall asleep.", "Gradually fading parental presence while providing comfort and reassurance.", "Completely eliminating nighttime feedings regardless of the child's age.", "Using physical restraints to keep the child in bed."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle and responsive sleep interventions prioritize the child's emotional well-being and involve gradual changes with parental support and comfort. Gradual fading is a common technique."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "What is the primary focus of the 'Monitor & Maintain' phase in the DREAM Framework™?",
            "options": ["Ignoring any setbacks and assuming the sleep plan will always work.", "Tracking the child's sleep progress, identifying potential challenges, and making adjustments as needed.", "Blaming the parents if the sleep plan doesn't work perfectly.", "Discontinuing all support once the child is sleeping well."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Monitor & Maintain' phase is about ongoing evaluation and adaptation. Tracking progress, identifying potential issues, and making necessary adjustments are crucial for long-term success."

            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A sleep coach is designing a program for a 3-year-old with night terrors. Which phase of the DREAM Framework™ requires the MOST customization in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Discover & Define", "Reframe Expectations", "Establish Routines", "Apply Strategies"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all phases require attention, 'Apply Strategies' will need significant customization. Night terrors require specific, gentle strategies focusing on safety and prevention, such as scheduled awakenings, rather than typical sleep training techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "You're developing a sleep program. A client tells you they've tried 'everything' they found on the internet. Which phase of the DREAM Framework™ is MOST critical to address their concerns effectively?",
            "options": ["Discover & Define", "Reframe Expectations", "Establish Routines", "Monitor & Maintain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Reframe Expectations' phase is critical. The client likely has unrealistic expectations or has tried inappropriate methods. This phase allows you to educate them about evidence-based practices and address their specific concerns and misconceptions about sleep."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "According to a case study discussed in the module, a family reported a <span class=\"highlight\">70%</span> improvement in their child's sleep after consistently implementing a sleep program developed using the DREAM Framework™. This improvement was MOST directly attributed to which factor?",
            "options": ["The use of a specific sleep training method.", "The family's commitment to consistent routines and addressing underlying sleep associations.", "The child's natural ability to sleep well.", "The elimination of all screen time before bed."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While specific strategies and screen time reduction can contribute, the case study highlighted that consistent routines and addressing underlying sleep associations (e.g., feeding to sleep) were the key drivers of the significant improvement."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A parent expresses concerns about using any sleep training methods that involve crying. Which approach during the 'Apply Strategies' phase would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Insisting that cry-it-out is the only effective method.", "Exploring gentle, no-cry sleep training techniques and respecting the parent's preferences.", "Refusing to work with the family due to their unwillingness to use crying methods.", "Ignoring the parent's concerns and implementing a standard cry-it-out approach."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["The specific bedtime hour.", "The consistency of the bedtime routine.", "The sensory environment of the sleep space.", "The length of the bedtime story."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with sensory processing disorder are highly sensitive to their environment. Therefore, the sensory environment of the sleep space (e.g., lighting, sounds, textures) needs to be carefully considered and adapted to minimize sensory overload and promote relaxation."
