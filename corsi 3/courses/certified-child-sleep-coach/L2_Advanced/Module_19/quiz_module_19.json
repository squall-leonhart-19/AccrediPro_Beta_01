        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following research methodologies is considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the effectiveness of a sleep intervention?",
            "options": ["Cross-sectional study", "Cohort study", "Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)", "Case-control study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard because they use randomization to minimize bias and establish cause-and-effect relationships."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A study reports a p-value of 0.06. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The results are statistically significant.", "The results are likely due to chance.", "The sample size is too small.", "The intervention is highly effective."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 indicates that there is a 6% probability that the observed results are due to chance, which is typically not considered statistically significant (usually p < 0.05 is required)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is publication bias, and how might it affect the interpretation of research on pediatric sleep?",
            "options": ["Bias introduced by the researchers' personal beliefs.", "The tendency for journals to publish studies with positive results more often than studies with negative results.", "Bias introduced by study participants.", "The tendency for studies with large sample sizes to be more readily published."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Publication bias can lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of interventions, as studies showing no effect or negative effects may not be published, skewing the overall evidence base."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 25 studies on the effectiveness of bedtime routines for infants reported a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25) with a 95% confidence interval of [0.10, 0.40]. What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["Bedtime routines have a large and significant effect on infant sleep.", "Bedtime routines have a small but statistically significant effect on infant sleep.", "Bedtime routines have no effect on infant sleep.", "The results are inconclusive due to the wide confidence interval."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A small effect size (d=0.25) indicates a modest effect, but the confidence interval [0.10, 0.40] not crossing zero suggests that the effect is statistically significant."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a core component of good sleep hygiene?",
            "options": ["Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.", "Creating a relaxing bedtime routine.", "Using electronic devices before bed.", "Ensuring a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using electronic devices before bed is detrimental to sleep hygiene due to the blue light emitted from screens, which can suppress melatonin production."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A parent reports that their 4-year-old child consistently resists bedtime, has difficulty falling asleep, and often wakes up during the night. Based on this information, which sleep disorder is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Sleep apnea", "Night terrors", "Insomnia", "Restless Legs Syndrome"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described – bedtime resistance, difficulty falling asleep, and frequent night wakings – are characteristic of insomnia in children."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When translating research findings into practical advice for parents, what is a crucial ethical consideration?",
            "options": ["Only recommending interventions that have been proven effective in all children.", "Ensuring that parents understand the limitations of the research and the potential for individual variability.", "Guaranteeing that the intervention will solve the child's sleep problems.", "Recommending the most convenient intervention for the parents."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to inform parents about the limitations of research and the possibility of individual variability because not all children respond to interventions in the same way. Overpromising results is unethical."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the context of pediatric sleep coaching research, what is the potential impact of cultural differences on the effectiveness of sleep interventions?",
            "options": ["Cultural differences have no impact on sleep interventions.", "Sleep interventions are universally effective across all cultures.", "Cultural beliefs and practices can significantly influence parenting styles and sleep habits, potentially affecting the success of interventions.", "Cultural differences only affect parental preferences, not the child's sleep."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cultural beliefs and practices can significantly influence parenting styles and sleep habits, potentially affecting the success of interventions. Coaches need to be culturally sensitive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A sleep coach is reviewing a study that claims a new 'revolutionary' method can solve all infant sleep problems within 3 days. The study has a small sample size (n=20) and lacks a control group. What is the most appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend the method to all clients.", "Critically evaluate the study's methodology and limitations before considering its application.", "Ignore the study because it is too small.", "Assume the study is valid because it claims a revolutionary breakthrough."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to critically evaluate the study's methodology, sample size, and lack of a control group. A small study without a control group cannot make definitive claims."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a promising future direction in pediatric sleep research?",
            "options": ["Developing more restrictive sleep training methods.", "Ignoring parental preferences in sleep interventions.", "Utilizing technology to passively monitor sleep patterns and tailor interventions.", "Focusing solely on pharmacological interventions for sleep disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The use of technology for passive sleep monitoring and tailored interventions holds promise for improving sleep outcomes in children by providing personalized and data-driven approaches."
