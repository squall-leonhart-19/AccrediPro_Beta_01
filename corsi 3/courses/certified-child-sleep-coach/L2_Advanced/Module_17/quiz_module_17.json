        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "When parents present with significantly conflicting sleep training philosophies, what is the FIRST and MOST crucial step a sleep coach should take?",
            "options": ["Immediately suggest a compromise sleep plan.", "Individually assess each parent's beliefs and concerns to facilitate a unified approach.", "Side with the parent who initially sought the sleep coaching services.", "Recommend separate consultations with each parent."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing individual beliefs and concerns allows for a tailored approach that addresses the root of the conflict and promotes a unified strategy, which is more likely to be successful long-term."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A family reports consistently co-sleeping with their 18-month-old. They express a desire for the child to sleep independently but struggle with separation anxiety, particularly at bedtime. What is the MOST gentle and evidence-based approach to suggest?",
            "options": ["A strict 'cry it out' method to quickly establish independent sleep.", "Gradual withdrawal, where a parent slowly reduces their presence in the child's room over several nights.", "Immediately moving the child to their own room with no transition period.", "Ignoring the child's cries and consistently placing them back in their crib."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual withdrawal acknowledges the child's separation anxiety and provides a gentle, supportive transition to independent sleep, aligning with attachment-based approaches."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of new mothers experience postpartum depression (PPD) or postpartum anxiety (PPA)?",
            "options": ["Approximately 5%", "Approximately 10%", "Approximately 15-20%", "Approximately 30%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 15-20% of new mothers experience PPD or PPA, highlighting the importance of screening and support."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A 9-month-old who previously slept through the night is now waking multiple times, displaying increased fussiness, and attempting new motor skills like pulling to stand. This is MOST likely due to:",
            "options": ["A food allergy.", "A sleep regression related to a developmental leap.", "Teething pain.", "Inadequate daytime naps."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of sleep disruption, fussiness, and new motor skills strongly suggests a sleep regression associated with a developmental leap. These regressions are common during periods of rapid development."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client reports their 6-month-old frequently spits up after feeds and seems uncomfortable when lying flat. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Suggest adding rice cereal to the baby's bottle to thicken the formula.", "Advise elevating the head of the crib and consulting with their pediatrician regarding possible reflux.", "Recommend eliminating dairy from the mother's diet (if breastfeeding).", "Suggest switching to a hypoallergenic formula immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevating the head of the crib can help reduce reflux symptoms, and consulting with a pediatrician is crucial to rule out or manage gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) appropriately."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A family with a child exhibiting sensory processing sensitivities is struggling with bedtime routines. Which of the following environmental modifications is MOST likely to improve sleep?",
            "options": ["Using bright, stimulating nightlights.", "Playing loud, upbeat music to mask other household noises.", "Creating a dark, quiet, and cool sleep environment with minimal tactile stimulation.", "Encouraging vigorous physical activity right before bedtime."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with sensory sensitivities often benefit from a calm, predictable, and minimally stimulating sleep environment. Reducing sensory input can help promote relaxation and sleep."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "When working with a child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and sleep challenges, what is a critical consideration regarding sleep training methods?",
            "options": ["All sleep training methods are equally effective for children with ASD.", "A highly structured and consistent approach, tailored to the child's specific needs and sensory sensitivities, is crucial.", "Ignoring the child's sensory sensitivities will promote faster sleep independence.", "It's best to avoid sleep training altogether due to potential distress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with ASD often thrive on structure and predictability. A tailored approach that addresses their unique sensory needs is essential for successful sleep training."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A family is traveling across 5 time zones with their 2-year-old. What is the MOST effective strategy to minimize sleep disruption?",
            "options": ["Immediately switch the child to the new time zone upon arrival.", "Keep the child on their original time zone schedule for the entire trip.", "Gradually adjust the child's schedule to the new time zone a few days before departure.", "Avoid any naps during the travel day to ensure the child is tired at bedtime."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gradually adjusting to the new time zone before departure helps the child's body clock adapt more smoothly, reducing the impact of jet lag."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Case Study: The Miller family has a 4-year-old who refuses to sleep in their own bed after experiencing nightmares. Both parents work full-time and are exhausted. What initial recommendation best addresses the child's fear and the parents' fatigue?",
            "options": ["Suggest the child sleep in the parents' bed until the nightmares subside.", "Recommend a strict sleep schedule with no exceptions.", "Advise creating a calming bedtime routine, incorporating a 'monster spray' or dream catcher, and gradually increasing parental distance.", "Suggest consulting a child psychologist immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A calming routine and symbolic reassurance can address the child's fear, while gradually increasing parental distance supports independent sleep. This approach balances the child's needs with the parents' fatigue."

            "options": ["Distress with clothing tags or seams.", "Difficulty tolerating certain textures of food.", "Preference for very bright lights and loud noises.", "Heightened sensitivity to sounds or smells."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Individuals with sensory processing sensitivities typically AVOID bright lights and loud noises, as these can be overstimulating and distressing. They prefer dim lights and quiet environments."
