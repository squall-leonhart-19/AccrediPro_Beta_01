            "question": "A sleep coach with a background in psychology is approached by a family whose child presents with symptoms suggestive of a possible underlying medical condition contributing to sleep disturbances. What is the MOST ETHICAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Provide a detailed psychological assessment and diagnosis.", "Recommend specific sleep training techniques without consulting other professionals.", "Advise the family to consult with a pediatrician or other appropriate healthcare provider.", "Offer to treat the child's sleep issues independently, as sleep problems are often psychological."],

If the family still insists on a harmful method, the coach should consider withdrawing services."
