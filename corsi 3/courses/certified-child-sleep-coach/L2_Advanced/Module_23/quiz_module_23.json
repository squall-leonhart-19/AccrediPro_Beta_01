            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial first step when managing multiple, simultaneous sleep challenges in a child?",
            "options": ["Implementing a strict bedtime routine immediately.", "Addressing the most disruptive challenge first, regardless of its underlying cause.", "Conducting a comprehensive assessment to identify all contributing factors.", "Ignoring minor issues and focusing solely on the primary sleep problem."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive assessment is crucial to understanding the interplay of different sleep challenges and tailoring the intervention effectively. Addressing the most disruptive challenge without understanding the root causes can lead to ineffective or even counterproductive strategies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "A 14-month-old, previously sleep-trained, is now waking frequently at night and resisting naps after starting daycare. Which sleep regression trigger is MOST likely contributing to this change?",
            "options": ["Teething discomfort.", "A developmental leap in gross motor skills.", "Separation anxiety and changes in routine.", "Dietary changes due to new food exposure."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting daycare often triggers separation anxiety and disrupts a child's established routine, leading to sleep regressions. While teething or developmental leaps can also contribute, the timing strongly suggests daycare as the primary trigger in this scenario."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "In the context of advanced gentle sleep training, what does 'fading' primarily refer to?",
            "options": ["Gradually decreasing the intensity of room lighting during bedtime.", "Slowly reducing the amount of parental presence and intervention as the child learns to self-soothe.", "Phasing out specific sleep associations all at once.", "Using white noise at progressively lower volumes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fading in gentle sleep training involves gradually reducing parental involvement, allowing the child to develop independent sleep skills at their own pace. This approach aims to minimize stress and anxiety for both the child and the parents."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "You are working with parents who adhere to an attachment parenting style. They are struggling with frequent night wakings in their 2-year-old. Which gentle sleep training technique would be MOST aligned with their parenting philosophy?",
            "options": ["Controlled crying with increasing intervals.", "Scheduled awakenings to prevent full wakings.", "The 'chair method,' where you gradually move the chair further from the crib each night.", "Providing consistent comfort and reassurance while encouraging independent sleep skills through gradual fading."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Attachment parenting emphasizes responsiveness and emotional connection. Gentle sleep training techniques that involve gradual fading and consistent reassurance align best with this philosophy, as they prioritize the child's emotional needs while promoting independent sleep."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "A 9-month-old is consistently taking short, 30-minute naps. According to research presented in the module, what is the MOST likely underlying reason for this nap duration?",
            "options": ["The baby is not tired enough and needs more active playtime.", "The baby is overtired and unable to transition between sleep cycles effectively.", "The baby is experiencing a deficiency in Vitamin D.", "The baby's room is too bright, disrupting melatonin production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Short naps are often associated with babies becoming overtired. When overtired, they struggle to regulate their sleep cycles, resulting in brief naps. Ensuring appropriate wake windows and addressing potential overtiredness are key strategies for lengthening naps."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "A family is moving across the country with their 3-year-old. What is the MOST important recommendation to help minimize sleep disruptions during and after the move?",
            "options": ["Immediately enforce the child's regular sleep schedule in the new location.", "Allow the child to sleep whenever they are tired, regardless of the time of day.", "Maintain as much of the child's familiar bedtime routine and sleep environment as possible.", "Introduce a new bedtime routine to signify the change in location."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining consistency and familiarity during significant life changes like moving is crucial for minimizing sleep disruptions. Replicating the child's bedtime routine and sleep environment provides a sense of security and predictability, helping them adjust to the new surroundings."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "You are working with a child who has diagnosed Sensory Processing Disorder and exhibits tactile defensiveness. Which of the following bedding materials would be LEAST suitable for promoting restful sleep?",
            "options": ["Soft, breathable cotton sheets.", "Smooth, satin pillowcase.", "Weighted blanket with even weight distribution.", "A quilt with rough, textured patches."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Children with tactile defensiveness are highly sensitive to textures. Rough or textured fabrics can be irritating and uncomfortable, disrupting their sleep. Smooth, soft materials and weighted blankets are generally more suitable for children with sensory sensitivities."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to a case study in the module, a 5-year-old child named Lily, who was previously co-sleeping, successfully transitioned to her own bed using which advanced gentle technique?",
            "options": ["Cry it out method.", "The disappearing chair method combined with a reward chart.", "Scheduled awakenings.", "Complete extinction method."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the success of transitioning Lily from co-sleeping to her own bed using the disappearing chair method, where the parent gradually reduces their presence in the room, combined with a reward chart to positively reinforce independent sleep."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A parent tells you they have been giving their child melatonin supplements every night for the past year without consulting a pediatrician. What is your MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Advise them to continue as long as it seems to be working.", "Immediately recommend a higher dosage of melatonin for better results.", "Strongly advise them to consult with a pediatrician regarding melatonin use and potential side effects.", "Suggest they switch to a different brand of melatonin."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin supplementation in children should always be done under the guidance of a pediatrician. Long-term use without medical supervision can have potential side effects and may mask underlying sleep disorders. Recommending a consultation ensures the child's safety and well-being."

        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of using a sleep diary when addressing multiple sleep challenges simultaneously?",
            "options": ["It provides a visual representation of the child's sleep patterns, making it easier to identify trends and contributing factors.", "It automatically solves the child's sleep problems.", "It allows parents to blame external factors for their child's sleep issues.", "It eliminates the need for professional consultation."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A sleep diary is a valuable tool for tracking sleep patterns, identifying potential triggers, and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions. The visual representation of the data helps to understand the complex interplay of factors contributing to multiple sleep challenges."
