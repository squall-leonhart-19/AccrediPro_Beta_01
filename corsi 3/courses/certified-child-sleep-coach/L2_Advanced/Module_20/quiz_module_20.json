        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element to gather from a comprehensive sleep history questionnaire?",
            "options": ["Preferred bedtime stories", "Detailed meal plans for the family", "A thorough timeline of sleep-related behaviors and patterns", "The color of the child's bedroom walls"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A timeline of sleep-related behaviors and patterns provides the foundation for identifying potential sleep disruptors and establishing a baseline for intervention."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "When analyzing a sleep diary, what does a high degree of variability in bedtime and wake time MOST likely indicate?",
            "options": ["The child is naturally a 'night owl'.", "The child has excellent sleep hygiene.", "The child's sleep is likely affected by inconsistent routines or environmental factors.", "The child is likely experiencing a growth spurt."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Variability suggests a lack of entrainment to a consistent circadian rhythm, potentially due to inconsistent routines or environmental cues."

        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "During a home video analysis, you observe a child repeatedly banging their head against the crib rails before falling asleep. What is the MOST appropriate initial course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend co-sleeping to provide comfort.", "Advise the parents to ignore the behavior, as it is likely a self-soothing mechanism.", "Recommend a medical evaluation to rule out underlying medical conditions or developmental concerns.", "Suggest a stricter bedtime routine to tire the child out."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Head banging can sometimes indicate underlying medical or developmental issues, warranting a medical evaluation before implementing behavioral interventions."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which of the following medical red flags identified during the assessment process requires IMMEDIATE referral to a medical professional?",
            "options": ["Occasional snoring", "Night terrors occurring once a month", "Frequent pauses in breathing during sleep (apnea)", "Mild teeth grinding during sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Frequent pauses in breathing during sleep (apnea) are a serious medical concern that requires immediate evaluation and treatment due to potential oxygen desaturation."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A 4-year-old child consistently resists bedtime, exhibiting tantrums and refusal to stay in their room. Which developmental stage is MOST relevant to consider when assessing this behavior?",
            "options": ["Sensorimotor stage", "Preoperational stage", "Concrete operational stage", "Formal operational stage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The preoperational stage (ages 2-7) is characterized by increased independence, imagination, and also defiance, which can manifest as bedtime resistance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Parents report consistently co-sleeping with their 2-year-old child due to the child's separation anxiety. Using a co-sleeping assessment tool, you identify a high degree of parental sleep disruption. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Recommend immediate cessation of co-sleeping.", "Explore the parents' motivations for co-sleeping and assess their readiness for change, while addressing the child's separation anxiety with gentle sleep training methods.", "Suggest the parents continue co-sleeping indefinitely.", "Advise the parents to give the child melatonin to promote independent sleep."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A gradual approach that considers both parental needs and the child's emotional well-being is crucial. Addressing separation anxiety alongside gentle sleep training is more effective than abrupt changes."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "An environmental assessment checklist reveals that a child's bedroom is consistently exposed to bright light from street lamps throughout the night. What specific recommendation is MOST likely to improve the child's sleep?",
            "options": ["Increasing the child's daytime nap duration", "Using blackout curtains to create a dark sleep environment", "Introducing a white noise machine to mask the street lamp sounds", "Switching the child's bedroom to a different room in the house"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exposure to light at night can suppress melatonin production, disrupting the circadian rhythm. Blackout curtains are an effective solution."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "According to the DREAM framework (Describe, Review, Explore, Act, Maintain), what is the PRIMARY focus of the 'Review' phase when synthesizing assessment data?",
            "options": ["Implementing the sleep plan", "Identifying patterns and inconsistencies in the collected data", "Describing the child's current sleep situation", "Maintaining the sleep improvements long-term"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Review' phase involves carefully analyzing all collected data (sleep diaries, questionnaires, observations) to identify patterns, correlations, and potential root causes of sleep issues."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 6), presents with bedtime resistance and frequent night wakings. Her sleep diary shows inconsistent bedtimes (ranging from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM) and a highly stimulating pre-bedtime routine involving video games. Medical screening is clear. Based on this information, which intervention should be prioritized?",
            "options": ["Implementing a strict elimination diet.", "Establishing a consistent bedtime routine and limiting screen time before bed.", "Recommending a sleep study.", "Suggesting the child share a bed with a sibling."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The inconsistent bedtime and stimulating pre-bedtime routine are likely contributing to Sarah's sleep problems. Addressing these behavioral factors should be the initial focus."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A study showed that using a combination of sleep history questionnaires, sleep diaries, and actigraphy resulted in a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">25%</span> higher accuracy in diagnosing pediatric insomnia compared to relying solely on parental reports. What does this highlight regarding assessment tools?",
            "options": ["Parental reports are always unreliable.", "Combining multiple assessment tools provides a more comprehensive and accurate picture of a child's sleep.", "Actigraphy is the only necessary tool for sleep assessment.", "Sleep history questionnaires are the least important assessment tool."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using a multi-method approach helps to overcome the limitations of individual tools and provides a more reliable diagnosis."
