            "options": ["Publicly reprimand the parent to maintain control.", "Ignore the parent and continue with the planned agenda.", "Acknowledge the parent's concerns, address them briefly, and redirect the conversation back to the group.", "End the workshop early to avoid further disruptions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the parent's concerns validates their feelings while redirecting the conversation ensures the workshop stays on track and benefits all participants. It balances empathy with effective facilitation."
