            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defining the scope of services and disclaiming guarantees is crucial to managing client expectations and limiting liability. While the other options are important, they are secondary to clearly defining the services provided and avoiding implied guarantees of success."

            "explanation": "HIPAA primarily applies to covered entities (health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers who conduct certain financial and administrative transactions electronically). Billing an insurance company directly triggers HIPAA compliance, whereas the other scenarios may fall under other privacy regulations but not necessarily HIPAA."
