        {
            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "Which of the following data points is MOST crucial to consistently collect when monitoring a child's sleep after implementing a sleep plan?",
            "options": ["Daily mood scores", "Wake times and sleep duration", "Parent's caffeine intake", "Number of social interactions during the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wake times and sleep duration provide direct insight into the effectiveness of the sleep plan and allow for timely adjustments. While the other options can be helpful contextually, they are not as central to assessing sleep progress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "You observe a consistent pattern of early morning wakings (between 5:00 AM and 5:30 AM) in a 14-month-old, despite an established bedtime routine and appropriate total sleep duration. What is the MOST likely cause?",
            "options": ["Teething discomfort", "Hunger", "Overtiredness", "Too much daytime sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Early morning wakings are often linked to too much daytime sleep, reducing the homeostatic sleep drive overnight. Overtiredness typically leads to difficulty falling asleep or frequent night wakings, not necessarily early morning wakings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A parent reports that their 3-year-old, who was previously sleeping independently, is now consistently waking up in the middle of the night and coming to their bed. What is the BEST initial strategy to address this?",
            "options": ["Immediately bring the child back to their bed and stay until they fall asleep.", "Implement a reward chart for staying in their own bed all night.", "Gently guide the child back to their bed with minimal interaction.", "Allow the child to sleep in the parent's bed to avoid conflict."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gently guiding the child back to their bed with minimal interaction reinforces the expectation of sleeping independently without creating a negative association or long-term dependency on parental presence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the course, what percentage of parents report experiencing symptoms of burnout when dealing with persistent child sleep issues?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that a significant portion of parents, specifically 50-60%, experience burnout when faced with ongoing child sleep problems, highlighting the importance of addressing parental well-being."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "A sleep plan has been successfully implemented for a 9-month-old. To maintain long-term sleep success, what is the MOST important recommendation to provide to the parents?",
            "options": ["Strictly adhere to the exact same schedule every day, regardless of circumstances.", "Be flexible and adjust the schedule based on daily activities.", "Maintain consistency with bedtime routines and wake windows, while allowing for some flexibility.", "Discontinue all sleep routines once the child is consistently sleeping through the night."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining consistency with bedtime routines and wake windows provides a stable foundation for sleep, while allowing for some flexibility to accommodate occasional changes in schedule and activities is crucial for long-term adherence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "A parent confides that they are secretly adding rice cereal to their 4-month-old's bottle to help them sleep longer, despite your recommendation against it. What is the MOST appropriate ethical response?",
            "options": ["Immediately terminate the coaching relationship.", "Report the parent to child protective services.", "Educate the parent on the potential risks and benefits, and document the conversation.", "Ignore the information since it is the parent's choice."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While concerning, the most appropriate initial response is to educate the parent on the potential risks (choking, nutrient imbalance) and benefits (perceived increased sleep duration), and document the conversation. Prematurely stopping the relationship or reporting the parent might not be necessary unless there are other signs of neglect or harm. You should reiterate the current recommendations based on the baby's age and development."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is the BEST example of adapting a sleep plan to a changing need?",
            "options": ["Maintaining the exact same bedtime routine, even when traveling across time zones.", "Ignoring a child's increased hunger cues during a growth spurt.", "Adjusting wake windows and nap times as a baby transitions from three naps to two.", "Continuing to use a sleep training method that is causing significant distress to the child."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting wake windows and nap times during a nap transition is a direct example of adapting a sleep plan to a child's developmental needs. The other options demonstrate a lack of responsiveness to changing circumstances."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "When analyzing sleep data, a consistent increase in sleep latency (time to fall asleep) could indicate which of the following?",
            "options": ["The child is getting too much sleep.", "The child is becoming overtired.", "The child is experiencing separation anxiety.", "The child is not getting enough physical activity during the day."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased sleep latency often indicates that a child is overtired. When a child is overtired, their body releases cortisol, a stress hormone, which can make it more difficult for them to fall asleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A client is experiencing significant parental burnout. What is the FIRST and MOST important step you should recommend?",
            "options": ["Suggest they hire a night nanny immediately.", "Encourage them to prioritize self-care activities, even in small increments.", "Advise them to completely stop all sleep training efforts.", "Refer them to a sleep specialist for medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing self-care, even in small increments, is the most important first step. It helps replenish their emotional resources and improves their ability to cope with the challenges of parenting and sleep training. Other options may be considered later, but self-care is foundational."

            "question": "As a Certified Child Sleep Coach™, which of the following falls OUTSIDE your scope of practice?",
            "options": ["Providing education on safe sleep practices.", "Developing a personalized sleep plan based on a child's developmental stage.", "Diagnosing and treating underlying medical conditions that may be affecting sleep.", "Offering strategies to address bedtime resistance and night wakings."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing and treating underlying medical conditions is outside the scope of practice for a Certified Child Sleep Coach™. This requires medical expertise and should be handled by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or sleep specialist."
