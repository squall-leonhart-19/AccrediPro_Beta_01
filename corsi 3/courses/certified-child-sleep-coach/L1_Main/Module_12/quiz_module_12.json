            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which of the following parental beliefs is MOST likely to hinder successful sleep coaching, according to research on parental anxiety?",
            "options": ["\"My child needs to fall asleep independently.\"", "\"Sleep training is inherently harmful to my child's attachment.\"", "\"A consistent bedtime routine is crucial.\"", "\"My child's sleep is my responsibility.\""],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies show that parents with strong beliefs that sleep training harms attachment are less likely to adhere to the plan, leading to inconsistent implementation and reduced success."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A 2-year-old client consistently wakes at 5:00 AM, despite an appropriate bedtime. Which troubleshooting strategy is LEAST likely to be effective initially?",
            "options": ["Gradually shifting bedtime later by 15 minutes every few days.", "Ensuring the room is dark and cool.", "Offering a small snack immediately upon waking.", "Using a 'wake to sleep' technique 30 minutes before the usual wake time."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Offering a snack upon waking reinforces the early rising. Addressing environmental factors and bedtime adjustments are more likely to resolve the issue initially."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When supporting a family with a newborn and a 3-year-old, what is the MOST important initial step to ensure successful sleep for both children?",
            "options": ["Putting both children on the exact same sleep schedule.", "Focusing exclusively on the newborn's sleep needs initially.", "Establishing realistic expectations and routines that accommodate both children's developmental stages.", "Ignoring the 3-year-old's sleep to prioritize the newborn."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Setting realistic expectations and tailoring routines to each child's developmental stage is crucial for minimizing disruption and maximizing sleep quality for both children."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A child with sensory processing disorder exhibits extreme resistance to swaddling. What is the MOST appropriate alternative strategy to promote sleep?",
            "options": ["Forcing the swaddle until the child gets used to it.", "Using a weighted blanket or sleep sack with parental supervision.", "Completely eliminating any form of sleep sack or blanket.", "Using tight-fitting clothing to simulate the feeling of being swaddled."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Weighted blankets or sleep sacks can provide proprioceptive input that is calming for some children with sensory sensitivities, but should always be used with supervision."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "During a sleep regression, a 10-month-old who previously slept through the night is now waking multiple times. Parents report the child is pulling to stand in the crib. What is the BEST initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Immediately transitioning the child to a toddler bed.", "Reassuring parents that this is a normal developmental phase and to remain consistent with their established sleep plan.", "Starting cry-it-out immediately.", "Adding a crib bumper to prevent the child from pulling to stand."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Remaining consistent with the existing sleep plan is crucial during a regression. This is a common developmental phase related to new motor skills."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A toddler is resisting their afternoon nap, and the parents suspect they are ready for a nap transition. What is the MOST appropriate initial strategy to assess nap readiness?",
            "options": ["Immediately eliminating the nap altogether.", "Gradually shortening the nap by 15 minutes each day.", "Moving bedtime earlier to compensate for the lost nap.", "Observing the child's behavior for signs of overtiredness and adjusting the nap schedule accordingly."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Careful observation of the child's behavior and signs of overtiredness is crucial for determining nap readiness and guiding schedule adjustments."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaboration with the child's healthcare team and a highly individualized approach are essential due to the diverse needs and sensitivities of children with ASD."

            "question": "A sleep coach is asked by a client to prescribe medication to help their child sleep. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Contacting the child's pediatrician to request a prescription on the client's behalf.", "Prescribing an over-the-counter sleep aid.", "Explaining that prescribing medication is outside the scope of practice for a sleep coach and referring them to a qualified healthcare professional.", "Providing information about different sleep medications."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prescribing medication is outside the scope of practice for a sleep coach. Referring the client to a qualified healthcare professional is the ethical and appropriate response."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A 15-month-old client is experiencing frequent night wakings. The parents report they are co-sleeping but want to transition to independent sleep. They are using a pacifier for sleep. According to the lessons, what is the MOST evidence-based initial approach?",
            "options": ["Abruptly removing the pacifier and implementing cry-it-out.", "Gradually reducing the amount of time the pacifier is offered during the night.", "Moving the child to their own room and implementing a gentle sleep training method, while keeping the pacifier.", "Continuing co-sleeping until the child is older and more ready for independent sleep."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle sleep training methods combined with moving the child to their own sleep space are often more effective than abrupt changes, especially when a comfort object like a pacifier is involved."

            "question": "A sleep coach is working with a family who has a 6-year-old and a 4-year-old sharing a room. The 6-year-old is consistently disrupting the 4-year-old's sleep. What strategy is LEAST likely to be effective in the long term?",
            "options": ["Establishing clear bedtime rules and expectations for both children.", "Separating the children into different rooms, if feasible.", "Using a white noise machine to mask disturbances.", "Punishing the 6-year-old for waking the 4-year-old."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Punishment is generally ineffective and can create negative associations with bedtime. Positive reinforcement and clear expectations are more beneficial."
