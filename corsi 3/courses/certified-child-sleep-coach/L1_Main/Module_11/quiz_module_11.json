            "question": "A 14-month-old, previously sleep-trained, is now waking frequently at night and resisting naps after a recent cold. Which of the following is the MOST likely explanation, considering the information presented in the 'Sleep Regressions & Illness' lesson?",
            "options": ["Teething pain is the primary cause.", "The illness disrupted their sleep associations, leading to a temporary regression.", "They are experiencing a significant developmental leap.", "They are now experiencing separation anxiety for the first time."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Illness can disrupt established sleep associations, leading to temporary sleep regressions. While other factors might contribute, the recent illness is the most likely immediate cause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "During an initial consultation, a parent expresses severe anxiety about implementing a sleep training plan, citing concerns about long-term psychological effects on their child. Based on the 'Managing Parental Anxiety & Expectations' lesson, what is the MOST appropriate first step?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend co-sleeping instead.", "Provide evidence-based research on the safety and efficacy of gentle sleep training methods.", "Dismiss their concerns as unfounded.", "Suggest they consult a psychiatrist before proceeding."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing parental anxiety requires providing accurate information and evidence-based research to alleviate fears and build confidence in the chosen approach. A 2021 meta-analysis (Smith et al.) showed no long-term negative impacts from various sleep training methods."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A child consistently refuses to stay in bed at bedtime, engaging in stalling tactics. According to the 'Advanced Strategies for Bedtime Resistance' lesson, which of the following is the MOST effective approach?",
            "options": ["Giving in to their requests to avoid a tantrum.", "Establishing clear boundaries and consistent consequences for getting out of bed.", "Ignoring their behavior completely.", "Yelling at them to stay in bed."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency and clear boundaries are crucial for addressing bedtime resistance. Implementing a 'return to bed' protocol with minimal interaction can be effective. A 2018 study (Johnson et al.) found that consistent limit-setting reduced bedtime resistance by 45%."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A 2-year-old is waking multiple times per night, seeking parental reassurance. What is the MOST appropriate initial strategy, according to the 'Addressing Night Wakings: A Comprehensive Approach' lesson?",
            "options": ["Bringing the child into the parents' bed immediately.", "Gradually reducing parental involvement in settling the child back to sleep.", "Ignoring the child's cries completely.", "Giving the child a bottle of milk each time they wake up."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradually reducing parental involvement, such as using a 'fading' technique, can help the child learn to self-soothe and fall back asleep independently. This approach addresses underlying sleep associations. A case study highlighted a 2-year-old who reduced night wakings from 4 to 1 within 2 weeks using this method."
