            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step when parents report consistent co-sleeping that they now wish to change, despite initially intending to co-sleep?",
            "options": ["Immediately advising separate sleep spaces.", "Exploring the reasons behind the continued co-sleeping.", "Implementing a strict sleep schedule.", "Recommending a gradual withdrawal method without understanding the context."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding the reasons behind the continued co-sleeping is crucial to addressing the underlying needs and tailoring the intervention effectively. A 2021 study in the Journal of Family Psychology highlighted the importance of addressing parental motivations in co-sleeping interventions."

        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A family with a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old is experiencing significant bedtime battles and sleep disruptions, largely due to sibling rivalry. Which intervention strategy is MOST likely to be effective?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the rivalry and focusing on individual sleep training.", "Implementing a reward system for the older child only.", "Creating separate, positive bedtime routines for each child.", "Punishing both children for disruptive behavior."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating separate, positive bedtime routines addresses the individual needs of each child and minimizes opportunities for rivalry to disrupt sleep. This aligns with behavioral principles of positive reinforcement and reducing triggers for conflict. (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2018)"

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A new mother confides in you that she is experiencing postpartum depression and is struggling to implement the sleep plan you've created. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Continuing with the sleep plan as scheduled, as consistency is key.", "Referring her to a mental health professional and adjusting the sleep plan accordingly.", "Suggesting she try over-the-counter sleep aids.", "Dismissing her concerns as normal sleep deprivation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the mother's mental health is paramount. Postpartum depression can significantly impact a parent's ability to implement and maintain a sleep plan. Referral to a mental health professional ensures she receives appropriate support, and adjusting the sleep plan acknowledges her current capacity. A 2022 meta-analysis in JAMA Psychiatry highlighted the link between parental mental health and infant sleep outcomes."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "When working with a family from a collectivist culture where co-sleeping is the norm, which approach demonstrates the GREATEST cultural sensitivity?",
            "options": ["Insisting on immediate separation for optimal sleep.", "Acknowledging their cultural practices and exploring potential adaptations that align with their values and goals.", "Ignoring their cultural practices and implementing a standard sleep training protocol.", "Suggesting they are harming their child by co-sleeping."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural sensitivity involves respecting and understanding the family's values and beliefs. Acknowledging their cultural practices and working collaboratively to find solutions that align with their values is essential for building trust and achieving sustainable results. Research in Cross-Cultural Psychology (2019) emphasizes the importance of culturally adapted interventions."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A 15-month-old who previously took two naps is now consistently resisting the afternoon nap. What is the MOST likely explanation and appropriate intervention?",
            "options": ["The child is ready to drop to one nap; adjust the morning nap to be slightly longer and earlier.", "The child is simply being defiant; implement stricter naptime rules.", "The child is not tired enough; increase physical activity before naptime.", "The child is experiencing a sleep regression; wait it out."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "This is a common age for the transition from two naps to one. Lengthening the morning nap and shifting it earlier can help consolidate sleep and eliminate the need for the afternoon nap. (Mindell et al., 2016, Sleep Medicine Reviews)"

            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "When working with a child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and sleep difficulties, which of the following strategies is MOST crucial?",
            "options": ["Implementing a strict, inflexible sleep schedule.", "Ignoring sensory sensitivities to promote independence.", "Collaborating with the child's healthcare team and tailoring the plan to their specific needs and sensitivities.", "Using extinction methods to quickly eliminate sleep problems."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children with ASD often have unique sensory sensitivities and developmental needs. Collaboration with the healthcare team ensures a comprehensive and individualized approach. A study in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2020) emphasizes the importance of tailored interventions for children with ASD and sleep problems."

            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "A sleep coach guarantees specific sleep outcomes to a client, regardless of individual circumstances. Which ethical principle is the coach violating?",
            "options": ["Autonomy.", "Beneficence.", "Non-maleficence.", "Veracity."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Veracity refers to honesty and transparency. Guaranteeing specific outcomes is misleading and unethical, as individual results can vary significantly. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's code of ethics emphasizes the importance of honest and realistic communication with clients."

            "options": ["Focusing solely on short-term profits.", "Relying exclusively on social media advertising.", "Building strong relationships with referral sources, providing excellent client service, and obtaining professional liability insurance.", "Avoiding specialization to appeal to a broader audience."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Building a sustainable practice requires a long-term perspective. Strong referral relationships, excellent client service, and professional liability insurance are essential for building trust, ensuring client satisfaction, and mitigating risks.

            "question": "A client, Sarah, 32, is struggling with implementing a sleep plan for her 10-month-old. She reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious, often leading to inconsistent application of the strategies. As her coach, what is your BEST next step?",
            "options": ["Recommend she hire a night nanny to take over.", "Suggest she try harder and be more consistent.", "Acknowledge her feelings, explore specific challenges, and collaboratively adjust the plan to be more manageable, possibly referring her to a therapist.", "Tell her that if she doesn't follow the plan exactly, it won't work."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing the client's emotional state and collaboratively adjusting the plan demonstrates empathy and promotes adherence. Recognizing the link between parental anxiety and sleep outcomes is crucial. Referral to a therapist may be necessary if anxiety is significantly impacting her ability to implement the plan. (Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 2021)."

            "question": "You are coaching a family where the grandmother, who lives with them, strongly opposes any sleep training methods. The parents are committed to improving their child's sleep but feel pressured by the grandmother's disapproval. What is the MOST appropriate approach?",
            "options": ["Advise the parents to ignore the grandmother's concerns.", "Schedule a meeting with the grandmother to explain the benefits of sleep training without dismissing her concerns, and find mutually agreeable strategies.", "Tell the parents they need to move out to implement the plan effectively.", "Refuse to work with the family due to the conflicting opinions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the grandmother's concerns directly, respectfully, and finding mutually agreeable strategies is essential for creating a supportive environment for the parents. This approach acknowledges the family dynamics and promotes collaboration. A case study published in Family Process (2022) highlighted the importance of addressing intergenerational conflicts in family-based interventions."
