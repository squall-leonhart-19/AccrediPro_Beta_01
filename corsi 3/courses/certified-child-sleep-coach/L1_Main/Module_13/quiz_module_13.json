            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "A 2.5-year-old toddler, previously sleeping through the night, has started waking frequently, crying for a parent, and resisting going back to their own bed. Which of the following is the MOST likely contributing factor?",
            "options": ["Teething pain", "A recent growth spurt", "Separation anxiety intensified by a developmental leap", "Dietary iron deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While teething, growth spurts, and iron deficiency can disrupt sleep, separation anxiety, especially during a developmental leap (like increased imagination or self-awareness), is the most common cause of night wakings in toddlers of this age."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "Based on best practice recommendations, which of the following is the SAFEST co-sleeping arrangement?",
            "options": ["Co-sleeping on a couch or armchair", "Co-sleeping with a parent who is a smoker", "Co-sleeping with a parent who has taken sedating medication", "Co-sleeping on a firm mattress, without pillows or blankets near the infant's head, with a sober, breastfeeding parent"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Safe co-sleeping practices involve a firm surface, no loose bedding, and a sober, non-smoking parent. Couches, armchairs, and parental substance use significantly increase the risk of SIDS and accidental suffocation."

        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is experiencing significant sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep and frequent night wakings. Which of the following interventions should be considered FIRST, according to expert guidelines?",
            "options": ["Prescription sleep medication", "Behavioral interventions, such as creating a consistent bedtime routine and using visual supports", "Over-the-counter melatonin supplements", "Strict dietary restrictions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Behavioral interventions are the first-line treatment for sleep disturbances in children with ASD. Medication should only be considered after behavioral strategies have been exhausted and under the guidance of a medical professional."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "In the context of gentle sleep training methods, what does the term 'fading' refer to?",
            "options": ["Completely removing all parental presence at bedtime immediately.", "Gradually decreasing the amount of parental intervention required for the child to fall asleep.", "Switching between different sleep training methods each night.", "Ignoring the child's cries completely."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Fading' involves gradually reducing the level of parental support as the child learns to self-soothe. This minimizes distress and promotes independent sleep skills."

        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A client reports that their child consistently wakes up at 3:00 AM and is unable to fall back asleep for at least an hour. Which dietary adjustment might be MOST helpful in addressing this issue?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates from the child's dinner.", "Providing a protein-rich snack before bedtime.", "Giving the child a sugary drink before bed to promote relaxation.", "Completely restricting fluid intake after dinner."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A protein-rich snack before bed can help stabilize blood sugar levels throughout the night, preventing early morning awakenings caused by hunger or hypoglycemia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "A child with a history of sleep apnea is experiencing persistent sleep disturbances despite using a CPAP machine. What is the MOST important next step?",
            "options": ["Discontinuing CPAP use and trying a different treatment.", "Consulting with the child's pediatrician or pulmonologist to assess CPAP compliance and effectiveness.", "Increasing the CPAP pressure without medical supervision.", "Assuming the sleep disturbances are unrelated to sleep apnea."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Persistent sleep disturbances in a child with sleep apnea despite CPAP use warrant a medical evaluation to assess CPAP adherence, mask fit, and the effectiveness of the current pressure settings. Adjusting CPAP settings without medical supervision can be dangerous."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), what is the recommended duration for exclusive breastfeeding?",
            "options": ["3 months", "6 months", "9 months", "12 months"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, for as long as mutually desired."

            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A sleep coach is working with a family whose child has a diagnosed sleep disorder. Which of the following actions falls OUTSIDE the scope of practice for a sleep coach?",
            "options": ["Providing education on healthy sleep habits.", "Developing a personalized sleep plan based on the child's age and developmental stage.", "Recommending specific over-the-counter supplements.", "Adjusting the child's medication dosage."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Adjusting medication dosages is exclusively within the purview of a medical professional (e.g., pediatrician, sleep specialist). Sleep coaches can provide education and develop sleep plans but cannot provide medical advice or alter medication regimens."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "A 4-year-old child consistently refuses to go to bed at the designated bedtime, engaging in stalling tactics and tantrums. What is the MOST effective initial strategy?",
            "options": ["Giving in to the child's demands to avoid a tantrum.", "Implementing a consistent and predictable bedtime routine with clear boundaries.", "Punishing the child for refusing to go to bed.", "Allowing the child to stay up until they are naturally tired."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A consistent bedtime routine with clear boundaries provides structure and predictability, which can reduce bedtime resistance. Punishment and inconsistent bedtimes are generally counterproductive."

            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "You are working with a family who is considering using essential oils to promote their child's sleep. What is the MOST ethical and evidence-based approach to this situation?",
            "options": ["Strongly recommending specific essential oils based on anecdotal evidence.", "Discouraging the use of essential oils altogether due to potential risks.", "Presenting evidence-based information about the potential benefits and risks of essential oils, and allowing the parents to make an informed decision in consultation with their pediatrician.", "Promising guaranteed sleep improvements with the use of essential oils."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An ethical approach involves providing unbiased information about the potential benefits and risks of essential oils, emphasizing the limited scientific evidence, and encouraging parents to consult with their pediatrician before use. Making unsubstantiated claims or guarantees is unethical and potentially harmful."
