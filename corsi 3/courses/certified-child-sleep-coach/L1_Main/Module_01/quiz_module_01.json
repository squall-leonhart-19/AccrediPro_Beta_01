            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY goal of the 'Discover & Define' phase within the DREAM Framework™?",
            "options": ["Implementing a strict sleep training method.", "Gathering comprehensive information to understand the child's sleep challenges.", "Immediately addressing parental sleep concerns.", "Prescribing a specific sleep schedule."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Discover & Define' phase focuses on in-depth data collection and analysis to accurately understand the root causes of sleep issues before intervention."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on sleep history intake, what is the MINIMUM length of time a parent should ideally track their child's sleep patterns before a consultation?",
            "options": ["1-2 days", "3-5 days", "7-14 days", "21-28 days"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tracking sleep patterns for 7-14 days provides a more reliable baseline and helps identify trends that might be missed in shorter periods. This aligns with best practices for comprehensive sleep assessments."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Actigraphy data reveals fragmented sleep with frequent awakenings. The data shows an average sleep efficiency of 75% for a 3-year-old. What is the MOST appropriate initial interpretation of this data?",
            "options": ["The child is likely faking the awakenings.", "The sleep efficiency is within the normal range for a 3-year-old.", "The child's sleep is significantly disrupted and warrants further investigation.", "The child needs a later bedtime."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A sleep efficiency of 75% is below the typical range (85-95%) for a 3-year-old and indicates a significant sleep disturbance that needs further assessment to identify the underlying cause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which aspect of the sleep environment is MOST critical to assess for a 6-month-old to minimize SIDS risk, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)?",
            "options": ["Room temperature", "Use of blackout curtains", "Firmness of the mattress", "Presence of soft toys in the crib"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A firm sleep surface is a key recommendation by the AAP to reduce the risk of SIDS. Soft bedding and toys can pose a suffocation hazard."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "A 10-month-old infant who was previously sleeping through the night now experiences frequent night awakenings coinciding with new attempts at crawling. This is MOST likely due to:",
            "options": ["Teething pain", "A sleep regression related to motor skill development", "Separation anxiety", "Dietary changes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Motor skill development, such as crawling, is often associated with temporary sleep disruptions around this age as the infant practices these new skills, even during sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which medical condition is MOST commonly associated with restless leg syndrome (RLS) in children, potentially disrupting their sleep?",
            "options": ["Asthma", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Eczema", "Food allergies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency anemia is a known risk factor for RLS, which can cause uncomfortable sensations and an urge to move the legs, leading to sleep disturbances. A study published in *Sleep Medicine Reviews* (2015) highlighted the strong association between iron deficiency and RLS in children."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "When creating a problem statement during the 'Define' stage, what is the MOST important characteristic of the statement?",
            "options": ["It should be lengthy and detailed.", "It should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).", "It should focus solely on the child's symptoms.", "It should immediately propose a solution."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A SMART problem statement provides a clear, focused, and actionable definition of the sleep challenge, guiding the subsequent intervention strategies."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Client Sarah,' a 4-year-old with bedtime resistance, what parental practice was identified as a contributing factor to her sleep challenges?",
            "options": ["Consistent bedtime routine", "Early bedtime", "Inconsistent limit-setting around screen time before bed", "Providing a night light"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that inconsistent limit-setting regarding screen time before bed contributed to Sarah's bedtime resistance, as the stimulating content interfered with her ability to wind down."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A parent reports that their 2-year-old frequently wakes up screaming and inconsolable, but does not remember the episode in the morning. This is MOST likely indicative of:",
            "options": ["Nightmares", "Sleep terrors", "Sleepwalking", "Bedwetting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep terrors are characterized by screaming, inconsolable behavior during sleep, with no memory of the event upon waking. Nightmares, in contrast, are remembered upon waking."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of children experience some form of sleep disturbance during their development?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-25%", "25-40%", "50-75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 25-40% of children experience sleep disturbances, highlighting the prevalence of these issues and the importance of effective assessment and intervention strategies. A meta-analysis published in the *Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine* (2010) supports this statistic."
