        {
            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a core principle of gentle sleep training methods, emphasizing minimal parental separation and distress?",
            "options": ["Gradual Extinction", "Scheduled Awakenings", "Controlled Crying", "Parental Presence"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gentle sleep training prioritizes parental presence and responsiveness to minimize distress, contrasting with methods involving more separation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A parent is considering Cry-It-Out (CIO). What is the MOST crucial factor to assess BEFORE implementing this method?",
            "options": ["The baby's current weight percentile", "Underlying medical conditions or developmental delays", "The color of the baby's nursery", "The parent's preferred brand of diapers"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CIO should only be considered after ruling out any underlying medical or developmental issues that may be contributing to sleep problems, and after consulting with a pediatrician."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "Which responsive settling technique involves immediate parental intervention to soothe a crying infant, gradually increasing the time between interventions?",
            "options": ["Extinction", "Scheduled Awakenings", "Controlled Crying", "Fading"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Controlled crying (also known as graduated extinction or check-and-console) involves responding to the child's cries at increasing intervals, providing reassurance while allowing them to learn to self-soothe."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "According to research on co-sleeping, which of the following is considered a HIGH-RISK situation that should be avoided?",
            "options": ["Co-sleeping with a breastfeeding mother", "Co-sleeping on a firm mattress", "Co-sleeping with a parent who is a smoker", "Co-sleeping with a baby older than 6 months"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-sleeping with a parent who smokes, is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or is excessively tired significantly increases the risk of SIDS."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "A 10-month-old consistently wakes at 5:00 AM. What is the FIRST strategy you should recommend to address this early rising?",
            "options": ["Immediately move bedtime later", "Ensure the room is completely dark and consider using a white noise machine", "Start sleep training using the extinction method", "Offer a bottle immediately upon waking"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental factors like light and noise can significantly impact early risings. Ensuring a dark, quiet sleep environment is the initial step."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "When implementing nap training for a 6-month-old, what is a realistic expectation for the initial duration of independent sleep?",
            "options": ["3-4 hours", "2-3 hours", "1-2 hours", "30-45 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Initially, successful independent naps may only last 30-45 minutes. Consistency and patience are key as the baby learns to connect sleep cycles."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "Which sleep training method is GENERALLY considered MOST appropriate for newborns (0-3 months)?",
            "options": ["Extinction", "Controlled Crying", "Scheduled Awakenings", "Responsive Feeding and Soothing"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Newborns require responsive care. Sleep training methods like extinction or controlled crying are not appropriate at this age. Focus on meeting their needs promptly and establishing a consistent routine."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A family has been consistently using a bedtime routine for 2 weeks, but their child suddenly experiences a sleep regression due to teething. What is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Abandon the routine and try a new approach", "Maintain the routine consistently and offer extra comfort during teething", "Immediately start using the extinction method", "Consult a sleep specialist for medication"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining consistency during setbacks like teething is crucial. Providing extra comfort while sticking to the routine helps the child return to their established sleep patterns once the regression passes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 14-month-old who previously slept through the night now experiences frequent night wakings and is diagnosed with an ear infection. What is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Ignore the night wakings to avoid reinforcing them", "Immediately start CIO to re-establish sleep", "Address the ear infection with appropriate medical treatment and provide comfort", "Move the child to a separate room"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying medical issue (ear infection) is paramount. Providing comfort and pain relief will help resolve the sleep disruption caused by the illness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY goal of maintaining consistency in sleep training?",
            "options": ["To achieve perfect sleep immediately", "To confuse the child's sleep patterns", "To reinforce the learned sleep associations and promote long-term sleep habits", "To punish the child for not sleeping"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency reinforces the learned sleep associations, helping the child develop and maintain healthy, long-term sleep habits. Inconsistency can lead to confusion and setbacks."
