            "question": "According to research, what percentage of infants experience some form of sleep disturbance during their first year?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "25-35%", "40-50%", "60-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that 25-35% of infants experience sleep disturbances, highlighting the prevalence of sleep-related concerns in early infancy."

            "question": "Which developmental milestone is MOST likely to disrupt an infant's sleep around 4 months of age?",
            "options": ["Rolling over", "Sitting up", "Crawling", "Walking"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Rolling over is a significant milestone around 4 months and can disrupt sleep as infants may get stuck on their stomachs and be unable to roll back."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "What is the recommended room temperature range for creating an optimal sleep environment for infants?",
            "options": ["60-64°F (15-18°C)", "65-70°F (18-21°C)", "71-75°F (22-24°C)", "76-80°F (24-27°C)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ideal room temperature for infant sleep is between 65-70°F (18-21°C) to prevent overheating and ensure comfortable sleep."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports that her 2-month-old is consistently falling asleep while feeding and then waking up shortly after being put down. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Suggest night weaning", "Advise increasing daytime feeding frequency", "Recommend a stricter feeding schedule", "Encourage dream feeding"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increasing daytime feeding frequency can help ensure the infant is adequately fed during the day, reducing the likelihood of falling asleep during feeds and waking up hungry soon after."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While self-soothing is a goal, it's not realistic or recommended to expect it from day one. Newborns need support and comfort to regulate their sleep."

            "options": ["On their stomach", "On their side", "On their back", "In a swing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "In a case study presented, a 4-month-old, Liam, was experiencing frequent night wakings. After implementing a consistent bedtime routine and optimizing the sleep environment, Liam's night wakings decreased from 4-5 times per night to:",
            "options": ["0-1 times per night", "2-3 times per night", "3-4 times per night", "He continued to wake 4-5 times per night"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
