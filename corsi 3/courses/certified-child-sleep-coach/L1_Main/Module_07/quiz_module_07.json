            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique is MOST effective in identifying subtle sleep-related breathing issues in infants?",
            "options": ["Parental sleep diary analysis alone", "Actigraphy combined with parental questionnaires", "Video polysomnography (vPSG) after initial screening", "Home cardiorespiratory monitoring as a first-line assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Video polysomnography (vPSG) is considered the gold standard for comprehensively assessing sleep-related breathing disorders, providing detailed physiological data not captured by other methods. While actigraphy and home monitoring are helpful, vPSG offers a more in-depth analysis, especially after initial concerns arise."

            "question": "According to research on infant temperament, which temperament trait is MOST associated with increased sleep difficulties and parental stress?",
            "options": ["High adaptability", "Low intensity of reaction", "High sensory threshold", "High reactivity/sensitivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Infants with high reactivity or sensitivity tend to have more difficulty self-soothing and adjusting to changes in their environment, leading to increased sleep problems and parental stress. This is supported by studies showing a correlation between reactive temperament and sleep disturbances."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, expresses frustration that her 18-month-old still wakes 2-3 times per night. Applying the 'R' in DREAM, which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial reframing strategy?",
            "options": ["Insisting that all toddlers should sleep through the night by 18 months.", "Normalizing that some toddlers continue to have night wakings at this age and focusing on strategies to minimize parental disruption.", "Suggesting immediate and strict sleep training methods to eliminate all night wakings.", "Ignoring the client's concerns and focusing solely on daytime routines."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reframing expectations involves providing realistic information and normalizing that some sleep patterns are developmentally appropriate. Acknowledging that night wakings can persist while offering strategies to manage them is a supportive and effective approach. According to a study in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology, parental stress is reduced when realistic expectations are set."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which element is MOST crucial when crafting a personalized bedtime routine for a 3-year-old with sensory processing sensitivities?",
            "options": ["A highly stimulating and energetic activity to tire the child out.", "A predictable sequence of calming activities with minimal sensory input.", "A long and complex routine with multiple steps to ensure thorough preparation for sleep.", "Inconsistent timing of activities to prevent the child from anticipating bedtime."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Children with sensory sensitivities benefit from predictable, calming routines with minimal sensory overload. Loud noises, bright lights, or rough textures can be dysregulating. A consistent and soothing routine promotes relaxation and prepares the child for sleep."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "When implementing a gentle sleep training technique like the 'chair method,' what is the PRIMARY focus?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating parental presence from the room.", "Gradually increasing the physical distance between the parent and the child while providing verbal reassurance.", "Allowing the child to cry until they fall asleep independently.", "Quickly exiting the room after putting the child in bed."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'chair method' emphasizes gradual withdrawal, where the parent remains in the room initially, providing comfort and reassurance, and then slowly increases the distance over successive nights. This approach aims to reduce separation anxiety and promote self-soothing."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "What is the MOST important element of responsive settling in promoting secure attachment?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the child's cries to encourage self-soothing.", "Consistently and sensitively responding to the child's needs and cues.", "Following a rigid sleep schedule regardless of the child's cues.", "Minimizing all physical contact during settling."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Responsive settling involves consistently and sensitively responding to the child's cues and needs, providing comfort and reassurance. This promotes a sense of security and strengthens the parent-child attachment bond. Research by Mary Ainsworth highlights the importance of parental responsiveness in secure attachment development."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "When monitoring progress during sleep coaching, what is the MOST reliable and objective measure of success?",
            "options": ["Parental perception of improved sleep.", "Changes in daytime behavior reported by the parent.", "Actigraphy data showing reduced wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO).", "The child sleeping through the night every night."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While parental perception and daytime behavior are important, actigraphy provides objective data on sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO). This allows for a more accurate assessment of progress. Studies show that actigraphy can effectively track changes in sleep patterns during intervention."

            "question": "A client asks you for medical advice regarding their child's suspected sleep apnea. What is the MOST appropriate ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Providing your opinion based on your knowledge of sleep disorders.", "Referring them to a qualified medical professional, such as a pediatrician or sleep specialist.", "Recommending over-the-counter remedies for sleep apnea.", "Suggesting a specific brand of humidifier that might help."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing medical advice is outside the scope of practice for a child sleep coach. It is essential to refer clients to qualified medical professionals for diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. This protects both the client and the coach from potential harm and legal issues."

            "question": "You are working with a family who is co-sleeping with their 6-month-old. They are interested in transitioning to independent sleep, but are concerned about SIDS. What is the MOST appropriate and evidence-based recommendation?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to continue co-sleeping as it is the safest option for infants.", "Recommend immediate and complete separation, regardless of parental comfort.", "Provide information on safe sleep guidelines, including room sharing without bed sharing, and support their decision-making process.", "Suggest a specific type of crib that is marketed as 'SIDS-reducing'."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends room sharing without bed sharing for at least the first six months to reduce the risk of SIDS. Providing families with this information and supporting their decision-making process, while respecting their cultural values, is the most ethical and evidence-based approach."

            "question": "A client reports that their child's sleep significantly regressed after starting daycare. Which strategy is MOST likely to address this issue effectively?",
            "options": ["Recommending the family switch daycares immediately.", "Implementing stricter bedtime rules and eliminating all comfort objects.", "Collaborating with the daycare provider to understand the child's daytime routine and stress levels, and adjusting the home routine accordingly.", "Ignoring the daycare situation and focusing solely on the nighttime routine."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Daycare can introduce new stressors and routines that impact a child's sleep. Collaborating with the daycare provider to understand the child's experiences and adjusting the home routine to provide additional support and comfort is essential for addressing sleep regressions in this context."
