        {
            "id": "q3_1",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what is a primary neurological benefit of consistent bedtime routines for children?",
            "options": ["Increased appetite regulation", "Enhanced synaptic pruning during sleep", "Improved cortisol regulation and reduced stress response", "Decreased REM sleep latency"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistent routines help regulate the child's circadian rhythm and HPA axis, leading to better cortisol management and reduced stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY element of a successful bedtime routine, regardless of a child's age?",
            "options": ["High-intensity physical activity", "Dim lighting and reduced sensory stimulation", "Engaging in screen time to promote relaxation", "Eating a large meal right before bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dim lighting signals the brain to release melatonin, promoting relaxation and preparing the child for sleep. Reducing sensory stimulation helps calm the nervous system."
        },

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "For an infant (0-12 months), what is the recommended duration for a bedtime routine?",
            "options": ["5-10 minutes", "20-30 minutes", "45-60 minutes", "90 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 20-30 minute routine is ideal for infants, allowing sufficient time for calming activities without overstimulation."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "A toddler (1-3 years) is resisting bedtime and exhibiting increased separation anxiety. Which of the following strategies would be MOST appropriate to implement?",
            "options": ["Extinction method (leaving the child alone until they fall asleep)", "Offering a comfort object and engaging in a short, predictable routine with clear limits", "Skipping the bedtime routine to minimize distress", "Allowing the toddler to sleep in the parent's bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comfort object and a predictable routine provide security and reduce anxiety. Setting clear limits is also important for establishing healthy sleep habits."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "For a preschooler (3-5 years) who is afraid of the dark, what is a recommended addition to their bedtime routine?",
            "options": ["Removing all light sources from the room", "Using a very bright nightlight", "Incorporating a calming story about overcoming fears and using a dim nightlight", "Allowing them to stay up later to tire themselves out"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A calming story can help address the child's fears, and a dim nightlight provides reassurance without disrupting sleep."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a crucial element to consider when establishing a naptime routine for a child?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the naptime routine is significantly different from the bedtime routine", "Keeping the naptime environment bright and stimulating", "Maintaining consistency in timing and environment, even on weekends", "Skipping the naptime routine on weekends to promote longer nighttime sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistency is key for regulating the child's circadian rhythm and promoting predictable sleep patterns."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "A client reports that their child's bedtime routine has become ineffective due to a recent move. What is the MOST appropriate initial step to address this challenge?",
            "options": ["Immediately implementing a strict 'cry it out' approach", "Re-evaluating the routine and making gradual adjustments to accommodate the new environment", "Ignoring the issue and hoping it resolves on its own", "Prescribing medication to induce sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Changes in environment can disrupt sleep routines. A re-evaluation and gradual adjustments are necessary to re-establish healthy sleep habits."

            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "According to the DREAM framework, where does establishing routines primarily fall?",
            "options": ["Duration", "Rhythm", "Environment", "Associations", "Method"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in DREAM stands for Rhythm, which encompasses the importance of consistent routines in regulating a child's sleep-wake cycle."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a 4-year-old, 'Liam', consistently stalled at bedtime, requesting multiple drinks of water. What strategy was MOST effective in addressing this behavior?",
            "options": ["Completely denying water requests after the routine started", "Allowing unlimited water requests to avoid conflict", "Offering one small cup of water at the beginning of the routine and setting a clear limit", "Ignoring the requests and hoping they would stop"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Setting a clear limit while still addressing the child's need (thirst) is a balanced and effective approach."

            "question": "A parent is concerned that their infant's (6-month-old) bedtime routine is too long (45 minutes). What is the potential negative consequence of an excessively long routine?",
            "options": ["Increased melatonin production", "Improved sleep consolidation", "Overstimulation and increased difficulty falling asleep", "Decreased cortisol levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An overly long routine can be stimulating and counterproductive, making it harder for the infant to wind down and fall asleep."
