            "question": "A client with a history of complex trauma presents with significant dissociation. Which of the following somatic interventions is MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Intense emotional processing", "Grounding and stabilization exercises", "Directly accessing traumatic memories", "Rapid eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)"],

            "question": "In the case of Sarah, a 35-year-old client with attachment trauma who struggles with intimacy, which of the following somatic techniques would be LEAST helpful initially?",
            "options": ["Mirroring exercises to build co-regulation", "Exploring early childhood experiences through body awareness", "Encouraging independent emotional regulation before co-regulation", "Challenging her beliefs about relationships directly through cognitive restructuring"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Directly challenging beliefs without addressing the underlying somatic and emotional experiences related to attachment trauma can be invalidating and ineffective. Somatic work prioritizes bottom-up processing."

            "question": "A child client exhibits somatic fixations related to developmental trauma, such as persistent thumb-sucking and rocking. What is the PRIMARY goal of somatic interventions in this scenario?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to foster a sense of safety and regulation in the body, allowing the child to gradually release the somatic fixations as they feel more secure."
