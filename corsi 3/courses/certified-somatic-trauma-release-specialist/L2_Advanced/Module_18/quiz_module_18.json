            "options": ["Completely flooding the system with positive resources", "Gradually introducing and processing small amounts of traumatic material", "Avoiding any discussion of traumatic events", "Using medication to numb emotional responses"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves carefully and gradually processing small amounts of traumatic material, allowing the nervous system to adapt and integrate without becoming overwhelmed."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploration, specifically sensory exploration, helps clients reconnect with their bodies and re-establish a sense of presence and embodiment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sarah found progressive muscle relaxation especially effective in calming her nervous system and reducing anxiety symptoms associated with her childhood trauma."

            "question": "What is 'pendulation' in the context of somatic trauma work?",
            "options": ["A technique for suppressing unwanted thoughts", "Moving back and forth between a sense of safety and a trauma-related sensation", "Rapid eye movement desensitization", "A type of cognitive restructuring"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation involves alternating attention between safe, resourced states and trauma-related sensations, allowing the nervous system to gradually process and integrate traumatic material."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
