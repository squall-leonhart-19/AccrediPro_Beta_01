            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial response to a client experiencing acute traumatic stress?",
            "options": ["Encouraging detailed recounting of the traumatic event.", "Immediately implementing advanced somatic techniques.", "Establishing a sense of safety and stabilization.", "Challenging the client's cognitive distortions about the event."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and stabilization is paramount in acute traumatic stress. Detailed recounting or advanced techniques can be retraumatizing at this stage."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Orienting to the present environment helps bring the client back to the here-and-now and can reduce dissociation, as covered in L2. Pendulation and Titration may be too intense initially."
