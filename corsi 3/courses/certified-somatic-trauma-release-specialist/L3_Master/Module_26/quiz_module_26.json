            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "According to the core principles discussed in L1, which of the following is the MOST important initial step in designing a Somatic Trauma Release program?",
            "options": ["Implementing advanced trauma-release techniques.", "Establishing clear program goals and objectives.", "Focusing primarily on cognitive processing of traumatic events.", "Rapidly inducing catharsis to release pent-up emotions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing clear program goals and objectives is foundational. Without these, the program lacks direction and cannot be effectively evaluated, aligning with the principles outlined in L1."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In L2, what is the recommended strategy for structuring individual sessions within a Somatic Trauma Release program curriculum?",
            "options": ["Begin with intense emotional processing followed by grounding exercises.", "Follow a rigid, pre-determined script for each session.", "Progress from simple resourcing and stabilization techniques to more complex trauma processing.", "Immediately address the most triggering aspects of the trauma to facilitate rapid resolution."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L2 emphasizes a gradual approach, starting with resourcing and stabilization before moving to more complex trauma processing. This ensures client safety and promotes effective integration."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, 35, presents with chronic anxiety and hypervigilance following a car accident. According to L3, which somatic technique would be MOST appropriate to introduce initially?",
            "options": ["Pendulation exercises to explore the trauma narrative.", "Titration to gradually expose Sarah to the traumatic memory.", "Grounding exercises to enhance present moment awareness and safety.", "Directly confronting the most distressing aspects of the car accident."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's anxiety and hypervigilance, grounding exercises are the most appropriate initial intervention. This helps her establish a sense of safety and present moment awareness, which is crucial before engaging in more direct trauma processing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "L4 emphasizes the importance of building resourcing strategies. Which of the following is NOT considered a core resourcing technique?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness meditation.", "Progressive muscle relaxation.", "Creating a detailed timeline of the traumatic event.", "Visualization of a safe and supportive environment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While understanding the timeline of events is important, it's not primarily a resourcing technique. Resourcing focuses on building internal and external resources for coping and stabilization."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "In L5, what is the primary consideration when managing group dynamics in a Somatic Trauma Release program?",
            "options": ["Encouraging open and immediate sharing of traumatic experiences.", "Maintaining a strict and controlled environment to minimize emotional dysregulation.", "Creating a safe and supportive space that fosters trust and mutual respect.", "Focusing solely on individual processing to avoid potential triggers from other participants."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Creating a safe and supportive space is paramount. This includes establishing clear boundaries, promoting respectful communication, and ensuring participants feel empowered to share at their own pace."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "According to L6, which of the following is the MOST effective method for evaluating the outcomes of a Somatic Trauma Release program?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on participant testimonials and anecdotal evidence.", "Using a combination of standardized questionnaires, self-report measures, and observational data.", "Conducting a single post-program assessment to gauge overall satisfaction.", "Focusing exclusively on physiological measures of stress reduction."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive evaluation approach involves multiple data sources, including standardized questionnaires (e.g., PCL-5, GAD-7), self-report measures, and observational data. This provides a more nuanced understanding of program outcomes."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "In L7, what is the key principle for effectively marketing a Somatic Trauma Release program?",
            "options": ["Promising immediate and complete resolution of trauma symptoms.", "Emphasizing the program's intensity and potential for rapid transformation.", "Highlighting the program's evidence-based approach and commitment to client safety.", "Targeting a broad audience to maximize enrollment and revenue."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing involves transparency and accuracy. Highlighting the program's evidence-based approach, qualifications of the facilitator, and commitment to client safety builds trust and attracts appropriate participants."

            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "A 2023 survey of 50 STR programs revealed that programs incorporating regular facilitator supervision and self-care practices demonstrated a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30%</span> higher rate of long-term sustainability (defined as operating for >5 years). This statistic best relates to content discussed in which lesson?",
            "options": ["L5: Managing Group Dynamics and Facilitating Safe Spaces", "L6: Evaluation and Outcome Measurement", "L7: Marketing and Promoting Your Somatic Trauma Release Program", "L8: Sustainability and Long-Term Program Planning"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The statistic directly relates to factors influencing the sustainability of STR programs, a core topic in L8. Facilitator well-being is a critical element in long-term program success."

            "options": ["Maintaining a fixed program structure and content to ensure consistency.", "Continuously adapting the program based on client feedback, emerging research, and facilitator experience.", "Minimizing program costs to maximize profitability and attract more participants.", "Solely relying on the facilitator's personal experience and intuition."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptability is key to sustainability. Continuously adapting the program based on feedback, research, and experience ensures its relevance and effectiveness over time."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "You are designing a 12-week Somatic Trauma Release program. Based on the principles discussed across this module, which of the following program structures would be MOST effective?",
            "options": ["Weeks 1-3: Psychoeducation and cognitive restructuring; Weeks 4-12: Intensive trauma narrative processing.", "Weeks 1-4: Building resourcing skills and establishing safety; Weeks 5-8: Gradual introduction of somatic techniques for trauma processing; Weeks 9-12: Integration and relapse prevention planning.", "Weeks 1-6: Individual therapy sessions focused on trauma recall; Weeks 7-12: Group sessions for emotional catharsis.", "Weeks 1-12: Consistent application of a single, standardized somatic technique for all participants."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most effective structure prioritizes safety and gradual progression. Beginning with resourcing, introducing somatic techniques incrementally, and ending with integration aligns with the principles of trauma-informed care and promotes lasting positive outcomes."
