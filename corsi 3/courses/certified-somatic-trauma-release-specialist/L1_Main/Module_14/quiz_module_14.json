            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of neuroception, as described by Polyvagal Theory, and how it relates to resourcing?",
            "options": ["A conscious evaluation of environmental threats.", "A cognitive appraisal of social cues.", "An unconscious assessment of safety or danger that influences physiological states.", "A learned behavior to avoid threatening situations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is the unconscious process by which the nervous system detects threats or safety cues, directly influencing our physiological state. Resourcing aims to enhance the perception of safety."

        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a history of childhood trauma and reports feeling 'numb' during sessions. Which somatic technique would be MOST appropriate to gently introduce sensation exploration?",
            "options": ["Directly exploring the traumatic memory.", "Encouraging intense emotional release.", "Titration, starting with small, manageable sensations.", "Using forceful bodywork to release tension."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves carefully introducing small doses of sensation to build tolerance and avoid overwhelming the client, especially when dissociation is present."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the purpose of pendulation in somatic trauma therapy?",
            "options": ["To rapidly expose the client to traumatic memories.", "To avoid any contact with potentially triggering sensations.", "To help the client move between resourced states and trauma-related sensations in a controlled manner.", "To suppress unwanted emotions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation helps clients build resilience by moving between safe and challenging experiences, allowing the nervous system to gradually process trauma."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client is experiencing significant dissociation during a session. What is the FIRST priority in terms of stabilization?",
            "options": ["Immediately processing the traumatic memory.", "Grounding and orienting the client to the present moment.", "Encouraging emotional catharsis.", "Using hypnotic techniques to access repressed memories."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing grounding and present moment awareness helps the client reconnect with their body and environment, providing a sense of safety and control before addressing trauma content."

            "question": "According to Attachment Theory, which of the following is a key goal in repairing relational wounds related to trauma?",
            "options": ["Forgetting about past negative experiences.", "Developing a secure attachment style through corrective experiences.", "Blaming caregivers for past harm.", "Becoming completely independent and self-reliant."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secure attachment is fostered through consistent, attuned relationships that provide a sense of safety and trust, helping to heal the impact of early relational trauma. This involves corrective emotional experiences."

            "options": ["Repression", "Regulation", "Rejection", "Retaliation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.E.Body. framework, 'R' stands for Regulation, emphasizing the importance of nervous system regulation in addressing complex trauma. The framework also includes Embodiment, Boundaries, Ownership, Development, and Yielding."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with resourcing – connecting with safety and calm – helps build a foundation for processing trauma without overwhelming the client's nervous system. A 2018 study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress showed improved outcomes when resourcing precedes trauma processing."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A therapist certified in basic Somatic Experiencing begins working with a client exhibiting symptoms of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder). What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DID is a complex condition that requires specialized expertise. Consulting with a supervisor and potentially co-treating ensures the client receives appropriate and ethical care. A 2021 meta-analysis highlighted the importance of specialized training when working with dissociative disorders."
