            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the vagus nerve is associated with social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal complex", "Ventral vagal complex", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Parasympathetic nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal complex is responsible for social engagement, communication, and feelings of safety, allowing for connection and regulation."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In the context of titration, what does 'staying within the window of tolerance' refer to?",
            "options": ["Exposing the client to the maximum intensity of sensation for rapid processing.", "Gradually approaching and retreating from traumatic material to regulate arousal.", "Completely avoiding any discussion of traumatic events.", "Encouraging the client to immediately confront their deepest fears."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves carefully approaching and retreating from traumatic material, allowing the client to process small amounts of sensation within their window of tolerance, preventing overwhelm and promoting integration."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of interoception?",
            "options": ["Seeing a red light", "Hearing a loud noise", "Feeling your heartbeat", "Smelling freshly baked bread"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body, including sensations like heartbeat, breathing, and hunger."

            "options": ["Regulation", "Resistance", "Resonance", "Reactivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the R.E.Body. Framework™, 'R' stands for Regulation, which involves techniques for managing and stabilizing the nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "A client with attachment trauma consistently seeks reassurance and validation from you. What somatic intervention would be MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to explore their earliest childhood memories.", "Guiding them to connect with the felt sense of safety and grounding in their body.", "Immediately challenging their need for reassurance.", "Recommending they seek medication to manage their anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on grounding and safety helps the client regulate their nervous system and develop a sense of internal security, which can reduce the need for external validation. Addressing early memories prematurely could be overwhelming."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "According to research cited in the module, what percentage of therapists report experiencing vicarious trauma?",
            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 20-30%", "Around 50-60%", "Over 80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 20-30% of therapists experience vicarious trauma due to exposure to clients' traumatic experiences."

            "question": "Which of the following is an ethical consideration regarding scope of practice for a Certified Somatic Trauma Release Specialist™?",
            "options": ["Diagnosing mental health disorders.", "Providing services only within areas of competency and training.", "Prescribing medication for anxiety.", "Guaranteeing specific outcomes for clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires specialists to only provide services within their areas of competence and training, avoiding practices that fall outside their scope."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of pendulation in somatic trauma work?",
            "options": ["To completely eliminate all sensations related to the trauma.", "To rapidly expose the client to the most intense traumatic memories.", "To help the client move between states of contraction and expansion, building resilience.", "To force the client to confront their fears directly."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pendulation helps clients build resilience by gently moving between states of contraction (related to the trauma) and expansion (resourceful states), promoting nervous system regulation."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 35, presents with chronic anxiety and difficulty forming close relationships, stemming from early childhood neglect. Which somatic approach would be LEAST suitable as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Gentle movement exercises to increase body awareness.", "Guided imagery to create a sense of safety and containment.", "Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) focused on specific traumatic memories.", "Grounding techniques to regulate her nervous system."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "EMDR targeting specific traumatic memories might be overwhelming for Sarah initially. Grounding, gentle movement, and guided imagery are more appropriate for building a foundation of safety and regulation before addressing specific traumas."
