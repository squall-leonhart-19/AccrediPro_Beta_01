            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the vagus nerve is associated with social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Ventral Vagal", "Spinal Nerves"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal branch is responsible for social engagement and calming, promoting feelings of safety and connection."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "In somatic experiencing, what is 'titration' primarily used for?",
            "options": ["To completely eliminate traumatic memories.", "To overwhelm the nervous system for faster processing.", "To gradually expose the individual to manageable fragments of traumatic experience.", "To avoid any contact with trauma-related sensations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves exposing the individual to small, manageable amounts of trauma-related sensations, allowing the nervous system to gradually process and integrate the experience without becoming overwhelmed."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Which sensory system provides information about the body's position in space and is crucial for movement coordination?",
            "options": ["Interoception", "Exteroception", "Proprioception", "Neuroception"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioception provides information about the body's position and movement, contributing to coordination and balance. Interoception relates to internal body sensations, and exteroception to external sensory input."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Implicit memory, often implicated in trauma, is best described as:",
            "options": ["Consciously recalled memories of events.", "Skills, habits, and emotional responses that are not consciously recalled.", "Detailed narratives of traumatic experiences.", "Memories stored solely in the hippocampus."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implicit memory encompasses skills, habits, and emotional responses that are not consciously recalled but still influence behavior. Trauma can be stored implicitly and manifest as unexplained physical or emotional reactions."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client consistently blames themselves for a traumatic event, stating 'I should have known better.' Which somatic approach is MOST appropriate to address this self-blame?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to analyze the situation logically.", "Helping them connect with sensations of self-compassion and challenge the self-blaming narrative through body-based interventions.", "Ignoring the self-blame and focusing on the factual details of the event.", "Providing reassurance that it wasn't their fault."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic approaches emphasize connecting with bodily sensations to challenge negative self-beliefs. Connecting with sensations of self-compassion and challenging the self-blaming narrative through body-based interventions directly addresses the body's experience of shame and self-blame."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST ethical approach to transference in somatic trauma work?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the transference to avoid complicating therapy.", "Engaging in a dual relationship with the client to strengthen the therapeutic bond.", "Openly acknowledging the transference and exploring it within the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship.", "Dismissing the client's feelings as irrational."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and exploring transference within appropriate boundaries is crucial for ethical practice. Ignoring or engaging in dual relationships can be harmful and unethical."

            "question": "In the REBody framework, what does the 'E' represent?",
            "options": ["External Resources", "Emotional Regulation", "Energetic Release", "Embodied Awareness"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In the REBody framework, 'E' stands for Embodied Awareness, emphasizing the importance of connecting with and understanding one's body sensations and experiences."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "Which of the following somatic practices is MOST likely to foster post-traumatic growth?",
            "options": ["Prolonged exposure to traumatic memories.", "Focusing solely on eliminating negative emotions.", "Engaging in mindful movement and body-based practices that promote self-efficacy and connection.", "Avoiding any discussion of the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindful movement and body-based practices can promote self-efficacy and connection, fostering resilience and post-traumatic growth by empowering individuals to reconnect with their bodies and find strength within themselves."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'stuck' and unable to move forward in their trauma recovery. Which somatic technique would be MOST helpful in releasing this stagnation?",
            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring", "Pendulation between contracted and expanded states.", "Flooding", "Complete avoidance of trauma-related topics."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pendulation helps to release stagnation by gently moving between contracted states (representing the stuckness) and expanded states (representing potential for movement and growth), allowing the nervous system to gradually process and integrate the experience."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "During a session, a client suddenly dissociates and becomes unresponsive. What is the FIRST and MOST important step a practitioner should take?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin a detailed exploration of the traumatic memory.", "Attempt to ground the client using simple sensory-based interventions, such as focusing on their breath or the feeling of their feet on the ground.", "Call emergency services.", "Leave the client alone to allow them to process their emotions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The immediate priority is to ground the client and bring them back to the present moment using simple sensory-based interventions. This helps to restore a sense of safety and stability before attempting any further exploration of the trauma."
