            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the vagus nerve is associated with social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal complex", "Ventral vagal complex", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Parasympathetic nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal complex is responsible for social engagement and feelings of safety, allowing for connection and communication."

            "question": "What is the primary goal of titration in somatic trauma release?",
            "options": ["To overwhelm the client with intense emotions", "To gradually expose the client to trauma-related sensations", "To completely avoid any sensations related to the trauma", "To quickly resolve the trauma in a single session"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves gradually exposing the client to trauma-related sensations in small, manageable doses to avoid overwhelming their system."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement in space, contributing to body awareness and coordination."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation involves one person influencing another's nervous system to promote stability and regulation, often through mirroring and attuned responses."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The REBody Framework™ integrates resourcing (building safety and stability), exploration (gentle engagement with sensations), and body awareness (cultivating interoceptive and proprioceptive awareness)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dissociation can manifest as feeling detached from one's body, surroundings, or emotions, often as a protective mechanism against overwhelming experiences."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
