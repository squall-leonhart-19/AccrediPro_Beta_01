            "question": "Which branch of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is primarily responsible for the 'fight or flight' response?",
            "options": ["Parasympathetic Nervous System", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Enteric Nervous System", "Vagus Nerve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Sympathetic Nervous System activates the body's stress response, preparing it to confront or escape perceived threats. The Parasympathetic Nervous System promotes relaxation and recovery."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of resourcing in somatic trauma therapy?",
            "options": ["To directly confront traumatic memories", "To build a sense of safety and stability", "To induce abreaction", "To analyze the client's past"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resourcing focuses on creating a stable foundation for trauma work by identifying and strengthening internal and external resources that promote safety and well-being. This aligns with the case study of Client Sarah, who initially struggled with anxiety but found solace in her connection with nature."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "When exploring sensations with a trauma-informed approach, what is the MOST important guideline?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to push through discomfort", "Staying within the client's window of tolerance", "Rapidly processing all associated memories", "Using forceful touch to release tension"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Remaining within the client's <span class=\"highlight\">window of tolerance</span> is crucial to prevent re-traumatization. This involves titrating the experience and ensuring the client feels safe and in control. As highlighted in the lesson, pushing beyond this window can lead to dysregulation."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key benefit of body awareness and movement in releasing trapped energy?",
            "options": ["It bypasses the need for cognitive processing", "It facilitates the discharge of stored trauma responses", "It always leads to immediate catharsis", "It eliminates the need for verbal processing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body awareness and movement techniques, such as gentle shaking or mindful stretching, can help release <span class=\"highlight\">trapped energy</span> in the body, allowing for the completion of defensive responses that were interrupted during the traumatic event. As seen with Client Michael who experienced increased calmness after engaging in mindful movement."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a defining characteristic of dissociation?",
            "options": ["Increased emotional reactivity", "A sense of detachment from oneself or the surroundings", "Enhanced memory recall", "Heightened sensory awareness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation involves a disruption in the normally integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception. This can manifest as a sense of detachment from oneself (depersonalization) or the surroundings (derealization). According to research, approximately 20-30% of individuals with PTSD experience significant dissociative symptoms."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "A client suddenly experiences a flashback during a session. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately delving into the details of the traumatic event", "Helping the client orient to the present moment and regain a sense of safety", "Encouraging the client to suppress the memory", "Ignoring the flashback and continuing with the planned session"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The priority is to help the client ground themselves in the present moment and regain a sense of safety. This may involve using grounding techniques, such as focusing on sensory details or breathing exercises. As noted in the lesson, re-traumatization can occur if the client is not properly supported during a flashback."

            "id": "q7_7",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapists must carefully evaluate and manage potential conflicts of interest arising from dual relationships. While avoiding dual relationships is ideal, it's not always possible in smaller communities. Transparency and prioritizing the client's well-being are paramount. The lesson emphasizes the importance of consulting with supervisors when navigating complex ethical dilemmas."

            "id": "q7_8",

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a client reports feeling numb and detached during sessions. According to the lesson on dissociation, what might be a helpful intervention?",
            "options": ["Encouraging intense emotional expression", "Using grounding techniques to reconnect the client with their body", "Immediately exploring the traumatic memories", "Administering a high dose of caffeine to increase alertness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques, such as focusing on sensory details (e.g., the feeling of their feet on the floor), can help reconnect the client with their body and the present moment, reducing the sense of detachment associated with dissociation. As seen in the case study example, gentle movement and sensory awareness can be beneficial."

            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "A client becomes triggered by a loud noise, experiencing a sudden surge of anxiety and hypervigilance. According to the principles discussed in 'Working with Trauma Triggers and Flashbacks,' what is the LEAST helpful response?",
            "options": ["Validating the client's experience and offering reassurance", "Helping the client identify the trigger and its association with the trauma", "Encouraging the client to avoid all similar noises in the future", "Guiding the client through a grounding exercise to regain a sense of safety"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While it's important to validate the client's experience and help them manage triggers, encouraging complete avoidance is not a sustainable long-term solution. Instead, the goal is to help the client gradually desensitize to the trigger in a safe and controlled environment. This aligns with the principles of exposure therapy, which has demonstrated a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">60-80% success rate</span> in reducing PTSD symptoms."
