            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which of the following is the primary function of the ventral vagal pathway?",
            "options": ["Fight-or-flight response", "Freeze response", "Social engagement and connection", "Digestive processes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal pathway is responsible for social engagement, connection, and feelings of safety. It inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and dorsal vagal complex."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and dysregulated during a session. Which resourcing technique would be MOST appropriate to implement FIRST?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to describe their trauma narrative in detail", "Guiding them through a grounding exercise focusing on their senses", "Having them engage in a vigorous physical activity", "Suggesting they visualize a future positive outcome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises help bring the client back to the present moment and regulate their nervous system. Describing the trauma narrative when dysregulated can be re-traumatizing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "What is the purpose of 'titration' in somatic trauma release?",
            "options": ["To completely eliminate traumatic memories", "To gradually expose the client to small amounts of traumatic material", "To rapidly process all traumatic experiences", "To avoid any discussion of traumatic events"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves carefully and gradually exposing the client to small, manageable amounts of traumatic material to avoid overwhelming their nervous system. This allows for processing in a safe and controlled manner."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Somatic Experiencing® is a body-oriented therapeutic approach that focuses on releasing trauma held in the body through awareness of sensations and movement."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the R.E.Body. Framework™ stands for Resilience. The framework emphasizes building resilience through addressing trauma."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "A client with a history of severe childhood abuse presents with significant dissociation. Which somatic approach would be LEAST appropriate to use initially?",
            "options": ["Gentle grounding exercises", "Focusing on present moment sensations", "Directly accessing traumatic memories", "Establishing a strong therapeutic alliance"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Directly accessing traumatic memories can overwhelm a client with dissociation and potentially lead to further dysregulation. Grounding, present moment focus, and a strong therapeutic alliance are more appropriate initial steps."

            "id": "q4_7",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that 50-60% of therapists working with trauma survivors report experiencing vicarious trauma, highlighting the importance of self-care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A therapist is experiencing symptoms of vicarious trauma, including increased irritability and difficulty sleeping. What is the MOST effective self-care strategy to implement?",
            "options": ["Working longer hours to feel more productive", "Isolating from social support to avoid burdening others", "Seeking supervision or consultation with a trauma-informed colleague", "Ignoring the symptoms and hoping they will resolve on their own"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Seeking supervision or consultation provides a safe space to process vicarious trauma and develop coping strategies. Ignoring symptoms or isolating oneself can worsen the impact."
        },

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "In integrating somatic trauma release into clinical practice, what is the MOST important ethical consideration?",
            "options": ["Convincing clients to embrace somatic techniques regardless of their preferences", "Practicing within one's scope of competence and training", "Guaranteeing complete resolution of trauma symptoms", "Avoiding any discussion of trauma history"],

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 35-year-old client, presents with chronic anxiety and flashbacks related to a car accident. During a session, she becomes highly agitated and reports feeling trapped. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate based on the principles of somatic trauma release?",
            "options": ["Encourage Sarah to immediately recount the details of the car accident", "Guide Sarah through a grounding exercise focusing on her breath and body sensations", "Suggest Sarah take medication to manage her anxiety symptoms", "Tell Sarah to suppress her emotions and focus on positive thoughts"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guiding Sarah through a grounding exercise will help regulate her nervous system and bring her back to the present moment. Recounting the accident in a highly agitated state could be re-traumatizing."
