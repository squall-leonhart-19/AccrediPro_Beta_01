            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of Somatic Trauma Release (STR)?",
            "options": ["A purely cognitive approach to processing traumatic memories.", "A method focused on suppressing uncomfortable bodily sensations.", "A body-centered approach that facilitates the release of trapped survival energy and promotes nervous system regulation.", "A technique that relies solely on verbal processing of traumatic events."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "STR is a body-centered approach that helps release trapped survival energy and regulate the nervous system, moving beyond solely cognitive or verbal processing."

            "question": "According to the R.E.Body Framework™, what does the 'R' stand for?",
            "options": ["Repression", "Resourcing", "Regression", "Reaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the R.E.Body Framework™, 'R' stands for Resourcing, which involves identifying and utilizing internal and external resources to support nervous system regulation and trauma processing."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client reports feeling 'frozen' and unable to move during a session. According to the lessons, which trauma response is MOST likely being activated?",
            "options": ["Fight", "Flight", "Freeze", "Fawn"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'freeze' response is characterized by immobility, dissociation, and a sense of being stuck or unable to act. This aligns with the client's described experience."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'tracking' in Somatic Experiencing?",
            "options": ["To analyze the client's past traumas in detail.", "To help the client avoid uncomfortable bodily sensations.", "To observe and follow the client's moment-to-moment internal experience, including sensations, images, and emotions.", "To provide the therapist with a clear timeline of the traumatic event."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tracking involves carefully observing and following the client's internal experience as it unfolds in the present moment, without judgment or interpretation."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "A client consistently attempts to please the therapist and avoid conflict during sessions, even when discussing difficult material. This behavior is MOST indicative of which trauma response?",
            "options": ["Fight", "Flight", "Freeze", "Fawn"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'fawn' response involves seeking safety and connection by appeasing others, often at the expense of one's own needs and boundaries. The client's behavior aligns with this pattern."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "According to research cited in the module, what percentage of therapists report experiencing vicarious trauma?",
            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 20-30%", "Around 50%", "Over 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 20-30% of therapists experience vicarious trauma due to exposure to clients' traumatic experiences. This highlights the importance of self-care and preventative measures."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important aspect of establishing safety and rapport with a client before engaging in Somatic Trauma Release techniques?",
            "options": ["Immediately diving into the details of the traumatic event.", "Focusing primarily on cognitive restructuring of negative thoughts.", "Creating a safe and supportive environment where the client feels heard, understood, and empowered.", "Minimizing discussion of the trauma to avoid triggering the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and rapport is paramount in trauma work. A safe and supportive environment allows the client to feel secure enough to explore their experiences without feeling overwhelmed or re-traumatized."

            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "A therapist practicing STR notices they are feeling increasingly anxious and overwhelmed after sessions with a client who has experienced severe abuse. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue working with the client without seeking support to avoid abandoning them.", "Minimize contact with the client and avoid discussing sensitive topics.", "Seek supervision or consultation from a qualified professional and prioritize self-care practices.", "Assume that the client's progress will alleviate the therapist's distress over time."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Experiencing vicarious trauma is common, and seeking supervision, consultation, and prioritizing self-care are essential for maintaining the therapist's well-being and ensuring ethical practice."

            "id": "q8_9",

            "options": ["Forcing oneself to recall traumatic memories in detail.", "Engaging in grounding exercises such as feeling one's feet on the ground or noticing the breath.", "Isolating oneself from social support to avoid triggering emotional responses.", "Consuming large amounts of caffeine to stay alert and focused."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises are effective resourcing strategies that help to anchor individuals in the present moment and regulate the nervous system by connecting them to their physical sensations and surroundings."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "According to Dr. Levine's work (as discussed in the module), trauma is NOT primarily about the event itself, but rather about:",
            "options": ["The individual's cognitive interpretation of the event.", "The degree of physical injury sustained during the event.", "The unresolved survival energy that remains trapped in the nervous system.", "The amount of social support available after the event."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Levine's work emphasizes that trauma is not solely about the event, but about the body's inability to complete its natural survival responses, resulting in trapped energy and dysregulation."
