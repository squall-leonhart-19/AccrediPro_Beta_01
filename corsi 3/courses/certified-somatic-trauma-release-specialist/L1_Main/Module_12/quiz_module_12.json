            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY function of the social engagement system, according to Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["Activating the sympathetic nervous system for fight or flight.", "Down-regulating the dorsal vagal pathway to promote immobilization.", "Creating a sense of safety and connection to regulate physiological state.", "Triggering a freeze response in the face of overwhelming threat."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and dissociative during trauma processing. Which resourcing strategy would be MOST appropriate to implement FIRST?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to fully express their emotions.", "Grounding techniques like focusing on the sensation of their feet on the floor.", "Exploring the details of the traumatic memory.", "Using bilateral stimulation to process the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is overwhelmed, grounding techniques help bring them back to the present moment and create a sense of safety before attempting further processing."

            "question": "What is the key principle of titration in trauma processing?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves exposing the client to small doses of trauma-related material, allowing them to process it without becoming overwhelmed. This approach is based on the work of Peter Levine and is crucial for safety."

            "explanation": "Movement as integration aims to help clients release held tension, express emotions, and develop a greater sense of body awareness and regulation. It facilitates integration by allowing for the embodied processing of trauma."
