            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective initial strategy for reframing a client's limiting belief that 'I'm not strong enough for labor'?",
            "options": ["Directly contradicting the belief with positive affirmations.", "Exploring the origin of the belief and identifying supporting evidence.", "Suggesting a medically unnecessary C-section to avoid the perceived weakness.", "Ignoring the belief and focusing on physical exercise alone."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring the origin of the belief allows the client to understand the context and challenge its validity. As discussed in L1, understanding the root of the belief is crucial for effective reframing, a core principle of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which indicates that addressing underlying thoughts can significantly impact behavior and emotional response."

            "question": "A client is using visualization techniques for labor and delivery. She reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious during the visualizations. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to push through the anxiety to achieve the desired outcome.", "Suggest a different visualization technique or modify the existing one to be more manageable.", "Advise her to stop visualization altogether as it's clearly not working.", "Prescribe an anti-anxiety medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As taught in L2, if a technique is causing distress, it needs to be adjusted or replaced. Visualization should be a positive and empowering experience, not a source of anxiety. Adjusting the technique might involve shortening the duration, simplifying the imagery, or focusing on a different aspect of the labor process."

            "question": "According to Bandura's Self-Efficacy Theory, which of the following is the MOST influential source of self-efficacy beliefs for a pregnant woman preparing for childbirth?",
            "options": ["Verbal persuasion from her partner.", "Vicarious experiences of watching other women give birth.", "Mastery experiences of successfully managing pregnancy discomforts.", "Emotional and physiological states experienced during pregnancy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mastery experiences, or successfully accomplishing tasks, are the most powerful source of self-efficacy, as explained in L3. Successfully managing morning sickness, attending prenatal classes, or maintaining a healthy diet can all contribute to a woman's belief in her ability to handle labor and delivery."

            "question": "A client is unsure whether to opt for a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) or a repeat C-section. What is the MOST ethical and effective way to support her informed decision-making?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to choose the option that aligns with your personal beliefs about childbirth.", "Provide her with comprehensive information about the risks and benefits of both options, and help her clarify her values and preferences.", "Downplay the risks of VBAC to encourage a natural birth.", "Pressure her to choose the option that is most convenient for the hospital staff."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As covered in L4, supporting informed decision-making involves providing unbiased information and helping the client clarify her own values. This approach respects her autonomy and empowers her to make the best choice for herself and her baby. It's crucial to present evidence-based information on both VBAC and repeat C-sections, including success rates, risks of complications, and recovery times, enabling her to weigh the options according to her individual circumstances and preferences."

            "question": "A client is experiencing significant prenatal anxiety related to past trauma. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Encouraging her to immediately confront the trauma through detailed recounting.", "Referring her to a qualified mental health professional specializing in trauma-informed care.", "Minimizing her concerns and reassuring her that everything will be fine.", "Recommending she avoid discussing her past experiences altogether."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L5, complex emotional landscapes, especially those involving trauma, require specialized care. Referring the client to a mental health professional ensures she receives appropriate support and treatment. Trauma-informed care emphasizes safety, trust, and empowerment, which are essential for addressing the client's anxiety in a sensitive and effective manner."

            "options": ["Vulnerability: Acknowledging and processing past emotional wounds to promote healing.", "Values: Identifying and aligning actions with core personal values to enhance purpose and fulfillment.", "Visualization: Using mental imagery to prepare for labor and delivery.", "Validation: Providing constant reassurance and affirmation to boost self-esteem."],

            "explanation": "In the THRIVE Framework™, 'V' stands for Values. As explored in L6, aligning actions with core values provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment, contributing significantly to overall well-being. When a pregnant woman's decisions and behaviors are congruent with her values, she experiences greater satisfaction and reduced stress, enhancing her mental and emotional health."

            "explanation": "Reflective listening, as emphasized in L8, involves actively listening to the client, understanding her emotions, and reflecting back her feelings to validate her experience.

            "question": "A prenatal wellness coach is working with a client who has a history of anxiety. The client reports increased anxiety levels as she approaches her due date. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate action for the coach to take?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While supportive coaching and relaxation techniques can be helpful, a history of anxiety, especially when escalating, warrants referral to a mental health professional as discussed in L5. This ensures the client receives appropriate and specialized care for her anxiety, while the coach can continue to provide support and guidance within their scope of practice. Collaboration between the coach and mental health professional can provide comprehensive care for the client's well-being."

            "question": "In a case study discussed in L6, a client named Sarah, who was 35 years old and pregnant with her first child, successfully utilized the THRIVE Framework™ to manage her prenatal anxiety. Which element of the THRIVE Framework™ was MOST instrumental in helping Sarah challenge and reframe her limiting beliefs about childbirth?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While all elements of the THRIVE Framework™ contribute to overall well-being, the 'T - Thoughts' component directly addresses limiting beliefs. By identifying and challenging negative thought patterns related to childbirth, Sarah was able to reframe her beliefs and approach labor and delivery with greater confidence and positivity. This cognitive restructuring is a key aspect of managing anxiety and promoting emotional resilience, as highlighted in the case study."
