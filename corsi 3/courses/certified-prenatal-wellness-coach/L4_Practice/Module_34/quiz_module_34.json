            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element to consider when designing a prenatal wellness group program?",
            "options": ["The font size of the handouts", "The availability of childcare", "The specific needs and preferences of the target audience", "The length of each session"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Understanding and catering to the specific needs and preferences of the target audience is paramount for the success of any prenatal wellness program. Programs must be tailored to address their concerns, cultural backgrounds, and health conditions to ensure engagement and positive outcomes."

            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In a prenatal yoga workshop, a participant expresses discomfort with a particular pose. What is the MOST appropriate immediate response for the facilitator?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to push through the discomfort for optimal benefit.", "Offer a modification or alternative pose and check in with her privately later.", "Publicly demonstrate the correct posture to the entire group.", "Ignore the comment and continue with the planned sequence."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the safety and comfort of participants is paramount. Offering a modification or alternative pose ensures the participant can continue to engage safely while addressing their specific needs. A private check-in allows for further personalized support."

            "question": "Which marketing strategy is generally MOST effective for reaching pregnant women in a specific geographic area?",
            "options": ["Running a national television advertisement.", "Partnering with local obstetricians, midwives, and hospitals.", "Posting flyers in unrelated businesses.", "Sending out unsolicited emails."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Partnering with healthcare providers who regularly interact with pregnant women provides a direct and trusted channel for promoting prenatal wellness programs. This approach leverages existing relationships and ensures the message reaches the intended audience effectively."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "According to legal guidelines, what is the MOST important element to include in a consent form for a prenatal exercise program?",
            "options": ["A detailed list of all the facilitator's qualifications.", "A waiver of all liability for any potential injuries.", "A clear explanation of the program's activities, potential risks, and benefits.", "A statement that the participant agrees to attend all sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires participants to understand the nature of the program, its potential risks, and its benefits. This allows them to make an informed decision about their participation and protects both the participant and the facilitator."

            "question": "When adapting a prenatal nutrition workshop for a group of women with gestational diabetes, what adjustment is MOST important?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates from the meal plan.", "Focusing on blood sugar management, portion control, and appropriate carbohydrate choices.", "Increasing the recommended daily caloric intake.", "Ignoring their specific dietary needs and providing the standard nutrition information."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestational diabetes requires specific dietary modifications to manage blood sugar levels. Adapting the workshop to focus on these needs ensures the information is relevant and beneficial for participants with this condition."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of conducting post-program evaluations for prenatal wellness groups?",
            "options": ["To determine the facilitator's personal popularity.", "To gather data for future marketing materials.", "To assess the program's effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and measure participant satisfaction.", "To justify the program's cost to the organization."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Post-program evaluations provide valuable feedback on the program's impact, identify strengths and weaknesses, and help improve future iterations. They also measure participant satisfaction, which is a key indicator of program success."

            "id": "q34_7",
            "question": "In a group discussion, one participant consistently dominates the conversation. Which facilitation technique is MOST effective in addressing this situation?",
            "options": ["Directly telling the participant to be quiet.", "Ignoring the behavior and hoping it resolves itself.", "Using techniques like 'round robin' or 'parking lot' to ensure everyone has a chance to speak.", "Asking other participants to publicly confront the dominant individual."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Techniques like 'round robin' (where each person speaks in turn) or 'parking lot' (deferring off-topic discussions) create a structured environment that encourages participation from all members and prevents one person from dominating the conversation."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "A prenatal wellness program aims to reduce postpartum depression rates. A pre- and post-test survey reveals a <span class=\"highlight\">15%</span> reduction in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores among participants. What statistical measure would BEST determine if this reduction is significant and not due to chance?",
            "options": ["Calculating the average age of participants.", "Conducting a t-test or similar statistical analysis.", "Counting the number of participants who attended all sessions.", "Comparing the program's cost to the participant's income."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A t-test (or similar statistical test) compares the means of two groups (pre- and post-intervention) and calculates a p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the results if there is no real effect. A statistically significant p-value (typically <0.05) suggests the reduction in EPDS scores is likely due to the program and not random chance."

            "id": "q34_9",
            "question": "During a prenatal support group, a client reveals she is experiencing domestic abuse. What is the FIRST and MOST ETHICAL action the facilitator should take?",
            "options": ["Immediately call the police.", "Offer emotional support, ensure her safety, and provide information about local resources and reporting options.", "Advise her to leave the abusive relationship immediately.", "Share her situation with the rest of the group for support."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's safety and well-being is paramount. The facilitator should offer immediate emotional support, ensure she is in a safe environment, and provide information about resources like shelters, hotlines, and legal aid. Reporting to the police should only occur with the client's consent, unless there is an immediate threat to her life or the life of her unborn child."
        },
        {
            "id": "q34_10",
            "question": "In a case study presented in the lesson, a prenatal yoga program implemented a feedback system where participants anonymously rated each session on a scale of 1-5. The average rating consistently remained at 3.5. What is the MOST appropriate next step for the program facilitator?",
            "options": ["Assume the program is satisfactory and continue without changes.", "Discontinue the feedback system as it is not providing useful information.", "Conduct a more in-depth qualitative assessment (e.g., focus groups, interviews) to understand the reasons behind the average rating and identify specific areas for improvement.", "Increase the program fee to reflect its perceived value."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An average rating of 3.5 suggests there is room for improvement. A qualitative assessment can provide richer insights into the participants' experiences and identify specific areas where the program can be enhanced to better meet their needs and increase satisfaction. Quantitative data alone does not provide the 'why' behind the numbers."
