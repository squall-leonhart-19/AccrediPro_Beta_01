            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Defining a niche allows for highly targeted marketing, resonating deeply with a specific audience and leading to improved conversion rates. General marketing approaches are less effective."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Instagram, with its visual focus and large user base interested in health and wellness, is generally more effective for reaching a target audience interested in natural childbirth compared to LinkedIn (professional networking), Twitter (X) (news and trends), or TikTok (short-form video, broader audience)."

            "explanation": "Partnerships with healthcare providers like obstetricians and midwives provide credibility and access to a pre-qualified client base interested in prenatal wellness, leading to more effective client acquisition. It is unethical and illegal to offer medical advice without proper credentials."

            "options": ["Immediately lower the price", "Dismiss their concerns and emphasize the program's benefits", "Acknowledge their concerns, highlight the value and ROI, and offer flexible payment options if available", "Tell them your prices are non-negotiable"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing concerns with empathy, highlighting the value proposition, and offering flexible payment options is the most effective approach. Directly lowering the price without justification devalues the service."
