            "options": ["Immediately raise prices to reduce demand.", "Temporarily suspend marketing efforts and focus on fulfilling existing client commitments.", "Outsource coaching services to unqualified individuals to meet demand.", "Ignore the surge and maintain the current service level."],

            "explanation": "Temporarily suspending marketing allows the business to catch up with the increased demand, ensuring that existing clients receive the high-quality service they expect. This prevents overstretching resources and compromising quality. Raising prices or ignoring the surge could alienate potential clients or lead to burnout."

            "explanation": "A detailed independent contractor agreement is crucial to clearly define the relationship, responsibilities, payment terms, and ownership of intellectual property. This protects both the business and the contractor, minimizing potential legal disputes. A simple handshake or NDA alone is insufficient."

Monitoring these metrics allows you to determine if your marketing and sales strategies are cost-effective and if your clients are generating enough value over time to justify the investment in acquiring them. Gross revenue alone doesn't account for expenses, and client satisfaction, while important, doesn't directly measure financial performance."
