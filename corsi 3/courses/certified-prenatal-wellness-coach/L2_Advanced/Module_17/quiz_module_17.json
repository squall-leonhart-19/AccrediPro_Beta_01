            "question": "A client with a pre-existing anxiety disorder reports increased anxiety during the second trimester. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Immediately refer the client to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation.", "Suggest the client increase their caffeine intake to combat fatigue.", "Encourage the client to practice relaxation techniques and mindfulness exercises learned in previous sessions, and monitor symptoms.", "Discontinue all wellness coaching sessions until after delivery."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Encouraging relaxation techniques and monitoring symptoms is the most appropriate initial action. It aligns with the principles of non-pharmacological interventions and allows for a period of observation before considering more intensive measures. Referral is appropriate if symptoms worsen despite these initial steps."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client discloses a history of childhood trauma during a prenatal wellness session. According to research on trauma-informed care, what is the MOST important initial step?",
            "options": ["Immediately process the trauma with the client to facilitate healing.", "Establish safety and build trust in the therapeutic relationship.", "Encourage the client to immediately report the abuse to the authorities.", "Avoid discussing the trauma to prevent re-traumatization."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and building trust is paramount in trauma-informed care. This creates a secure environment for the client to explore their experiences at their own pace. Directly processing trauma without establishing safety can be re-traumatizing."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client experiences a miscarriage at 10 weeks gestation. Which of the following statements reflects the MOST appropriate and supportive response?",
            "options": ["'At least it happened early in the pregnancy.'", "'You can always try again.'", "'I'm so sorry for your loss. It's okay to grieve, and I'm here to support you.'", "'This probably happened because you weren't taking your prenatal vitamins regularly.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the loss and offering support is the most appropriate response. Minimizing the loss or offering unsolicited advice can be invalidating and unhelpful. Research indicates that acknowledging grief is a crucial step in the healing process following pregnancy loss."

            "options": ["Provide a strict meal plan and demand adherence.", "Explore the client's barriers to adherence and collaboratively develop realistic and sustainable strategies.", "Tell the client about the risks to the baby if she does not follow the diet.", "Discontinue coaching services, stating that her non-compliance is beyond your scope."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring barriers and collaboratively developing strategies is the most effective approach. This empowers the client and promotes long-term adherence. A 2021 study in the *Journal of Diabetes and Metabolism* found that collaborative goal-setting significantly improved glycemic control in gestational diabetes."

            "options": ["Dismiss her concerns, stating that preterm labor is rare.", "Provide her with statistics on preterm labor in twin pregnancies and discuss strategies for risk reduction, such as adequate rest and nutrition.", "Tell her that bed rest is the only proven way to prevent preterm labor.", "Suggest she terminate one of the pregnancies to reduce the risk."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

A 2022 meta-analysis in *Obstetrics & Gynecology* highlighted the increased risk of preterm labor in twin pregnancies, but also emphasized the importance of proactive management."

            "options": ["To encourage her to discontinue MAT immediately to protect the baby.", "To provide support, encouragement, and education on healthy lifestyle choices, while coordinating with her medical team.", "To monitor her urine drug screens to ensure compliance with the MAT program.", "To act as her primary therapist, addressing the underlying causes of her addiction."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary role is to provide support and education while coordinating with the medical team. Wellness coaches are not qualified to manage addiction treatment directly. A collaborative approach ensures the client receives comprehensive care."

            "question": "A client confides that she is experiencing emotional abuse from her partner. What is the FIRST and MOST important step you should take?",
            "options": ["Immediately confront her partner about the abuse.", "Report the abuse to child protective services.", "Assess her immediate safety and provide resources for domestic violence support.", "Advise her to leave the relationship immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guaranteeing a specific birth outcome is an ethical violation. Wellness coaches cannot guarantee results and should only provide support within their scope of practice. Ethical guidelines emphasize honesty and realistic expectations."

            "explanation": "Creating a postpartum plan, connecting with support groups, and discussing preventative strategies with her healthcare provider is the most appropriate intervention.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Expressing concern and encouraging her to discuss safer alternatives with her healthcare provider is the most appropriate action.
