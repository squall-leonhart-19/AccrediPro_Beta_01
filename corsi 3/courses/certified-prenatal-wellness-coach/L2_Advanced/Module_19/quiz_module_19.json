            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element in evidence-based practice for prenatal wellness coaching?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on expert opinions.", "Integrating client preferences with the best available research.", "Following traditional practices without question.", "Prioritizing personal anecdotes over scientific data."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice emphasizes the integration of best research evidence, client values, and clinical expertise. Ignoring any of these components undermines the process."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "You are searching for research on the effects of mindfulness on prenatal anxiety. Which database would be the MOST appropriate starting point?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed", "Wikipedia", "A popular parenting blog"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed is a database specifically focused on biomedical literature, making it ideal for finding research on health-related topics like prenatal anxiety and mindfulness."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in prenatal wellness research?",
            "options": ["To describe the experiences of a specific group of pregnant women.", "To establish a causal relationship between an intervention and an outcome.", "To explore a new area of research.", "To summarize existing research on a topic."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs are designed to determine cause-and-effect relationships through random assignment of participants to different groups (intervention vs. control)."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A research study reports a p-value of 0.06. What does this indicate regarding the statistical significance of the findings?",
            "options": ["The results are highly statistically significant.", "The results are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.", "The results are not statistically significant at the conventional p < 0.05 level.", "The p-value is irrelevant to statistical significance."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 means there is a 6% chance of observing the results if there is no real effect. This is above the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In a cohort study examining the relationship between prenatal exercise and gestational diabetes, what is the key characteristic of the study design?",
            "options": ["Participants are randomly assigned to exercise or control groups.", "Researchers follow a group of pregnant women over time to see who develops gestational diabetes.", "Researchers interview women who already have gestational diabetes about their past exercise habits.", "Researchers conduct a survey to assess the prevalence of gestational diabetes in a population."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cohort studies follow a group of people forward in time to observe who develops a particular outcome (in this case, gestational diabetes), allowing researchers to examine risk factors."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "You are creating a coaching plan for a client who is experiencing severe nausea in her first trimester. Based on research, which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate to suggest?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training.", "Acupuncture and ginger supplementation.", "A very restrictive diet to avoid triggering nausea.", "Complete bed rest."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that acupuncture and ginger supplementation can be effective in reducing nausea during pregnancy. Other options are generally not recommended or may be harmful."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is a key ethical consideration when applying research findings to prenatal wellness coaching?",
            "options": ["Implementing interventions without the client's informed consent.", "Presenting research findings in a way that is easily understandable and avoids causing undue anxiety.", "Only using research that confirms your own personal beliefs.", "Guaranteeing specific outcomes based on research results."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It is crucial to ensure clients understand the potential benefits and risks of any intervention and that they give their informed consent before proceeding. Overstating the certainty of research findings can also be unethical."

            "options": ["Identify flaws in individual research studies.", "Increase the statistical power and precision of the overall estimate of an effect.", "Develop new research hypotheses.", "Replace the need for conducting original research."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses pool data from multiple studies to provide a more robust and precise estimate of an effect, increasing statistical power."

            "question": "In the case study presented, a 32-year-old client named Sarah successfully managed her gestational diabetes through dietary changes and moderate exercise. What type of evidence does this represent?",
            "options": ["Systematic review", "Randomized controlled trial", "Case study/anecdotal evidence", "Meta-analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A case study represents anecdotal evidence based on the experience of a single individual. While valuable, it is not as strong as evidence from larger, controlled studies."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Staying current requires actively seeking out new information from credible sources, such as journals, conferences, and continuing education programs."
