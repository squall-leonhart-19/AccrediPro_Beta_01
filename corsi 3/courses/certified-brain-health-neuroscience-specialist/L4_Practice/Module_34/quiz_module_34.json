            "id": "q34_2",
            "question": "In the context of group dynamics, what does 'parking lot' refer to?",
            "options": ["A physical location for participants to take breaks", "A designated area to store materials", "A technique for managing off-topic discussions by noting them for later", "A method for resolving conflicts immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'parking lot' technique is used to acknowledge and defer off-topic discussions, ensuring the group stays focused. This prevents derailing the main agenda and allows for a more efficient use of time."

            "options": ["Balance", "Resilience", "Activity", "Interactions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness exercises primarily target resilience by helping individuals manage stress and build emotional regulation skills, which are core components of resilience as defined in the BRAIN framework."

            "options": ["A lecture on memory enhancement techniques", "A group activity involving repeated name recall and association", "Providing a written list of participants' names", "Encouraging participants to use name tags throughout the workshop"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active recall and association techniques are more effective than passive methods like lectures or lists. A group activity promoting repeated name recall actively engages participants and strengthens memory encoding."

            "id": "q34_6",
            "question": "To ensure a smooth logistical flow for a brain health workshop with 30 participants, what is the recommended participant-to-facilitator ratio to effectively manage group activities and provide individual support?",
            "options": ["30:1", "15:1", "10:1", "5:1"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A ratio of 10:1 allows facilitators to effectively manage group activities, provide personalized support, and address individual questions, ensuring a more engaging and beneficial experience for all participants. This is important to help the participants feel more supported in their learning."

            "options": ["Collecting attendance records", "Administering pre- and post-program cognitive assessments and surveys", "Gathering informal feedback from participants", "Tracking social media engagement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using both cognitive assessments and surveys offers a comprehensive approach by combining objective measures of cognitive function with subjective feedback on participants' experiences and perceptions of the program's impact. According to the lesson, this provides a well-rounded evaluation of program effectiveness."
