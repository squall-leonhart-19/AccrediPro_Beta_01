            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical initial step in managing a patient presenting with acute stroke symptoms?",
            "options": ["Administering a high dose of intravenous corticosteroids.", "Obtaining a detailed family medical history.", "Rapid neurological assessment and activation of the stroke protocol.", "Initiating physical therapy to prevent muscle atrophy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rapid neurological assessment and stroke protocol activation are crucial to minimize brain damage and improve patient outcomes in acute stroke management. Time is brain."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A 75-year-old Alzheimer's patient presents with acute agitation and aggression. Initial de-escalation strategies are unsuccessful. According to guidelines discussed in the neurodegenerative crises lesson, which pharmacological intervention is GENERALLY considered LEAST appropriate as a first-line treatment?",
            "options": ["Low-dose atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone).", "Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil).", "Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) for short-term crisis management.", "Non-pharmacological interventions like redirection and environmental modification."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cholinesterase inhibitors are not typically used for acute agitation management in Alzheimer's; they are used for cognitive symptom management. Atypical antipsychotics or benzodiazepines might be considered in severe cases after non-pharmacological options."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A patient with a history of Parkinson's disease is admitted to the emergency department with severe rigidity, fever, and altered mental status. This presentation is MOST consistent with:",
            "options": ["Serotonin syndrome.", "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS).", "Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (PHS).", "Acute dystonic reaction."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (PHS) is a potentially life-threatening complication of Parkinson's disease characterized by rigidity, fever, and altered mental status, often triggered by abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic medications."

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on psychiatric crises with neurological comorbidities, which of the following neurological conditions is MOST commonly associated with an increased risk of suicide?",
            "options": ["Migraine with aura.", "Multiple sclerosis.", "Epilepsy.", "Traumatic brain injury."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a well-established association with increased risk of suicide due to neurological damage and psychological sequelae.  Studies show a 2-4 times higher risk compared to the general population."

        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A patient is brought to the emergency room exhibiting symptoms of psychosis, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and agitation. Toxicology screening is positive for methamphetamine. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial management strategy?",
            "options": ["Administration of naloxone.", "Immediate lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis.", "Supportive care and symptomatic management of agitation.", "Prescription of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supportive care, including monitoring vital signs, managing agitation with benzodiazepines if necessary, and ensuring patient safety, is the priority in stimulant-induced psychosis. Naloxone is for opioid overdose."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "In advanced neuroimaging interpretation, FLAIR sequences are particularly useful for identifying which of the following in the context of a neurological crisis?",
            "options": ["Acute hemorrhage.", "Early ischemic changes.", "Skull fractures.", "Calcifications."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) sequences are sensitive to changes in tissue water content, making them useful for detecting early ischemic changes, edema, and other subtle abnormalities that may not be visible on standard MRI sequences."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A patient with a known CYP2C19 polymorphism is prescribed clopidogrel following a stroke. Pharmacogenomic testing reveals they are a poor metabolizer. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue clopidogrel at the standard dose.", "Increase the dose of clopidogrel to compensate for reduced metabolism.", "Switch to an alternative antiplatelet agent that is not dependent on CYP2C19 metabolism.", "Administer vitamin K to enhance clopidogrel's effect."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 experience reduced conversion of clopidogrel to its active form, leading to decreased antiplatelet effect. Switching to an alternative agent like ticagrelor or prasugrel is recommended."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "You are treating a patient with severe TBI who is unable to make decisions regarding their care. Their family disagrees about the best course of treatment. Ethically, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Follow the wishes of the family member who is most vocal.", "Obtain a court order to determine guardianship.", "Consult the hospital ethics committee to facilitate a consensus decision.", "Discharge the patient to the family's care, allowing them to decide."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Consulting the hospital ethics committee allows for a neutral, multidisciplinary review of the case, ensuring that the patient's best interests are prioritized and that all relevant ethical considerations are addressed."

            "options": ["Encouraging staff to work overtime to cover staffing shortages.", "Discouraging staff from discussing their emotional experiences.", "Implementing regular debriefing sessions and promoting self-care practices.", "Eliminating opportunities for professional development to reduce workload."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular debriefing sessions, self-care promotion, and fostering a supportive work environment are crucial for mitigating burnout. These strategies help healthcare professionals process their experiences, manage stress, and maintain their well-being."

            "question": "A 60-year-old patient with a history of alcohol use disorder presents with Wernicke's encephalopathy. After initial treatment with thiamine, which of the following is the MOST important long-term management strategy?",
            "options": ["Discharge the patient without further intervention.", "Continue thiamine supplementation and address the underlying alcohol use disorder.", "Administer high doses of vitamin B12.", "Prescribe antipsychotic medication for potential psychosis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While thiamine is critical for initial treatment, addressing the underlying alcohol use disorder is essential to prevent recurrence and further neurological damage. Long-term thiamine supplementation is also necessary."
