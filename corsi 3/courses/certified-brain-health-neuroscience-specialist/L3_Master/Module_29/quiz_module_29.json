            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding neuroplasticity techniques beyond traditional methods?",
            "options": ["They primarily focus on rote memorization.", "They often incorporate modalities like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and neurofeedback.", "They are less effective than basic cognitive exercises.", "They avoid any form of sensory input."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced neuroplasticity techniques often leverage technologies like TMS and neurofeedback to directly influence brain activity and enhance plasticity, going beyond traditional cognitive exercises."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Genetic testing reveals a variant in the MTHFR gene. Which nutritional intervention would be MOST appropriate, considering gene-environment interactions?",
            "options": ["High doses of folic acid supplementation.", "Supplementation with 5-MTHF (methylfolate).", "A diet high in processed foods.", "Eliminating all B vitamins from the diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with MTHFR gene variants may have difficulty converting folic acid to its active form (5-MTHF). Supplementation with 5-MTHF directly addresses this issue and is generally more effective."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "According to research on sleep architecture, which stage of sleep is MOST crucial for memory consolidation?",
            "options": ["Stage 1 sleep (N1).", "Stage 2 sleep (N2).", "Slow-wave sleep (SWS, N3).", "REM sleep."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow-wave sleep (SWS, also known as Stage 3 sleep) is vital for consolidating declarative memories and overall cognitive restoration. REM sleep is crucial for emotional processing and procedural memory consolidation."

        {
            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "Which component of the Polyvagal Theory, as described by Dr. Stephen Porges, relates to social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal pathway.", "Sympathetic nervous system.", "Ventral vagal pathway.", "HPA axis."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal pathway is associated with social engagement, facial expressivity, and feelings of safety and connection. It allows for calm and regulated social interaction."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "What is a primary benefit of using gamification in cognitive training?",
            "options": ["It reduces client engagement.", "It increases the perceived difficulty of tasks.", "It enhances motivation and adherence.", "It eliminates the need for personalized feedback."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gamification increases motivation and adherence by making cognitive training more engaging and enjoyable. Points, rewards, and challenges can help clients stay committed to the training process."

            "options": ["Nutrition.", "Neurotransmitters.", "Neuroplasticity.", "Nervous System."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, 'N' stands for Neurotransmitters, highlighting their crucial role in brain function and overall well-being."

            "id": "q29_7",
            "question": "A client is experiencing cognitive decline following a traumatic brain injury. When considering ethical considerations, which of the following actions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Guaranteeing complete cognitive recovery.", "Providing interventions outside of your scope of practice if no other providers are available.", "Clearly communicating the limitations of interventions and potential outcomes.", "Sharing client information with family members without consent."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires transparency about the limitations of interventions. Guaranteeing outcomes or practicing outside your scope can be harmful and unethical. Client confidentiality is paramount."

            "question": "Which of the following marketing strategies is MOST likely to attract high-quality clients to a brain health practice?",
            "options": ["Posting generic health advice on social media.", "Offering free consultations to everyone who inquires.", "Creating targeted content that addresses specific brain health concerns.", "Relying solely on word-of-mouth referrals."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Targeted content demonstrates expertise and attracts clients who are specifically interested in the services offered. Generic advice and free consultations may not effectively qualify potential clients."

            "id": "q29_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 62, reports difficulty sleeping and decreased cognitive function. Sleep study data indicates a significant reduction in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Which intervention would be MOST appropriate to prioritize?",
            "options": ["Administering a stimulant medication.", "Recommending a daytime nap schedule.", "Implementing strategies to improve sleep hygiene and potentially referring for sleep apnea evaluation.", "Suggesting a high-sugar diet before bed."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing sleep hygiene and investigating potential sleep disorders like sleep apnea are the most appropriate initial steps to improve sleep quality and increase SWS. Stimulants and high-sugar diets are counterproductive."

        {
            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "A 2023 study by Miller et al. found that virtual reality (VR) based cognitive training showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30%</span> improvement in executive function in older adults compared to traditional paper-based exercises (p < 0.05). Which statement BEST reflects the application of this finding?",
            "options": ["VR training is universally superior and should replace all other cognitive exercises.", "VR training may be a valuable tool for enhancing executive function, but individual responses may vary.", "The study proves that paper-based exercises are completely ineffective.", "The study is irrelevant to clinical practice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the study suggests VR training can be effective, it's important to remember that individual responses to interventions vary. VR is a valuable tool, but not a universal solution, and further assessment is always required."
