            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity, according to the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, directly addresses the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A client presents with mild cognitive impairment and reports significant sleep disturbances. Which assessment tool is MOST appropriate for objectively evaluating their sleep patterns?",
            "options": ["Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)", "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)", "Electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep", "Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the PSQI is a useful subjective measure, an EEG during sleep provides objective data on sleep stages and potential sleep disorders contributing to cognitive impairment."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to research presented in the Nutritional Strategies for Cognitive Enhancement lesson, what is the recommended daily intake of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) for supporting cognitive function in older adults?",
            "options": ["Less than 250mg", "250-500mg", "500-1000mg", "Greater than 1000mg"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that a daily intake of 250-500mg of DHA can support cognitive function, particularly in older adults. Higher doses may be considered under medical supervision."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "A brain health program incorporates high-intensity interval training (HIIT). What is the PRIMARY neurological benefit expected from this type of exercise?",
            "options": ["Increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)", "Reduced inflammation in peripheral nerves", "Enhanced spinal cord flexibility", "Improved balance and coordination only"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "HIIT has been shown to significantly increase BDNF levels, which supports neuroplasticity and cognitive function. Studies indicate that BDNF increases by as much as 30% after HIIT sessions."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, reports chronic stress and difficulty falling asleep. Which stress management technique, integrated into a brain health program, would be MOST effective for promoting relaxation and improving sleep onset?",
            "options": ["Vigorous aerobic exercise before bed", "Mindfulness meditation practices", "Stimulating cognitive tasks before bed", "Consuming caffeine before bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation has been shown to reduce stress hormones and promote relaxation, making it effective for improving sleep onset and overall sleep quality. A 2014 meta-analysis found that mindfulness meditation improved sleep quality with an effect size of 0.62."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "Which cognitive training approach focuses on improving executive functions such as working memory, planning, and problem-solving?",
            "options": ["Sensory-motor training", "Process-based training", "Strategy-based training", "Attention training"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Process-based training specifically targets core cognitive processes, including executive functions, to enhance overall cognitive abilities. This training can improve working memory capacity by as much as 25% in some individuals."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "What is a PRIMARY advantage of incorporating digital tools, such as brain training apps, into a brain health program?",
            "options": ["Reduced need for qualified professionals", "Increased client engagement and adherence", "Elimination of the need for traditional paper-based assessments", "Guaranteed cognitive improvement for all users"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Digital tools can enhance client engagement and adherence by providing personalized, interactive, and convenient training options. Studies show that adherence rates can increase by 20-30% when using gamified digital platforms."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "A brain health program shows improvements in cognitive test scores but no change in client-reported quality of life. What should be the FIRST step in adapting the program?",
            "options": ["Discontinue the program immediately", "Focus solely on cognitive test scores", "Evaluate the program's impact on functional abilities and well-being", "Increase the intensity of cognitive training exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "It's essential to assess whether cognitive improvements translate into meaningful changes in daily functioning and overall well-being. The program should be adapted to address client needs and goals beyond test scores."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "In the case study of John, a 68-year-old with early-stage Alzheimer's, which combination of interventions showed the MOST promise in slowing cognitive decline?",
            "options": ["Medication alone", "Cognitive training and social engagement", "Dietary changes alone", "Intense physical exercise only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that a combination of cognitive training and increased social engagement was most effective in slowing cognitive decline in John, emphasizing the importance of a multi-faceted approach."

            "options": ["Initial program popularity", "Cost-effectiveness and accessibility", "The number of participants in the first cohort", "The use of cutting-edge technology only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cost-effectiveness and accessibility are crucial for ensuring that the program can be sustained over time and reach a wider audience. Programs that are too expensive or difficult to access are unlikely to be sustainable in the long run."
