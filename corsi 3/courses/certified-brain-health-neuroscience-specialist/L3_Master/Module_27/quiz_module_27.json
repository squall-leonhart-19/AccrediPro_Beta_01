            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 35-year-old professional musician reports experiencing increased performance anxiety and memory lapses during performances. Which brain health strategy would be MOST appropriate as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Mindfulness and meditation techniques", "Dietary supplementation with Ginkgo biloba", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness and meditation can help manage performance anxiety and improve focus, directly addressing the reported symptoms. Studies on musicians show that mindfulness reduces anxiety and enhances cognitive control."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Entrepreneurs and executives often face high-stress situations. According to the module, what is the primary neurobiological mechanism by which chronic stress impairs cognitive function?",
            "options": ["Increased serotonin production", "Reduced cortisol levels", "Hippocampal atrophy and impaired neurogenesis", "Enhanced synaptic plasticity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to elevated cortisol levels, which can damage the hippocampus, a brain region critical for memory and learning. This results in atrophy and impaired neurogenesis, negatively affecting cognitive function."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A study discussed in the Brain Health in Education lesson showed that implementing mindfulness practices in the classroom led to what percentage improvement in students' attention spans?",
            "options": ["5%", "10%", "15%", "20%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that mindfulness practices can improve attention spans by approximately 15%. This improvement is attributed to enhanced executive function and reduced mind-wandering."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle factors has the MOST significant impact on promoting cognitive resilience and independence in older adults, according to longitudinal studies?",
            "options": ["Genetic predisposition", "Regular physical exercise and social engagement", "Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids alone", "Playing video games"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies consistently show that regular physical exercise and social engagement are the most potent lifestyle factors for maintaining cognitive function in older adults. These activities promote neuroplasticity and reduce the risk of cognitive decline."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In neurorehabilitation, what is the primary goal of cognitive training exercises following a traumatic brain injury (TBI)?",
            "options": ["To completely restore pre-injury cognitive function", "To compensate for cognitive deficits and improve functional independence", "To prevent further brain damage", "To diagnose underlying neurological conditions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to help individuals compensate for cognitive deficits resulting from the TBI and improve their ability to perform daily activities independently. This involves strategies to enhance memory, attention, and problem-solving skills."

        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A client with a history of anxiety disorder is seeking brain health interventions. Which neurotransmitter system is MOST directly targeted by Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), a common medication for anxiety?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Norepinephrine", "Serotonin", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SSRIs primarily target the serotonin system by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, increasing serotonin levels in the brain. This helps regulate mood and reduce anxiety symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "According to the ethical considerations discussed in the module, what is the MOST important principle to uphold when working with vulnerable populations, such as individuals with cognitive impairments?",
            "options": ["Maximizing profit", "Ensuring informed consent and protecting autonomy", "Using the most advanced and experimental treatments", "Guaranteeing a positive outcome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent and protection of autonomy are paramount when working with vulnerable populations. This ensures that individuals understand the nature of the intervention, its potential risks and benefits, and have the right to make their own decisions."

            "options": ["Sensory discrimination training", "Working memory training (n-back tasks)", "Visual acuity training", "Motor coordination exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working memory training, such as n-back tasks, has been shown to improve executive functions like attention, focus, and strategic planning, which are crucial for executives facing complex decision-making scenarios."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A retired teacher, age 72, is experiencing mild cognitive decline and memory problems. Her family reports she is increasingly isolated. What combination of interventions would be MOST beneficial, based on the module's recommendations?",
            "options": ["Cholinesterase inhibitors alone", "Cognitive stimulation therapy, physical exercise, and social engagement", "Strict dietary restrictions and cognitive training apps", "Complete rest and avoidance of mentally stimulating activities"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A combination of cognitive stimulation therapy, physical exercise, and social engagement is the most beneficial approach for addressing cognitive decline and promoting well-being in older adults. This holistic approach targets multiple domains of brain health and helps maintain cognitive function and independence."
