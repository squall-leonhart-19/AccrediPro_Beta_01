            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important reason for conducting a baseline assessment in brain health?",
            "options": ["To generate revenue for the clinic.", "To establish a starting point for monitoring cognitive and lifestyle changes.", "To diagnose specific neurological disorders.", "To satisfy insurance requirements."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A baseline assessment provides a crucial reference point for tracking progress and identifying areas needing intervention. While diagnosis may occur later, the baseline sets the stage for personalized care."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client scores 22 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). According to MoCA guidelines, this score indicates:",
            "options": ["Normal cognitive function.", "Mild cognitive impairment.", "Moderate cognitive impairment.", "Severe cognitive impairment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A MoCA score of 22 typically indicates mild cognitive impairment. Scores range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function and a score of 26 or above is generally considered normal."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which dietary component has been MOST consistently linked to improved cognitive function in research studies?",
            "options": ["Saturated fats.", "Refined carbohydrates.", "Omega-3 fatty acids.", "Artificial sweeteners."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are essential for brain health and have demonstrated cognitive benefits in numerous studies. Research suggests that they support neuronal membrane function and reduce inflammation. A meta-analysis by Yurko-Mauro et al. (2010) showed significant cognitive improvements with omega-3 supplementation."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to the National Sleep Foundation, what is the recommended sleep duration for adults aged 26-64?",
            "options": ["4-6 hours.", "6-7 hours.", "7-9 hours.", "9-11 hours."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The National Sleep Foundation recommends 7-9 hours of sleep per night for adults aged 26-64. Insufficient sleep can negatively impact cognitive function, mood, and overall health."

            "question": "Which of the following is a validated tool used to assess anxiety symptoms?",
            "options": ["Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).", "Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).", "Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).", "Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a widely used and validated self-report questionnaire for measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. It assesses both physiological and cognitive aspects of anxiety."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A 70-year-old client, Sarah, reports feeling isolated since her spouse passed away. Which aspect of her life should be prioritized during the environmental and social engagement assessment?",
            "options": ["Her financial stability.", "Her access to transportation.", "Her level of social interaction and support.", "Her home's accessibility features."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social isolation is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and mental health issues, particularly in older adults. Prioritizing Sarah's social interaction and support systems is crucial for her well-being."

        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "After completing a baseline assessment, you identify that a client has significant deficits in executive functions. Which area of intervention should be prioritized?",
            "options": ["Improving memory recall.", "Enhancing processing speed.", "Strengthening decision-making and planning skills.", "Increasing vocabulary knowledge."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Executive functions encompass higher-order cognitive processes like decision-making, planning, and problem-solving. Addressing deficits in these areas can have a broad impact on daily functioning and independence."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "When documenting assessment findings, which of the following is MOST important to include?",
            "options": ["Subjective opinions about the client's personality.", "Raw scores from cognitive tests without interpretation.", "Specific, objective observations and standardized test scores with clear interpretations.", "Assumptions about the client's future cognitive trajectory."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Accurate and objective documentation is essential for effective communication and treatment planning. Include specific observations, standardized test scores, and clear interpretations to provide a comprehensive picture of the client's cognitive and functional status."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Client John, age 62, reports consuming primarily processed foods and sugary drinks. His MoCA score is 24, and he reports feeling stressed most days. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Immediately start him on a rigorous exercise program.", "Recommend a complete overhaul of his diet and stress management techniques, implemented simultaneously.", "Suggest small, gradual changes to his diet and stress management, such as adding one serving of vegetables per day and practicing deep breathing exercises.", "Prescribe a pharmaceutical intervention for anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Small, gradual changes are more sustainable and less overwhelming for clients. Starting with manageable steps, like adding one serving of vegetables and practicing deep breathing, can lead to long-term improvements in diet and stress levels. According to Gardner et al. (2014), incremental lifestyle changes are more effective than drastic overhauls."

            "question": "A client's baseline assessment reveals significant cognitive decline and suspected dementia. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin cognitive training exercises.", "Avoid informing the client of the findings to prevent distress.", "Discuss the findings with the client and their family, and refer them to a neurologist for further evaluation.", "Recommend over-the-counter memory supplements."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires transparency and collaboration. Discussing the findings with the client and their family, and referring them to a neurologist for further evaluation, ensures they receive appropriate medical care and support. Hiding the findings would be unethical and potentially harmful."
