            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of Hebbian learning, often summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together'?",
            "options": ["Meditation reducing amygdala activity", "Neurofeedback training enhancing alpha wave production", "Repeatedly practicing a musical instrument leading to improved dexterity", "Dietary changes improving gut microbiome diversity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hebbian learning describes the strengthening of connections between neurons that are activated simultaneously. Repeated practice strengthens the neural pathways involved in the skill."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A client presents with anxiety and difficulty focusing. Which biofeedback modality would be MOST appropriate to initially assess and potentially address these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Electromyography (EMG)", "Electroencephalography (EEG)", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EEG biofeedback directly measures brainwave activity, making it most relevant for addressing anxiety and focus issues. Different brainwave patterns are associated with different mental states."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the Gut-Brain Axis lesson, which of the following dietary interventions has demonstrated the strongest evidence for improving mood and cognitive function?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all gluten from the diet", "Consuming a diet rich in prebiotics and probiotics", "Following a strict ketogenic diet", "Adopting a vegan diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that prebiotics and probiotics can positively influence the gut microbiome, which in turn can impact neurotransmitter production and brain function via the vagus nerve. A 2023 meta-analysis showed significant mood improvements with probiotic supplementation."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "Which of the following stress management techniques focuses on altering negative thought patterns to reduce cognitive distortions?",
            "options": ["Diaphragmatic breathing", "Mindfulness meditation", "Cognitive restructuring", "Progressive muscle relaxation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring, a core component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), involves identifying and challenging negative thoughts to replace them with more balanced and realistic ones."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client reports consistently waking up feeling unrefreshed, despite getting 7-8 hours of sleep. Which advanced sleep optimization strategy should be explored FIRST?",
            "options": ["Using a weighted blanket", "Implementing blue light blocking glasses in the evening", "Undergoing a sleep study to rule out sleep disorders", "Taking a melatonin supplement before bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ruling out underlying sleep disorders like sleep apnea is crucial before implementing other strategies. Unexplained fatigue despite adequate sleep duration warrants medical evaluation."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which type of cognitive training exercise is MOST likely to improve working memory capacity?",
            "options": ["Sudoku puzzles", "Dual N-back training", "Crossword puzzles", "Learning a new language"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual N-back training specifically targets working memory by requiring individuals to simultaneously remember and update visual and auditory information. Studies have shown transfer effects to other cognitive domains."

        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, which element focuses on optimizing blood flow and oxygenation to the brain?",
            "options": ["Balance", "Resilience", "Activity", "Inputs", "Neuroplasticity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Activity' component of the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™ emphasizes physical activity and cardiovascular health to promote optimal cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, essential for brain function."

        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "A 65-year-old client is concerned about age-related cognitive decline. Based on emerging research, which intervention might be MOST promising for mitigating this decline?",
            "options": ["Taking a daily multivitamin", "Engaging in regular social interaction and cognitive stimulation", "Following a low-fat diet", "Taking a Ginkgo Biloba supplement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research increasingly highlights the importance of social engagement and cognitive stimulation in maintaining cognitive health and resilience in older adults. These activities promote neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve."

            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 42, reports chronic stress and digestive issues. Using the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, which combination of interventions would address both the gut-brain axis and stress resilience?",
            "options": ["Meditation and a high-sugar diet", "High-intensity exercise and processed foods", "Mindfulness and a diet rich in probiotics and prebiotics", "Sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in saturated fats"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness techniques reduce stress and modulate the HPA axis, while probiotics and prebiotics improve gut health, influencing neurotransmitter production and reducing inflammation, thus positively impacting the gut-brain axis."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "Which emerging technology holds the MOST promise for personalized brain health interventions in the future?",
            "options": ["Standardized cognitive assessments", "One-size-fits-all dietary recommendations", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning for data analysis", "Traditional paper-based questionnaires"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AI and machine learning can analyze vast amounts of data from various sources (e.g., genetics, lifestyle, cognitive assessments) to create highly personalized interventions tailored to an individual's specific needs and risk factors. This represents a significant advancement over generic approaches."
