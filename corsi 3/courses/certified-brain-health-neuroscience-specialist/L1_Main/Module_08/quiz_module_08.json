        {
            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique is MOST useful in identifying subtle cognitive deficits not captured by standard neuropsychological tests?",
            "options": ["Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)", "Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)", "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)", "Trail Making Test"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) provides real-time data collection in natural settings, allowing for the identification of cognitive fluctuations and subtle deficits often missed in controlled testing environments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "A client consistently dismisses positive feedback, attributing successes to luck. This is an example of which cognitive bias?",
            "options": ["Confirmation Bias", "Availability Heuristic", "Discounting Positives", "Anchoring Bias"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Discounting positives involves minimizing or dismissing positive experiences or feedback, often leading to a negative self-perception. This is a common cognitive distortion addressed in cognitive reframing techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Which SMART goal component is BEST exemplified by the statement, 'I will walk for 30 minutes, three times a week'?",
            "options": ["Specific", "Measurable", "Achievable", "Time-bound"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The statement is 'Specific' because it clearly defines the action (walking), duration (30 minutes), and frequency (three times a week) of the goal."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, approximately how long does it take for a new habit to become relatively automatic for most individuals?",
            "options": ["7 days", "21 days", "66 days", "90 days"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A study published in the European Journal of Social Psychology found that it takes an average of 66 days for a new habit to become automatic, although this varies significantly between individuals and habits."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced cognitive training techniques focuses on improving the brain's ability to process information quickly and accurately?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness Meditation", "Working Memory Training", "Speed-of-Processing Training", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Speed-of-Processing Training, often using dual n-back tasks or similar exercises, aims to enhance the brain's processing speed, which can improve overall cognitive function and reaction time."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client with the MTHFR gene variant may benefit MOST from supplementation with which form of folate?",
            "options": ["Folic Acid", "5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)", "Folinic Acid", "Tetrahydrofolate (THF)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with the MTHFR gene variant may have difficulty converting folic acid into its active form, 5-MTHF. Supplementation with 5-MTHF bypasses this conversion issue, ensuring adequate folate levels for brain health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Which type of dietary fiber is MOST effective in promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria that produce butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid crucial for brain health?",
            "options": ["Insoluble Fiber", "Resistant Starch", "Cellulose", "Lignin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistant starch is a type of carbohydrate that resists digestion in the small intestine and ferments in the large intestine, promoting the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria. Butyrate is a key energy source for colon cells and has anti-inflammatory effects that benefit the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the BRAIN framework, what does the 'I' stand for?",
            "options": ["Intelligence Enhancement", "Inflammation Management", "Immune Modulation", "Intrinsic Motivation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the BRAIN framework, 'I' stands for Inflammation Management, a critical component of brain health that involves reducing chronic inflammation through diet, lifestyle, and targeted interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "In a case study presented, a 62-year-old client with mild cognitive impairment showed improvement in executive function after implementing which intervention, in addition to dietary changes and exercise?",
            "options": ["Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)", "Cognitive Training Games", "Increased Social Interaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the positive impact of targeted cognitive training games on improving executive function in a 62-year-old client with mild cognitive impairment, complementing the benefits of dietary changes and exercise."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of using 'anchoring bias' to help a client change a deep-seated belief?",
            "options": ["Presenting the client with a single, compelling counter-argument.", "Encouraging the client to list all the evidence that supports their belief.", "Starting with a small, easily accepted change in belief and gradually increasing the challenge.", "Using emotional appeals to convince the client of a new perspective."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Anchoring bias can be used to help a client change a deep-seated belief by starting with a small, easily accepted change in belief and gradually increasing the challenge. By anchoring the client on a small change, it becomes easier to introduce greater shifts in belief as they become more comfortable with the initial alteration."
