        {
            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary mechanism by which neuroplasticity occurs?",
            "options": ["Synaptogenesis", "Long-term potentiation (LTP)", "Gliogenesis", "Apoptosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a normal biological process but not a primary mechanism of neuroplasticity. Synaptogenesis, LTP, and Gliogenesis all contribute to neuroplastic changes in the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A 55-year-old client, 'Jane', recovering from a stroke, exhibits difficulty with fine motor skills in her right hand. Which neuroplasticity-based intervention would be MOST appropriate to incorporate into her rehabilitation plan?",
            "options": ["Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the left motor cortex", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)", "Dietary changes focused on reducing inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "CIMT is specifically designed to improve motor function in affected limbs after a stroke by forcing the use of the weaker limb, promoting neuroplasticity in motor areas of the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of individuals with chronic pain experience significant pain reduction through neuroplasticity-based interventions like pain reprocessing therapy?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that approximately 50-60% of individuals with chronic pain report significant pain reduction when participating in neuroplasticity-based interventions like pain reprocessing therapy, which aims to rewire pain pathways in the brain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which type of biofeedback is MOST directly associated with enhancing focus and attention by training individuals to modulate specific brainwave frequencies?",
            "options": ["Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback", "Electromyography (EMG) biofeedback", "Neurofeedback (EEG biofeedback)", "Skin conductance biofeedback"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neurofeedback, also known as EEG biofeedback, directly targets brainwave activity, allowing individuals to learn to self-regulate their brainwaves to improve focus, attention, and other cognitive functions."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing persistent anxiety and digestive issues. Considering the gut-brain axis, what dietary recommendation would be MOST relevant to support neuroplasticity and improve both mental and gut health?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates", "Increasing intake of processed foods", "Consuming a diet rich in prebiotics and probiotics", "Focusing solely on high-protein intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in prebiotics and probiotics supports a healthy gut microbiome, which in turn can positively influence brain function and neuroplasticity through the gut-brain axis. This can help reduce anxiety and improve digestive health."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "When tailoring neuroplasticity interventions, what is the MOST important factor to consider to ensure personalized treatment?",
            "options": ["Following a standardized protocol for all clients", "Ignoring the client's preferences and goals", "Conducting a thorough assessment of the client's unique neurocognitive profile", "Relying solely on anecdotal evidence"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thorough assessment of the client's neurocognitive profile, including their strengths, weaknesses, and specific needs, is crucial for tailoring interventions that maximize their potential for neuroplastic change."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key ethical consideration when implementing neuroplasticity interventions, particularly those involving technology like TMS or tDCS?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the intervention is always administered by a licensed physician", "Obtaining informed consent and ensuring the client understands the potential risks and benefits", "Guaranteeing a 100% success rate", "Promising immediate and permanent results"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is paramount in neuroplasticity interventions. Clients must understand the potential risks, benefits, and limitations of the treatment before participating. Promising unrealistic outcomes is unethical."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "According to the module, what emerging technology shows promise for enhancing neuroplasticity by directly stimulating specific brain regions with greater precision than traditional methods?",
            "options": ["Virtual Reality (VR)", "Artificial Intelligence (AI)", "Focused Ultrasound (FUS)", "Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Focused Ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging technology that allows for precise stimulation of specific brain regions, offering potential advantages over traditional methods like TMS in terms of spatial resolution and depth of penetration."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A researcher is investigating the effects of a novel cognitive training program on working memory capacity. What neuroimaging technique would be MOST suitable for assessing changes in brain activity and connectivity associated with neuroplasticity following the intervention?",
            "options": ["X-ray", "Electroencephalography (EEG)", "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)", "Computed Tomography (CT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "fMRI is a neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. It is well-suited for assessing neuroplastic changes in response to cognitive training or other interventions."
