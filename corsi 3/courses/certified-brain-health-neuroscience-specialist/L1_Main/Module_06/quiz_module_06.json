            "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["The brain's ability to remain static and unchanging throughout life.", "The process of neuronal death that occurs with aging.", "The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.", "The irreversible decline in cognitive function due to genetic factors."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's remarkable ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life, allowing it to adapt to new experiences, learn new information, and recover from injury."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that approximately 30-40% of cognitive decline may be modifiable through lifestyle interventions, highlighting the significant impact of brain-healthy habits."

            "options": ["Specific", "Measurable", "Achievable", "Theoretical"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The SMART acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. 'Theoretical' is not a component of this framework."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, believes that her memory problems are solely due to genetics and that she cannot improve her cognitive function. Which of the following reframing techniques would be MOST effective in this situation?",
            "options": ["Agreeing with her belief to build rapport.", "Providing her with a list of medications to improve memory.", "Sharing research highlighting the role of lifestyle factors in brain health and neuroplasticity.", "Ignoring her belief and focusing solely on behavioral changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sharing research and evidence-based information about neuroplasticity and the impact of lifestyle factors can help challenge Sarah's limiting beliefs and empower her to take control of her brain health."

        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which cellular mechanism is most directly involved in long-term potentiation (LTP), a key process in neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["Apoptosis (programmed cell death)", "Increased synthesis of neurotransmitter receptors", "Myelination of axons", "Decreased blood flow to the brain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) strengthens synaptic connections, and this process critically involves increasing the synthesis and insertion of neurotransmitter receptors (particularly AMPA receptors) at the postsynaptic membrane."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "Which assessment tool is commonly used to screen for cognitive impairment and involves tasks such as naming objects and recalling a short list of words?",
            "options": ["Electroencephalography (EEG)", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)", "Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)", "Positron Emission Tomography (PET)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely used screening tool for cognitive impairment, assessing various cognitive domains including orientation, memory, and language."

            "options": ["Taking a daily multivitamin.", "Participating in a structured cognitive training program combined with regular physical exercise.", "Following a strict ketogenic diet.", "Listening to classical music for 30 minutes each day."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that a structured cognitive training program, combined with regular physical exercise, yielded the most significant improvements in cognitive scores for John after 6 months."

        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a 'brain-healthy' habit that promotes neuroplasticity and cognitive function?",
            "options": ["Staying up late to watch television.", "Consuming a diet high in processed foods.", "Engaging in regular aerobic exercise and mentally stimulating activities.", "Avoiding social interaction and isolating oneself."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular aerobic exercise and mentally stimulating activities have been shown to promote neuroplasticity, increase blood flow to the brain, and enhance cognitive function."
