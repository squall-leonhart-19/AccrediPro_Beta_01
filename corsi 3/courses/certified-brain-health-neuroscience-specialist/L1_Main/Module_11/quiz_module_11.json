            "question": "Which of the following best exemplifies Hebbian learning, often summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together'?",
            "options": ["A neuron decreasing its firing rate in response to repeated stimulation.", "Simultaneous activation of pre- and post-synaptic neurons leading to synaptic strengthening.", "The pruning of unused neural connections during adolescence.", "The release of inhibitory neurotransmitters to prevent over-excitation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hebbian learning posits that simultaneous activation of neurons strengthens their synaptic connection. This means that when a pre-synaptic neuron consistently contributes to the firing of a post-synaptic neuron, the connection between them becomes stronger."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, reports experiencing brain fog and digestive issues. Based on the principles of the gut-brain axis, which intervention would be MOST appropriate to initiate?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic to eliminate potential pathogens.", "Recommending a diet rich in fermented foods and prebiotics, along with stress-reduction techniques.", "Prescribing a high dose of NSAIDs to reduce potential gut inflammation.", "Suggesting a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet to minimize gut fermentation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis emphasizes the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. A diet rich in fermented foods and prebiotics can positively modulate the gut microbiome, potentially alleviating brain fog and digestive issues. Stress-reduction techniques further support a healthy gut-brain connection."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "Chronic activation of the HPA axis due to prolonged stress can lead to cognitive decline primarily through which mechanism?",
            "options": ["Increased production of neurotrophic factors like BDNF.", "Suppression of cortisol release, reducing its impact on the brain.", "Damage to the hippocampus due to prolonged exposure to elevated cortisol levels.", "Enhanced neurogenesis in the prefrontal cortex, compensating for stress-related damage."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolonged stress and HPA axis activation result in chronically elevated cortisol levels. This can damage the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory and learning, ultimately contributing to cognitive decline. A 2018 study in 'Nature Neuroscience' demonstrated this effect in animal models."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "During which stage of sleep is the glymphatic system MOST active in clearing metabolic waste products from the brain?",
            "options": ["Stage 1 Sleep", "Stage 2 Sleep", "REM Sleep", "Slow-Wave Sleep (Stage 3/4)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The glymphatic system, responsible for clearing metabolic waste from the brain, is most active during slow-wave sleep (Stages 3 and 4). This is when brain activity slows down, and cerebrospinal fluid can more effectively circulate and remove toxins."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key cytokine implicated in neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)", "Interleukin-1β (IL-1β)", "Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA)", "Dopamine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a significant role in neuroinflammation. Elevated levels of IL-1β in the brain have been linked to cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases."

            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary strategies is MOST effective in supporting brain health beyond general recommendations?",
            "options": ["Following a strict ketogenic diet with minimal carbohydrate intake.", "Prioritizing processed foods fortified with vitamins and minerals.", "Consuming a diet rich in polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants from whole foods.", "Adhering to a high-sugar diet to provide readily available energy for the brain."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants provides essential nutrients that support brain health by reducing inflammation, promoting neuroplasticity, and protecting against oxidative stress. These nutrients are best obtained from whole, unprocessed foods."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A cognitive training program designed to improve working memory should primarily target which brain region?",
            "options": ["The cerebellum", "The amygdala", "The prefrontal cortex", "The occipital lobe"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The prefrontal cortex is the primary brain region responsible for working memory. Cognitive training programs aimed at improving working memory should focus on exercises and activities that challenge and strengthen this area."

            "id": "q11_8",

            "options": ["Attention", "Action", "Awareness", "Appreciation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, 'A' stands for Action, representing the importance of physical activity and movement for optimal brain health and cognitive function."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Client John, 68, has mild cognitive impairment and struggles with recalling recent events. Based on the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, which combined intervention would be MOST effective?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a cholinesterase inhibitor medication alone.", "Implementing a structured cognitive training program, encouraging a Mediterranean diet, and incorporating regular aerobic exercise.", "Recommending complete social isolation to minimize distractions.", "Suggesting a diet high in saturated fats to improve brain energy metabolism."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive approach addressing multiple aspects of brain health is most effective. Combining cognitive training to target memory deficits, a Mediterranean diet to reduce inflammation and provide essential nutrients, and regular aerobic exercise to improve blood flow and neuroplasticity aligns with the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™."

            "question": "Which of the following statements regarding neuroplasticity is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["Neuroplasticity is limited to early childhood development.", "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.", "Neuroplasticity only occurs in response to traumatic brain injury.", "Neuroplasticity is solely dependent on genetic factors and cannot be influenced by environmental stimuli."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This process allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, learn new skills, and recover from injury. It is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors."
