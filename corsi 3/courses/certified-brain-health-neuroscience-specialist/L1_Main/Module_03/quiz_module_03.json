            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, which neurotransmitter plays a crucial role in reward-motivated behavior and is directly influenced by effective goal setting?",
            "options": ["Serotonin", "Dopamine", "GABA", "Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dopamine is heavily involved in the brain's reward system, and effective goal setting triggers its release, reinforcing positive behaviors."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, sets a goal to improve her memory. Which of the following SMART goal formulations is MOST effective according to the principles outlined in Lesson 2?",
            "options": ["Remember more things each day.", "Improve memory significantly.", "Recall 70% of items on a memory test within 3 months, using mnemonics for 15 minutes daily.", "Work on memory when feeling motivated."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most effective SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. 'Recall 70%...' meets all these criteria."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "In the context of personalized action plans, what is the PRIMARY benefit of conducting a thorough neuropsychological assessment?",
            "options": ["To identify the client's favorite activities.", "To determine the client's personality type.", "To pinpoint specific cognitive strengths and weaknesses to tailor interventions effectively.", "To predict the client's future career path."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuropsychological assessments provide a detailed profile of cognitive abilities, enabling the creation of targeted and effective interventions."

            "options": ["Saturated fats", "Refined sugars", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Processed carbohydrates"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are crucial for brain health, reducing inflammation and supporting neuronal function. Studies have shown their significant positive impact."

            "options": ["30 minutes", "75 minutes", "150 minutes", "300 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The recommended minimum is 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, as supported by numerous studies on cardiovascular and cognitive health."

            "options": ["Drinking alcohol before bed", "Using electronic devices until falling asleep", "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule", "Taking long naps during the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule helps regulate the body's natural circadian rhythm, promoting better sleep quality and overall brain health."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "In cognitive stimulation action plans, what is the key principle behind the effectiveness of activities like learning a new language or playing strategy games?",
            "options": ["Reducing stress levels", "Increasing physical activity", "Promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve", "Improving social interactions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "These activities challenge the brain, stimulating neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to reorganize itself) and building cognitive reserve, which helps protect against age-related decline."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "A client consistently fails to adhere to their exercise plan due to lack of motivation. Which of the following strategies is MOST likely to help them overcome this obstacle?",
            "options": ["Increasing the intensity of the exercise", "Switching to a more enjoyable activity and finding a workout buddy.", "Setting stricter deadlines and punishments for missed workouts", "Focusing solely on the long-term health benefits"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the lack of motivation by making the activity more enjoyable and incorporating social support is the most effective strategy for long-term adherence. Pairing with a buddy provides accountability and encouragement."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "Client John, age 68, is experiencing mild cognitive decline. His neuropsychological assessment reveals deficits in executive function. According to case study examples, which cognitive stimulation activity would be MOST appropriate to include in his action plan?",
            "options": ["Simple crossword puzzles", "Aerobic exercise", "Learning a complex musical instrument", "Watching educational documentaries"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Learning a complex musical instrument would challenge his executive functions (planning, problem-solving, working memory), promoting neuroplasticity and cognitive reserve, whereas crosswords may be too simple and documentaries are passive."
