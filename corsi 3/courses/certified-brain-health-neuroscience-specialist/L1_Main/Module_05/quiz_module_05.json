            "options": ["Astrogliosis", "Synaptic pruning", "Microglial activation", "Amyloid plaque formation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synaptic pruning is a crucial process where the brain eliminates weaker synaptic connections to strengthen more efficient ones, supporting learning and adaptation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate an average brain volume decrease of about 0.5-1% per year after age 60 if neuroplasticity isn't actively supported through lifestyle and cognitive interventions."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A 70-year-old client, 'Eleanor,' reports difficulty remembering names. Which cognitive training strategy is MOST likely to improve Eleanor's recall, based on neuroplasticity principles?",
            "options": ["Repeating the names silently multiple times", "Using spaced repetition with active recall", "Avoiding social situations to reduce name exposure", "Focusing on memorizing phone numbers instead"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spaced repetition with active recall leverages neuroplasticity by strengthening neural connections through repeated retrieval attempts over increasing intervals, improving long-term memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "Which type of physical exercise has been shown to have the most significant impact on neuroplasticity and cognitive function, particularly in the hippocampus?",
            "options": ["Isometric exercises", "Resistance training", "Aerobic exercise", "Flexibility training"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the release of neurotrophic factors like BDNF, which promotes neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."

        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which mindfulness meditation is believed to enhance neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["Increasing glial cell production in the cerebellum", "Decreasing blood flow to the prefrontal cortex", "Strengthening connections in the default mode network", "Promoting neurogenesis and synaptic connections in areas related to attention and emotional regulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation enhances neuroplasticity by strengthening neural connections in brain regions associated with attention, awareness, and emotional regulation, leading to improved cognitive and emotional control."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "Which nutrient is most directly involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, thereby supporting neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "B vitamins", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "B vitamins, particularly B6, B9 (folate), and B12, are crucial cofactors in the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which play a critical role in neuroplastic processes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "A study by Walker et al. (2002) demonstrated that sleep deprivation primarily impairs which aspect of neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["Long-term potentiation", "Synaptic pruning", "Neurogenesis", "Myelination"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Walker et al.'s research showed that sleep deprivation significantly impairs long-term potentiation (LTP), a critical mechanism for synaptic strengthening and memory consolidation during sleep."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Introducing <span class=\"highlight\">novelty</span> and <span class=\"highlight\">challenge</span> in daily routines fosters neuroplasticity primarily by:",
            "options": ["Reducing overall brain metabolism", "Stimulating the release of cortisol", "Activating the stress response to a manageable degree, promoting resilience", "Demanding the formation of new neural pathways and synaptic connections"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Novel and challenging experiences require the brain to adapt and learn, driving the formation of new neural pathways and strengthening existing connections, thus promoting neuroplasticity."

            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "Client 'Robert,' age 62, recently retired and feels isolated. Which intervention, based on the principles of social connection and neuroplasticity, would be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["Encouraging him to spend more time alone reading", "Recommending a solitary hobby like model building", "Facilitating participation in a group activity like a book club or volunteer organization", "Suggesting he focus on individual cognitive training exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Social interaction stimulates neuroplasticity by promoting the release of oxytocin and other neurotransmitters that support neural growth and connectivity. Group activities provide opportunities for meaningful social engagement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Based on the module's discussion of neuroplasticity, which statement best summarizes the long-term impact of consistent, multi-faceted efforts to nurture brain health?",
            "options": ["Neuroplasticity is primarily effective in children and adolescents.", "Neuroplasticity declines significantly after age 50, limiting the impact of interventions.", "Consistent efforts can maintain and even enhance cognitive function and resilience throughout the lifespan.", "Genetic factors are the primary determinant of cognitive aging, regardless of lifestyle choices."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While genetics play a role, consistent efforts to nurture brain health through lifestyle, cognitive training, and social engagement can significantly impact neuroplasticity, helping to maintain and enhance cognitive function and resilience throughout life."
