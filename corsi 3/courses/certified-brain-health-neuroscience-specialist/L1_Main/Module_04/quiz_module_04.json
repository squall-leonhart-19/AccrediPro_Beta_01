            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective strategy for building sustainable brain-healthy habits, based on the principles discussed in the course?",
            "options": ["Making drastic changes to your routine all at once.", "Focusing on perfection and avoiding any slip-ups.", "Starting with small, manageable changes and gradually increasing complexity.", "Relying solely on willpower and motivation to maintain new habits."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting small allows for easier integration and reduces the likelihood of feeling overwhelmed, fostering long-term adherence. A 2012 study by Wood and Neal highlighted that approximately 40% of our daily behaviors are habits, underscoring the importance of gradual integration."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports struggling to maintain her brain-healthy diet due to a lack of healthy options at work. What is the MOST appropriate first step in creating a supportive environment for her?",
            "options": ["Advising her to quit her job.", "Encouraging her to pack healthy meals and snacks for work.", "Suggesting she only eat at restaurants with healthy options.", "Telling her to rely on willpower to resist unhealthy temptations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Packing meals directly addresses the environmental barrier by providing healthy alternatives. This strategy aligns with research showing that pre-commitment strategies significantly improve dietary adherence."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Nutritional Integration, what is the recommended initial focus when helping a client transition to a brain-healthy diet?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating all processed foods and sugar.", "Prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods and adequate hydration.", "Calculating precise macronutrient ratios.", "Focusing solely on supplementation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods and hydration provides a solid foundation for brain health. A 2015 meta-analysis by Grosso et al. emphasized the importance of dietary patterns rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains for cognitive function."

            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "What is the minimum recommended amount of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week for promoting brain health, as suggested by the American Heart Association and discussed in the Exercise Integration lesson?",
            "options": ["15 minutes", "30 minutes", "75 minutes", "150 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week for overall cardiovascular and brain health. A study by Erickson et al. (2011) demonstrated that aerobic exercise increases hippocampal volume, which is vital for memory."

            "options": ["Using electronic devices before bed.", "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule.", "Consuming caffeine in the afternoon.", "Taking long naps during the day."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule helps to synchronize the body's internal clock with the external environment, promoting regular sleep patterns. Research indicates that disrupted circadian rhythms are associated with cognitive impairment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Learning a new language challenges the brain and requires the formation of new neural pathways, promoting neuroplasticity. Studies have shown that bilingualism is associated with improved cognitive function and delayed onset of dementia."
