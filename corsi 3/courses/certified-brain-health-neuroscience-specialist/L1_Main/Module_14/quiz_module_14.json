            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which chronic stress negatively impacts neuroplasticity in the aging brain?",
            "options": ["Increased production of neurotrophic factors", "Elevated levels of cortisol leading to synaptic pruning", "Enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus", "Improved glucose metabolism in the brain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress leads to elevated levels of cortisol, which can cause synaptic pruning and impair neuroplasticity in the aging brain. This effect is particularly pronounced in the hippocampus, affecting memory and learning."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which type of technology-based intervention has shown the MOST promise in enhancing neuroplasticity and cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)?",
            "options": ["Passive brain stimulation (e.g., tDCS) combined with cognitive training", "Virtual reality (VR) environments for spatial navigation training", "Smartphone apps for tracking daily activities", "Social media platforms for cognitive engagement"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that passive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), when combined with cognitive training, can significantly enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive function in individuals with MCI. This approach can help to strengthen neural connections and improve cognitive performance."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "According to the module, what is the primary way the gut microbiome influences neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["Directly altering brain structure through physical connections", "Producing neurotransmitters and metabolites that affect brain function", "Regulating blood pressure and heart rate", "Filtering toxins from the bloodstream"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiome influences neuroplasticity primarily by producing neurotransmitters and metabolites that can affect brain function. These substances can modulate synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and overall cognitive health."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A study cited in the module found that individuals with strong social connections had a 30% lower risk of developing dementia. What is the MOST likely mechanism explaining this protective effect?",
            "options": ["Increased physical activity due to social engagements", "Enhanced cognitive reserve and reduced inflammation", "Improved financial stability and access to healthcare", "Reduced exposure to environmental toxins"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Strong social connections are believed to protect against dementia by enhancing cognitive reserve and reducing inflammation. Social engagement provides mental stimulation, which strengthens neural networks, and reduces chronic inflammation, a known risk factor for cognitive decline."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, 'B' stands for Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is crucial for long-term neuroplasticity because it promotes neuronal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity, all of which are essential for maintaining cognitive health and adaptability."

Framework™ components simultaneously", "Focusing on one small, achievable change at a time, such as adding a 15-minute walk daily", "Completely overhauling his diet and exercise routine immediately", "Ignoring his concerns and emphasizing the importance of immediate, drastic changes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on one small, achievable change at a time is the most effective initial strategy. This approach allows clients to build momentum and confidence, making it easier to sustain long-term lifestyle modifications that support neuroplasticity."
