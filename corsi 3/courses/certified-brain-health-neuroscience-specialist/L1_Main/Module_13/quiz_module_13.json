            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which of the following neuroplasticity techniques focuses on strengthening neural connections by repeatedly pairing a specific sensory input with a desired motor output?",
            "options": ["Hebbian learning", "Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)", "Errorless learning"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian learning, often summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together,' emphasizes the strengthening of connections through repeated co-activation."

        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "According to research on flow state, what is the approximate percentage of challenge to skill level that typically facilitates the experience of flow?",
            "options": ["50% challenge, 50% skill", "75% challenge, 25% skill", "4% challenge, 96% skill", "96% challenge, 4% skill"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Optimal flow occurs when the challenge is slightly higher than the skill level, typically around 4% challenge over skill, creating a sense of stretched but manageable capability."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "Which glial cell type is primarily responsible for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain during neuroinflammation?",
            "options": ["Oligodendrocytes", "Astrocytes", "Microglia", "Ependymal cells"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain and are responsible for releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines when activated, contributing to neuroinflammation."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "During which stage of sleep does the majority of declarative memory consolidation occur?",
            "options": ["Stage 1 NREM sleep", "Stage 2 NREM sleep", "Slow-wave sleep (Stage 3 NREM)", "REM sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Slow-wave sleep (SWS), or Stage 3 NREM sleep, is crucial for the consolidation of declarative memories, such as facts and events."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed by anxious thoughts. Which mindfulness technique would be MOST appropriate to help them observe and detach from these thoughts without judgment?",
            "options": ["Loving-kindness meditation", "Body scan meditation", "Open monitoring meditation", "Focused attention meditation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open monitoring meditation encourages observing all thoughts and sensations without getting caught up in them, promoting detachment and non-judgmental awareness."

            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which cognitive training technique involves presenting stimuli at the edge of a person's perceptual abilities to improve processing speed and attention?",
            "options": ["Working memory training", "Dual n-back training", "Speed-of-processing training", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Speed-of-processing training, often using techniques like useful field of view (UFOV) training, aims to improve the speed and accuracy of visual attention and processing."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Estrogen has significant neuroprotective effects and promotes synaptic plasticity, influencing learning and memory in women."

            "question": "A 62-year-old client reports difficulty remembering names and faces. Based on the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, which of the following initial interventions would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a cholinesterase inhibitor", "Recommending a ketogenic diet", "Assessing sleep quality and addressing sleep apnea", "Initiating high-intensity interval training (HIIT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing and addressing sleep quality is a foundational step in the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, as sleep disturbances can significantly impact cognitive function."
