            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of Hebbian learning, often summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together'?",
            "options": ["Synaptic connections strengthen with repeated co-activation", "Long-term potentiation is a key mechanism", "It primarily affects glial cell activity", "It underlies associative learning"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hebbian learning primarily affects neuronal connections, not glial cells. It strengthens synapses that are repeatedly activated together, leading to long-term potentiation and associative learning."

        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "A client reports difficulty focusing and high stress levels. Which advanced mindfulness technique would be MOST appropriate to initially recommend?",
            "options": ["Vipassana meditation retreat", "Mindful Movement (e.g., Tai Chi)", "Non-dual awareness meditation", "Transcendental Meditation with mantra repetition"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindful Movement is generally a good starting point for individuals new to mindfulness or experiencing high stress, as it combines physical activity with mindful awareness, making it more accessible than seated meditation for some."

        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what is the estimated percentage increase in BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) levels observed after consistent, high-intensity interval training (HIIT)?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "10-20%", "20-30%", "30-40%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that consistent HIIT can increase BDNF levels by approximately 20-30%, contributing to neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Which of the following nutritional supplements has the strongest evidence for improving cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as discussed in the Advanced Nutritional Strategies lesson?",
            "options": ["Gingko Biloba", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)", "Vitamin B12", "Curcumin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While several supplements show promise, Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have the most robust evidence for supporting cognitive function in individuals with MCI."

        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "A client consistently wakes up between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM and struggles to fall back asleep. What advanced sleep optimization technique would be MOST appropriate to investigate FIRST?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)", "Chrono-nutrition strategies", "Blue light filtering glasses", "Melatonin supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "CBT-I addresses underlying cognitive and behavioral factors contributing to insomnia, making it a comprehensive approach. Investigating sleep-related anxiety and maladaptive sleep habits is crucial in these cases."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key component of the 'Acceptance and Commitment Therapy' (ACT) approach to stress management?",
            "options": ["Challenging negative thoughts", "Developing cognitive restructuring skills", "Accepting difficult thoughts and feelings without judgment", "Avoiding stressful situations"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ACT emphasizes acceptance of difficult thoughts and feelings, rather than trying to change them, and focuses on committing to values-based actions despite the presence of stress."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of 'n-back' training, a type of cognitive training program?",
            "options": ["Improving processing speed", "Enhancing working memory capacity", "Boosting crystallized intelligence", "Reducing impulsivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N-back training is specifically designed to challenge and improve working memory capacity by requiring individuals to continuously update and maintain information in their short-term memory."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "According to research on neuroplasticity, what is the estimated time window for optimal rehabilitation outcomes after a stroke?",
            "options": ["First 24 hours", "First 3 months", "First 6 months", "First year"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first 6 months after a stroke represent a period of heightened neuroplasticity, making it a critical window for intensive rehabilitation efforts to maximize functional recovery."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A client is implementing the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™. They've successfully addressed sleep, nutrition, and exercise. They are now focusing on 'Integration'. What advanced technique would be MOST relevant at this stage?",
            "options": ["Biofeedback for heart rate variability (HRV)", "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)", "Errorless learning strategies", "Gamma wave entrainment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is highly relevant for the 'Integration' stage of the B.R.A.I.N. Framework™, as it helps individuals become more aware of their thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, fostering a sense of wholeness and well-being."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "In the context of neuroplasticity, what does 'use it or lose it' refer to?",
            "options": ["The brain's ability to generate new neurons", "The weakening of unused neural connections", "The importance of maintaining cognitive reserve", "The role of genetics in brain health"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Use it or lose it' describes the principle that neural connections that are not actively used or stimulated tend to weaken and eventually be pruned, highlighting the importance of engaging in mentally stimulating activities to maintain cognitive function."
