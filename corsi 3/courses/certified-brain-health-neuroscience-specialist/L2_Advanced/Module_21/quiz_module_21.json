        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client presents with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) primarily affecting memory. According to the module's discussion on cognitive rehabilitation, which strategy would be MOST appropriate to implement FIRST?",
            "options": ["Errorless learning techniques for new information.", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Complete sleep deprivation for one night."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Errorless learning is highly effective for memory impairments, minimizing frustration and maximizing learning success, especially in early stages of MCI. The other options are either more invasive or less directly targeted at memory."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes that lifestyle interventions can potentially mitigate approximately 60% of cognitive decline risk, highlighting the significant impact of nutrition, exercise, stress management, and sleep."

            "options": ["Following a strict carnivore diet.", "Adhering to the Mediterranean diet.", "Intermittent fasting for 24 hours daily.", "Consuming only processed foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Mediterranean diet, rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates, has consistently shown strong evidence for cognitive benefits and neuroprotection."

        {
            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "According to research cited in the module, what type of exercise has been shown to have the greatest impact on hippocampal volume and memory function?",
            "options": ["Resistance training with heavy weights.", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Aerobic exercise such as brisk walking.", "Yoga and Pilates."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aerobic exercise, particularly activities like brisk walking, has been shown to increase hippocampal volume and improve memory function more effectively than other types of exercise, according to studies discussed in the module."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A client reports chronic stress and difficulty concentrating. Which mindfulness technique would be MOST appropriate to introduce initially, based on the module's recommendations?",
            "options": ["Vipassana meditation for 60 minutes daily.", "Body scan meditation for 10-15 minutes daily.", "Attending a silent retreat for 10 days.", "Engaging in competitive video gaming."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body scan meditation is a gentle and accessible mindfulness practice that can help individuals become more aware of their physical sensations and reduce stress, making it a suitable starting point."

        {
            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "What is the recommended sleep duration for optimal cognitive function in most adults, as emphasized in the module?",
            "options": ["4-5 hours per night.", "6-7 hours per night.", "7-9 hours per night.", "10-12 hours per night."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that 7-9 hours of sleep per night is crucial for optimal cognitive function, allowing the brain to consolidate memories and repair itself."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of Hebbian learning, a key principle in neuroplasticity?",
            "options": ["'Neurons that fire together, wire together.'", "'Neurons that fire separately, wire together.'", "'Neurons that don't fire at all, wire together.'", "'Neurons that fire randomly, wire together.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Hebbian learning, often summarized as 'neurons that fire together, wire together,' describes how repeated activation of neural pathways strengthens the connections between neurons, facilitating learning and memory."

            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' a 68-year-old with subjective cognitive decline, which intervention yielded the MOST significant improvement in her cognitive scores?",
            "options": ["Starting a new medication for anxiety.", "Implementing a comprehensive brain health program including diet, exercise, and cognitive training.", "Watching television for at least 4 hours daily.", "Isolating herself from social interactions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Sarah' case study highlighted the effectiveness of a comprehensive brain health program, demonstrating that a multi-faceted approach can lead to substantial cognitive improvements."

            "options": ["To completely reverse all cognitive decline.", "To encourage the brain to reorganize and form new neural connections.", "To eliminate the need for medication.", "To guarantee lifelong cognitive health."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to leverage the brain's inherent ability to reorganize and form new neural connections, thereby compensating for cognitive deficits and enhancing overall brain function."
