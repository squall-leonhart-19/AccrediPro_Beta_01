            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In a client with suspected Long COVID and cognitive dysfunction, which of the following initial assessment tools would be MOST appropriate to evaluate executive function?",
            "options": ["Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)", "Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)", "Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)", "Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - IV"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The MoCA is more sensitive than the MMSE in detecting mild cognitive impairment, which is often seen in Long COVID. While WAIS-IV is comprehensive, MoCA is often used as a screening tool."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 68-year-old client with Parkinson's Disease presents with increasing difficulty in planning and initiating movements. Which neurotransmitter system is MOST likely implicated in these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Acetylcholine", "Serotonin", "Dopamine", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parkinson's Disease is primarily characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to motor and cognitive deficits."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A 10-year-old child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibits significant challenges with social communication and repetitive behaviors. Which intervention strategy is MOST directly aimed at improving social interaction skills?",
            "options": ["Sensory Integration Therapy", "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)", "Occupational Therapy", "Speech Therapy focusing on articulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ABA is a widely used and evidence-based intervention for ASD that focuses on teaching and reinforcing adaptive behaviors, including social interaction skills."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A client with a history of severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is experiencing persistent memory impairments. Which of the following pharmacological interventions might be considered to improve cognitive function, specifically targeting memory consolidation?",
            "options": ["Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)", "Stimulants like Methylphenidate", "Cholinesterase inhibitors like Donepezil", "Benzodiazepines like Lorazepam"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cholinesterase inhibitors, often used in Alzheimer's disease, can sometimes be used off-label in TBI to improve memory by increasing acetylcholine levels, which are important for memory consolidation."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Ethical Considerations, which of the following is the MOST critical ethical consideration when working with clients who have cognitive impairments?",
            "options": ["Maximizing billable hours", "Ensuring client autonomy and informed consent", "Guaranteeing treatment success", "Prioritizing family wishes over client preferences"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ensuring client autonomy and obtaining informed consent are paramount ethical considerations, especially when cognitive impairments may affect the client's decision-making capacity."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client with a history of alcohol use disorder presents with difficulties in planning, problem-solving, and impulse control. Which brain region is MOST likely affected by chronic alcohol use, contributing to these executive function deficits?",
            "options": ["Cerebellum", "Hippocampus", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Amygdala"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The prefrontal cortex is highly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol, leading to impairments in executive functions such as planning, problem-solving, and impulse control."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "A client diagnosed with major depressive disorder is experiencing significant cognitive slowing and difficulty concentrating. Which neurotransmitter system is MOST likely implicated in these cognitive symptoms?",
            "options": ["Glutamate", "Histamine", "Endorphins", "Serotonin and Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Serotonin and norepinephrine are heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, and their dysregulation can contribute to cognitive symptoms such as slowed processing speed and impaired concentration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah', a 32-year-old with cognitive deficits following a mild TBI, which intervention showed the MOST significant improvement in her processing speed and attention according to the lesson?",
            "options": ["Mindfulness meditation", "Computerized cognitive training", "Physical therapy", "Dietary changes alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Computerized cognitive training, particularly programs targeting attention and processing speed, were highlighted as effective in improving Sarah’s cognitive function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client with suspected neurodegenerative disease presents with cognitive complaints. What is the FIRST step recommended in the lesson for a comprehensive assessment?",
            "options": ["Immediately prescribing medication", "Administering a detailed neuropsychological evaluation", "Obtaining a thorough medical history and physical exam", "Recommending lifestyle changes without further assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The first step is always to gather a comprehensive medical history and perform a physical exam to rule out other potential causes of cognitive decline before proceeding with more specialized testing."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "Considering the multifaceted approach to complex cognitive decline, which of the following combinations of interventions is MOST aligned with best practices, according to the course material?",
            "options": ["Pharmacological intervention alone", "Cognitive training, lifestyle modifications, and social engagement", "Exclusively focusing on memory rehabilitation", "Ignoring psychological factors in cognitive decline"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A holistic approach that combines cognitive training, lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise, diet), and social engagement is considered best practice for addressing complex cognitive decline due to its synergistic effects."
