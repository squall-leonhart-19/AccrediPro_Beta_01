            "question": "A 72-year-old client presents with memory complaints and is currently taking five different medications, including an anticholinergic for overactive bladder. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step to address potential cognitive impact?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the anticholinergic medication.", "Conduct a comprehensive cognitive assessment, including the MoCA.", "Recommend a brain MRI to rule out neurodegenerative changes.", "Prescribe a cholinesterase inhibitor to improve memory."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Conducting a comprehensive cognitive assessment, including the MoCA, is the MOST appropriate initial step. This helps establish a baseline and identify specific cognitive deficits before making changes to medication or ordering expensive imaging. Polypharmacy, especially involving anticholinergics, is known to negatively impact cognition, but a thorough assessment is needed first."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key early symptom often observed in individuals with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), distinguishing it from Alzheimer's disease?",
            "options": ["Progressive memory loss affecting recent events.", "Significant visuospatial deficits, such as getting lost in familiar places.", "Marked changes in personality, social behavior, and executive function.", "Gradual decline in language fluency and comprehension."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Marked changes in personality, social behavior, and executive function are key early symptoms of FTD. Unlike Alzheimer's, which primarily affects memory initially, FTD manifests with alterations in behavior and personality. This distinction is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management."

            "question": "A 45-year-old client with a history of multiple concussions sustained during sports activities reports persistent headaches, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Which cognitive rehabilitation strategy is MOST likely to be beneficial in addressing their symptoms?",
            "options": ["Administering high doses of omega-3 fatty acids.", "Implementing a structured program of cognitive rest and gradual return to activity.", "Prescribing stimulant medication to improve focus and attention.", "Encouraging immediate return to high-impact sports activities."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementing a structured program of cognitive rest and gradual return to activity is MOST likely to be beneficial. This approach allows the brain to heal and recover from the cumulative effects of concussions, while gradually reintroducing cognitive demands. Immediate return to activity or stimulant medication could exacerbate symptoms."

            "question": "According to a 2021 study by Raisi et al., what percentage of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit cognitive dysfunction, even during periods of remission?",
            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 20-30%", "Approximately 40-60%", "Greater than 70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2021 study by Raisi et al. indicated that approximately 40-60% of individuals with MDD exhibit cognitive dysfunction, even during periods of remission. This highlights the importance of addressing cognitive symptoms in the management of depression."

            "question": "Which modifiable cardiovascular risk factor has the strongest evidence linking it to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia?",
            "options": ["Elevated LDL cholesterol", "High blood pressure (hypertension)", "Elevated triglycerides", "Low HDL cholesterol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High blood pressure (hypertension) has the strongest evidence linking it to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Maintaining healthy blood pressure levels is crucial for preserving cognitive function."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reports experiencing 'brain fog' and difficulty with memory. Which of the following is the MOST likely mechanism contributing to cognitive impairment in this client?",
            "options": ["Direct invasion of the brain by RA-related antibodies.", "Chronic inflammation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "Structural damage to brain tissue caused by RA medications.", "Reduced cerebral blood flow due to joint pain and immobility."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic inflammation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are the MOST likely mechanism contributing to cognitive impairment in RA. These inflammatory mediators can disrupt neuronal function and impair cognitive processes."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "An 80-year-old client with significant hearing loss reports feeling overwhelmed and mentally fatigued after social gatherings. This is MOST likely due to:",
            "options": ["Age-related decline in cognitive processing speed.", "Increased cognitive load associated with processing degraded auditory information.", "Social isolation and lack of cognitive stimulation.", "Underlying neurodegenerative disease causing both hearing loss and cognitive decline."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increased cognitive load associated with processing degraded auditory information is the MOST likely reason. The brain must work harder to understand speech when hearing is impaired, leading to mental fatigue and reduced cognitive resources for other tasks."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "According to the B.R.A.I.N. framework, which element emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing underlying medical conditions that may contribute to cognitive impairment?",
            "options": ["Behavioral Strategies", "Restoration Techniques", "Activities and Engagement", "Investigative Assessment & Medical Management"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Investigative Assessment & Medical Management' element of the B.R.A.I.N. framework specifically addresses the need to identify and manage underlying medical conditions that can impact cognition. This includes conditions like polypharmacy, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disorders."

            "options": ["Errorless learning", "Constraint-induced movement therapy", "Goal Management Training (GMT)", "Sensory integration therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Goal Management Training (GMT) is specifically designed to improve executive functions, such as planning, organization, and problem-solving. It helps individuals develop strategies for managing distractions and staying focused on their goals."

            "question": "A 60-year-old client with type 2 diabetes reports increasing difficulty with memory and concentration. Based on current research, which intervention is MOST likely to benefit their cognitive function?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a cholinesterase inhibitor", "Initiating a strict ketogenic diet", "Implementing a program of regular aerobic exercise and dietary modifications to improve glycemic control", "Recommending cognitive training exercises alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Implementing a program of regular aerobic exercise and dietary modifications to improve glycemic control is MOST likely to benefit cognitive function. Studies have shown that improving glycemic control through lifestyle interventions can positively impact cognitive performance in individuals with type 2 diabetes."
