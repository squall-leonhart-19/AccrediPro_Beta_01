            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following research methodologies is considered the 'gold standard' for establishing cause-and-effect relationships in brain health interventions?",
            "options": ["Observational study", "Cross-sectional study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Case-control study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RCTs are considered the gold standard because they involve random assignment of participants to intervention and control groups, minimizing bias and allowing for causal inferences."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A researcher finds a p-value of 0.06 in their study examining the effect of a new cognitive training program on working memory. How should this result be interpreted?",
            "options": ["The result is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.", "The result is statistically significant at the p < 0.10 level.", "The result is not statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.", "The result proves that the cognitive training program is ineffective."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed effect is not statistically significant at that level. It does not 'prove' ineffectiveness, just that the evidence is not strong enough to reject the null hypothesis."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a systematic review and meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["To conduct a single, large-scale study on a specific topic.", "To summarize and synthesize the findings of multiple individual studies on a specific research question.", "To provide anecdotal evidence from clinical practice.", "To explore emerging research areas without rigorous methodology."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses aim to provide a comprehensive and unbiased summary of existing research by systematically identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the findings of multiple relevant studies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In evidence-based practice, what are the three key components that should be integrated when making clinical decisions?",
            "options": ["Researcher opinion, client preference, cost-effectiveness.", "Best available research evidence, clinical expertise, client values and preferences.", "Traditional practices, anecdotal evidence, expert consensus.", "Personal beliefs, marketing claims, convenience."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice emphasizes integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and client values/preferences to provide optimal care."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of 15 RCTs (n=742) found that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a small but significant improvement in cognitive function (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.45) in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. What does the effect size (SMD = 0.25) indicate?",
            "options": ["A very large effect, suggesting a strong clinical benefit.", "A moderate effect, suggesting a noticeable clinical benefit.", "A small effect, suggesting a limited clinical benefit.", "No effect, as the confidence interval includes zero."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An SMD (standardized mean difference) of 0.25 is generally considered a small effect size. While statistically significant, the clinical benefit may be limited."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 62, is interested in improving her memory. She read an article claiming a new brain training app significantly boosts cognitive function. What critical appraisal question is MOST important to consider before recommending the app?",
            "options": ["Is the app expensive?", "Who funded the research on the app?", "Does Sarah enjoy using technology?", "Does the app have appealing graphics?"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Funding sources can introduce bias. Knowing who funded the research helps assess potential conflicts of interest and the objectivity of the findings. While the other options are relevant, assessing potential bias is paramount."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which type of bias is MOST likely to occur when researchers selectively report only the positive outcomes of their study, while failing to mention non-significant or negative findings?",
            "options": ["Selection bias", "Publication bias", "Recall bias", "Attrition bias"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Publication bias refers to the tendency for studies with positive or statistically significant results to be more likely to be published than studies with negative or non-significant results, leading to an overestimation of the true effect size."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the primary difference between a cohort study and a case-control study?",
            "options": ["Cohort studies are prospective, while case-control studies are retrospective.", "Cohort studies are retrospective, while case-control studies are prospective.", "Cohort studies always involve an intervention, while case-control studies do not.", "Cohort studies are less prone to bias than case-control studies."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cohort studies follow a group of individuals (cohort) forward in time to observe the development of outcomes, while case-control studies compare individuals with a specific condition (cases) to individuals without the condition (controls) to identify past exposures or risk factors."

            "options": ["Single-blind study", "Double-blind study", "Open-label study", "Crossover study"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In a double-blind study, both the participants and the researchers are unaware of the treatment assignment, which helps to minimize bias from both parties."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which of the following databases is MOST suitable for finding systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to brain health interventions?",
            "options": ["PubMed", "Google Scholar", "Cochrane Library", "Web of Science"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Cochrane Library is a collection of databases that contain high-quality, independent evidence to inform healthcare decision-making. It is particularly known for its systematic reviews and meta-analyses of healthcare interventions."
