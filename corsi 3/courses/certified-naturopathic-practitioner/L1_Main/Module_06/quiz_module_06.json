            "question": "According to the VITAL Framework™, what is the primary purpose of exploring a client's Values & Vision?",
            "options": ["To quickly identify the client's presenting symptoms.", "To establish a foundation of intrinsic motivation for lasting change.", "To prescribe immediate dietary modifications.", "To analyze the client's family medical history."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding a client's core values and vision for their health creates a powerful internal drive that supports adherence to long-term lifestyle changes. As discussed in the lesson on 'V: Values & Vision,' aligning treatment plans with these intrinsic motivators significantly improves client outcomes."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "In the 'Investigate & Identify' stage of the VITAL Framework™, which of the following assessment methods is MOST emphasized?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Investigate & Identify' stage stresses a holistic assessment. This includes objective data (lab tests), subjective experiences (client history), and functional assessments (movement, digestion) to create a complete picture of the client's health status. Relying on a single data point is insufficient."

            "question": "During the 'Targeted Therapies' phase, what is the recommended approach to treatment planning?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Targeted Therapies' phase emphasizes personalized treatment plans. This means considering the client's specific assessment data, values, and preferences when selecting and implementing interventions. Standardized protocols are generally ineffective due to individual variability."

            "options": ["To ensure the practitioner maintains complete control over the client's treatment plan.", "To empower the client to take ownership of their health journey and actively participate in the healing process.", "To blame the client for any setbacks or lack of progress.", "To terminate the client-practitioner relationship once the initial symptoms subside."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Action & Accountability' stage is about fostering client empowerment. This involves helping clients develop self-efficacy, set realistic goals, and take responsibility for their health choices. It's about partnership, not control."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Long-Term Lifestyle' stage emphasizes sustainability. This means creating habits and practices that the client can realistically maintain over time. Restrictive diets and unsustainable interventions are counterproductive in the long run."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before implementing specific interventions, it's crucial to connect with Sarah's 'Values & Vision.' Understanding her deeper motivations will provide a foundation for sustainable change. Addressing adrenal fatigue or ordering lab tests may be relevant later, but establishing motivation is paramount."
