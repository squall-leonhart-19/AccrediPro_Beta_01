            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which dietary strategy is MOST effective for managing <span class=\"highlight\">histamine intolerance</span>, as highlighted in the 'Advanced Dietary Strategies' lesson?",
            "options": ["A high-FODMAP diet to promote gut diversity", "A ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation", "A low-histamine diet combined with DAO enzyme supplementation", "A vegan diet rich in plant-based proteins"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-histamine diet limits histamine intake, while DAO enzyme supplementation helps break down histamine in the digestive tract. This combined approach is more effective than other dietary strategies alone for managing histamine intolerance."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "According to the 'Botanical Medicine for Mental Wellness' lesson, which botanical is BEST supported by clinical evidence for reducing symptoms of mild to moderate <span class=\"highlight\">anxiety</span>?",
            "options": ["Ginseng (Panax ginseng)", "St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum)", "Kava (Piper methysticum)", "Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Kava has shown significant efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms in multiple clinical trials. While other botanicals may help with relaxation or mood, Kava has the strongest evidence base specifically for anxiety reduction."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client reports difficulty falling asleep and frequent nighttime awakenings. Which of the following sleep hygiene recommendations from the 'Optimizing Sleep Hygiene' lesson is MOST likely to improve their <span class=\"highlight\">sleep latency</span>?",
            "options": ["Taking a 2-hour afternoon nap", "Exercising vigorously right before bed", "Establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule, even on weekends", "Consuming caffeine after 6 PM"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A consistent sleep-wake schedule helps regulate the body's natural circadian rhythm, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. The other options disrupt sleep patterns."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "In the 'Targeting Inflammation' lesson, which supplement is highlighted as potentially beneficial for reducing <span class=\"highlight\">C-reactive protein (CRP)</span> levels, a marker of systemic inflammation?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Turmeric/Curcumin", "Magnesium", "Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown to reduce CRP levels in several studies. A 2017 meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in CRP with curcumin supplementation."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following detoxification strategies discussed in the 'Advanced Detoxification Strategies' lesson primarily supports the <span class=\"highlight\">lymphatic system</span>?",
            "options": ["Coffee enemas", "Infrared sauna therapy", "Chelation therapy", "High-dose vitamin C infusions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Infrared sauna therapy promotes sweating, which helps eliminate toxins through the skin and supports lymphatic drainage. Other strategies primarily target the liver or kidneys."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Initial lab tests reveal elevated TSH and low free T4. Based on the 'Hormone Balancing' lesson, which nutrient is MOST crucial for supporting <span class=\"highlight\">thyroid hormone</span> production?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Selenium", "Iron", "Vitamin B12"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for the conversion of T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) to T3 (active thyroid hormone). Insufficient selenium can impair thyroid function. While the other options are important for overall health, selenium is most directly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "According to the 'Microbiome' lesson, which type of prebiotic fiber is MOST effective at promoting the growth of <span class=\"highlight\">Bifidobacteria</span> in the gut?",
            "options": ["Resistant starch", "Inulin", "Cellulose", "Lignin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inulin is a fructan-type prebiotic fiber that selectively promotes the growth of Bifidobacteria, a beneficial genus of bacteria in the gut. Studies have shown that inulin supplementation can significantly increase Bifidobacteria populations."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome presents with multiple sensitivities and complex symptoms. According to the V.I.T.A.L. Framework™, what is the FIRST step in managing this complex case?",
            "options": ["Addressing the client's emotional well-being", "Identifying and addressing the client's individual vulnerabilities", "Implementing a comprehensive detoxification protocol", "Recommending a restrictive elimination diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The V.I.T.A.L. Framework™ prioritizes identifying and addressing individual vulnerabilities (V) as the first step in complex case management. This involves understanding the client's unique stressors, genetic predispositions, and environmental exposures."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "In the 'Targeting Inflammation' lesson, a case study described a patient with rheumatoid arthritis whose symptoms improved significantly after supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids. What is the PRIMARY mechanism by which omega-3 fatty acids reduce <span class=\"highlight\">inflammation</span>?",
            "options": ["Increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines", "Promoting the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes", "Inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme and reducing the production of inflammatory mediators", "Enhancing the activity of natural killer cells"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, inhibit the COX-2 enzyme, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This leads to a decrease in inflammation."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A client is experiencing persistent digestive issues after a course of antibiotics. Based on the 'Microbiome' lesson, which strategy would be MOST appropriate to restore <span class=\"highlight\">microbial balance</span>?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Recommending a high-sugar diet to feed beneficial bacteria", "Implementing a personalized probiotic protocol based on stool testing results", "Prescribing an anti-fungal medication"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personalized probiotic protocols, guided by stool testing, allow for targeted reintroduction of beneficial bacteria that may have been depleted by antibiotics. This approach is more effective than general probiotic recommendations and avoids unnecessary antibiotic or anti-fungal use."
