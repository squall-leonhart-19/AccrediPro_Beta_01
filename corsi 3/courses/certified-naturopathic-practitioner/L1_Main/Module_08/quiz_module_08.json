            "question": "In advanced case history taking, what is the primary goal of exploring a client's Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)?",
            "options": ["To assign blame for current health issues.", "To understand potential long-term impacts on the client's physiology and mental health.", "To prescribe specific medications based on the ACE score.", "To determine the client's eligibility for social services."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding ACEs helps uncover potential links between early trauma and current health challenges, allowing for a more holistic and trauma-informed approach to care."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "A client's DUTCH test reveals elevated levels of cortisol throughout the day. Which of the following lifestyle interventions would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high-intensity exercise program.", "Recommending adaptogenic herbs like Ashwagandha and Rhodiola.", "Implementing strict calorie restriction.", "Suggesting complete social isolation to minimize stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptogenic herbs can help modulate the stress response and support healthy cortisol levels, especially when combined with other stress-reducing lifestyle changes."

            "question": "According to the principles of personalized nutrition, what is a crucial consideration when recommending a ketogenic diet to a client?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the client consumes only animal products.", "Assessing the client's genetic predispositions and individual metabolic responses.", "Ignoring potential nutrient deficiencies as long as ketones are present.", "Assuming all clients will experience weight loss on a ketogenic diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Genetic variations (e.g., APOE status) and individual metabolic differences can significantly impact how a person responds to a ketogenic diet, necessitating personalized adjustments and monitoring."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Piperine in black pepper enhances the bioavailability and absorption of curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, leading to a greater anti-inflammatory effect. Studies show up to a 2000% increase in bioavailability."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing melatonin and cortisol levels throughout the day can reveal disruptions in the circadian rhythm, which are often associated with insomnia."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with MTHFR mutations may have difficulty converting folate into its active form (5-MTHF). Supplementing with activated folate bypasses this conversion issue and helps lower homocysteine levels."
