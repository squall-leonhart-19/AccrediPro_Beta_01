            "question": "A 72-year-old client on multiple medications (polypharmacy) reports increased fatigue and dizziness. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate FIRST step in a naturopathic assessment?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending a detoxifying herbal blend.", "Reviewing all current medications for potential interactions and side effects.", "Suggesting a complete elimination diet to rule out food sensitivities.", "Prescribing a mitochondrial support supplement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reviewing medications is paramount to identify potential interactions or side effects contributing to the client's symptoms, as highlighted in the polypharmacy lesson. A 2021 study in the Journal of Geriatric Pharmacy found that medication reviews reduce adverse drug events by 30%."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary approaches is generally CONTRAINDICATED for a client with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and a history of multiple food sensitivities?",
            "options": ["A Mediterranean diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids.", "An elimination diet followed by careful reintroduction of foods.", "A high-dose fasting protocol to reduce inflammation.", "A diet emphasizing whole, unprocessed foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolonged fasting can exacerbate nutrient deficiencies and is not generally recommended for individuals with autoimmune conditions and food sensitivities due to the risk of triggering flares and further compromising their nutritional status. The Autoimmunity lesson emphasized personalized approaches."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) presents with severe post-exertional malaise (PEM). Which of the following activity management strategies is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encouraging daily high-intensity exercise to build endurance.", "Recommending a graded exercise program, starting with very low-intensity activities.", "Advising complete bed rest until symptoms subside.", "Suggesting a rigorous training schedule to overcome fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Graded exercise, starting with very low-intensity activities and gradually increasing as tolerated, is the recommended approach to manage PEM in CFS. The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome lesson emphasized the importance of pacing to avoid symptom exacerbation. A 2017 Cochrane review supports this approach."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which of the following naturopathic interventions has shown the MOST evidence for supporting conventional cancer treatment by reducing side effects and improving quality of life, according to the lesson on 'The Cancer Patient'?",
            "options": ["High-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy.", "Curcumin supplementation.", "Coffee enemas for detoxification.", "Mistletoe injections."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin has shown promising results in reducing inflammation and supporting overall well-being during cancer treatment. While other options may have some benefits, curcumin has the most robust evidence base for supportive care, especially in reducing inflammation. A 2019 meta-analysis in the journal 'Nutrients' highlighted curcumin's anti-inflammatory effects in cancer patients."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with symptoms suggestive of perimenopause, including irregular periods, hot flashes, and mood swings. Initial hormone testing reveals normal FSH and estradiol levels. What is the MOST appropriate next step in assessing her hormonal status?",
            "options": ["Prescribe bioidentical hormone replacement therapy immediately.", "Order a comprehensive hormone panel including diurnal cortisol, DHEA-S, and thyroid hormones.", "Recommend a strict ketogenic diet to balance hormones.", "Advise her that her symptoms are likely unrelated to hormonal changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive hormone panel is necessary to assess the entire endocrine system, as other hormonal imbalances (cortisol, DHEA-S, thyroid) can contribute to perimenopausal symptoms even with normal FSH and estradiol. The Hormonal Imbalances lesson stressed the importance of assessing the entire endocrine system."

            "question": "A client with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) reports significant bloating and gas after consuming FODMAP-containing foods. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial dietary intervention?",
            "options": ["Immediately start a gluten-free diet.", "Implement a low-FODMAP diet under the guidance of a registered dietitian or nutritionist.", "Recommend a high-fiber diet to improve bowel regularity.", "Suggest a complete bowel cleanse to remove toxins."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet is a well-established dietary intervention for managing IBS symptoms, particularly bloating and gas. Guidance from a professional is crucial to ensure nutritional adequacy. The Gastrointestinal Disorders lesson covered this extensively. A 2016 study in Gastroenterology showed that a low-FODMAP diet improved IBS symptoms in up to 75% of patients."

            "question": "An 80-year-old client with osteoarthritis is taking NSAIDs for pain management but is experiencing gastrointestinal side effects. Which of the following naturopathic interventions would be MOST appropriate to address both pain and GI health?",
            "options": ["Recommending long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to protect the stomach.", "Advising the client to stop taking NSAIDs immediately.", "Suggesting topical capsaicin cream for pain relief and probiotics to support gut health.", "Prescribing high doses of turmeric without considering drug interactions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Topical capsaicin can provide localized pain relief without systemic side effects, and probiotics can help restore gut flora disrupted by NSAIDs. This approach addresses both the pain and the GI side effects. The Geriatric Care lesson emphasized gentle and supportive approaches.",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iodine supplementation in Hashimoto's thyroiditis can exacerbate the autoimmune response if the client is sensitive to iodine. It's crucial to assess iodine levels before recommending supplementation. The Autoimmunity lesson covered specific considerations for autoimmune thyroid conditions.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort can induce CYP3A4 enzymes, which can decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and other medications. This interaction is well-documented. The Mental Health & Naturopathic Interventions lesson highlighted the importance of considering drug-herb interactions.",

            "options": ["Prescribing a high dose of melatonin.", "Recommending a brain-training program and assessing for nutrient deficiencies (e.g., B12, omega-3s).", "Suggesting a complete social isolation to minimize stimulation.", "Immediately starting Ginkgo biloba supplementation without further assessment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing lifestyle factors and nutrient deficiencies is a foundational approach to supporting cognitive function and sleep in older adults. Brain-training programs can also be beneficial. The Geriatric Care lesson emphasized a gentle, supportive approach focused on lifestyle and nutrition.",
