            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In a case study involving Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and Fibromyalgia, which nutrient is MOST likely to be deficient and require supplementation, based on its critical role in thyroid hormone conversion and mitochondrial function?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Selenium", "Calcium", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is crucial for the enzyme that converts T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone. Deficiencies are common in Hashimoto's and can exacerbate fibromyalgia symptoms."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and muscle pain. Mold exposure is suspected. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step in assessing potential mold toxicity?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a broad-spectrum antifungal medication", "Ordering a urine mycotoxin test", "Initiating a gluten-free diet", "Recommending a high-intensity exercise program"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urine mycotoxin testing is a direct method to assess the presence of mycotoxins in the body, providing evidence of mold exposure and potential toxicity. While diet and exercise can be supportive, they don't directly address mold toxicity."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In managing a pediatric case of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with suspected gut dysbiosis, which intervention is LEAST likely to be beneficial in the initial stages?",
            "options": ["Probiotic supplementation", "Dietary changes to remove processed foods", "Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT)", "Introduction of fermented foods gradually"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FMT is a more advanced intervention typically considered after less invasive approaches, like dietary changes and probiotics, have been tried and have not yielded sufficient results. FMT carries risks and requires careful consideration."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson, which of the following advanced lipid markers provides the MOST specific information about the number of atherogenic particles?",
            "options": ["Total Cholesterol", "LDL-C (calculated)", "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)", "HDL-C"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ApoB is a direct measure of the number of LDL particles, each of which contains one ApoB molecule. This provides a more accurate assessment of atherogenic risk than calculated LDL-C."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A 32-year-old woman with PCOS is struggling with infertility. Besides lifestyle modifications, which of the following supplements has the strongest evidence for improving insulin sensitivity and ovulation rates?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids", "Myo-inositol", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Myo-inositol has been shown in multiple studies to improve insulin sensitivity, lower androgen levels, and improve ovulation rates in women with PCOS."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In managing andropause, which botanical medicine is MOST likely to improve prostate health and lower elevated estrogen levels?",
            "options": ["Saw Palmetto", "St. John's Wort", "Ginseng", "Chrysin"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chrysin is a natural aromatase inhibitor, helping to reduce the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. Saw Palmetto primarily addresses prostate symptoms but doesn't directly lower estrogen."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "During integrative cancer support, which of the following is generally considered the MOST important nutritional recommendation to minimize cancer cell growth?",
            "options": ["A high-carbohydrate diet", "A ketogenic diet", "A low-fat diet", "A high-protein diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A ketogenic diet, by severely restricting glucose, limits the primary fuel source for many cancer cells, potentially slowing their growth. This approach should be implemented under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "A patient with anxiety and depression also reports significant gastrointestinal distress. According to the lesson, what is the PRIMARY mechanism through which gut dysbiosis can contribute to these mental health conditions?",
            "options": ["Direct absorption of toxins into the brain", "Increased vagal nerve stimulation", "Altered neurotransmitter production and inflammation", "Decreased serotonin production in the brain"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gut dysbiosis can lead to increased inflammation and altered production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which are crucial for mood regulation. The gut-brain axis facilitates this communication."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A 50-year-old male presents with fatigue, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. His lab results show low free testosterone and elevated estradiol. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Testosterone replacement therapy", "Aromatase inhibitor", "Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)", "Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, stress reduction)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lifestyle modifications are always the first line of defense. Addressing diet, exercise, and stress can often improve hormone imbalances naturally before resorting to pharmaceutical interventions. Consider underlying causes such as obesity or sleep apnea."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "In a case of a child with ASD, which of the following dietary interventions has the MOST supporting evidence based on clinical trials for improving behavioral symptoms?",
            "options": ["Excluding all artificial colors and preservatives", "Implementing a strict vegan diet", "Supplementing with high doses of Vitamin C", "Following a gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Excluding artificial colors and preservatives has shown the most promise in reducing hyperactivity and improving focus in some children with ASD, based on clinical research. While GFCF diets can be helpful for some, the evidence is less consistent across all individuals with ASD."
