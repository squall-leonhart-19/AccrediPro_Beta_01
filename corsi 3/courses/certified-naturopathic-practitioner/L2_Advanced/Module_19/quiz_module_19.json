            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following databases is MOST suitable for finding systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to naturopathic interventions?",
            "options": ["PubMed", "Cochrane Library", "Scopus", "Web of Science"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cochrane Library is specifically designed for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, making it the most efficient choice for finding synthesized evidence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A researcher reports a p-value of 0.06 for a clinical trial investigating a herbal remedy for anxiety. What does this p-value suggest?",
            "options": ["The herbal remedy is highly effective in treating anxiety.", "There is a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups.", "The results are likely due to chance.", "The null hypothesis can be rejected."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is above the conventional significance level of 0.05, suggesting that the observed results are likely due to chance and not a real effect of the herbal remedy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In a case study presented in the lesson, a 45-year-old client named Sarah reported improved sleep quality after using a specific magnesium supplement. What is the PRIMARY limitation of using this case study as evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium for insomnia?",
            "options": ["Case studies are not relevant to clinical practice.", "The placebo effect cannot be ruled out.", "Magnesium is known to be ineffective for sleep.", "The client's age is a confounding factor."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case studies are susceptible to the placebo effect, where the client's belief in the treatment can influence the outcome, making it difficult to attribute the improvement solely to the magnesium supplement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "What is the key ethical consideration when conducting research involving vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women or children?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the research is cost-effective.", "Obtaining informed consent from all participants.", "Minimizing potential risks and maximizing benefits.", "Publishing the results quickly."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Protecting vulnerable populations requires a careful assessment of potential risks and benefits, ensuring that the research is ethically sound and minimizes harm."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which of the following study designs is considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention?",
            "options": ["Case series", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Cohort study", "Cross-sectional study"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard because they minimize bias through randomization and control groups, allowing for stronger causal inferences."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson, what is a major challenge in evaluating evidence for botanical medicine compared to pharmaceutical drugs?",
            "options": ["Botanical medicines are always more effective.", "Standardization of botanical products is often lacking.", "There is an abundance of high-quality research on botanical medicines.", "Botanical medicines are less expensive to study."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The lack of standardization in botanical products makes it difficult to ensure consistency in research and clinical applications, posing a significant challenge in evaluating their effectiveness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A meta-analysis reports a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.50-0.85 for a dietary intervention. How should this be interpreted?",
            "options": ["The intervention is harmful.", "The intervention is likely beneficial.", "The intervention has no effect.", "The intervention is only effective in specific populations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An odds ratio of 0.65 indicates a reduced odds of the outcome in the intervention group, and the confidence interval not crossing 1 suggests that this finding is statistically significant and likely beneficial."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What does 'NNT' stand for in evidence-based practice, and why is it clinically relevant?",
            "options": ["Number Needed to Treat; it indicates the number of patients who need to be treated to achieve one additional positive outcome.", "Necessary Nutritional Threshold; it represents the minimum dietary intake for optimal health.", "Nominal Number of Trials; it counts the number of studies on a specific intervention.", "Neural Network Technology; it is used to analyze complex datasets in clinical research."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is clinically relevant because it helps practitioners understand the practical impact of an intervention by indicating how many patients need to be treated to see one additional positive outcome."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",

            "options": ["Accepted without question.", "Disregarded entirely in favor of modern science.", "Critically evaluated and integrated with scientific evidence when appropriate.", "Used only as a last resort when modern medicine fails."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson emphasizes a balanced approach, where traditional knowledge is valued but also critically assessed and integrated with scientific evidence to ensure safety and effectiveness."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "When critically appraising a research study, what is 'publication bias' and how can it affect your interpretation of the evidence?",
            "options": ["The tendency for studies with positive results to be published more often than studies with negative results; it can lead to an overestimation of the intervention's effectiveness.", "The bias introduced by the journal's editorial board; it has minimal impact on the overall interpretation.", "The bias caused by using only publicly available data; it can lead to inaccurate conclusions.", "The bias resulting from the researcher's personal beliefs; it is easily corrected during peer review."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Publication bias can lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of an intervention because studies with positive results are more likely to be published, while studies with negative or null results may remain unpublished, skewing the available evidence."
