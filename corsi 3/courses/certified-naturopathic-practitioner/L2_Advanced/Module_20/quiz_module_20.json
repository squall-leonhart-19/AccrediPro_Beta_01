            "options": ["Comprehensive Stool Analysis.", "Organic Acids Test (OAT).", "Adrenal Stress Index.", "Heavy Metals Toxicity Test."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated homocysteine often indicates issues with methylation, a process assessed by an Organic Acids Test (OAT). The OAT can reveal deficiencies in B vitamins and other cofactors involved in methylation pathways, as discussed in L3 and L4."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While SIBO breath tests are important for SIBO, a Comprehensive Stool Analysis is considered the most thorough way to assess the overall gut microbiome, including bacterial balance, yeast overgrowth, and parasitic infections (L4)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Electroacupuncture according to Voll (EAV) is based on the concept of measuring electrical conductivity at acupuncture points to assess the energetic state of corresponding organs and systems, aligning with the principles discussed in L5."

            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old female presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Blood work reveals elevated TSH and low T4. Which additional assessment would provide the MOST comprehensive understanding of her thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Lipid panel.", "Complete Blood Count (CBC).", "Thyroid antibody testing (TPO and TgAb).", "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While TSH and T4 provide basic information, thyroid antibody testing (TPO and TgAb) is crucial for identifying autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's), a common cause of hypothyroidism, as discussed in the thyroid case studies within L8."
