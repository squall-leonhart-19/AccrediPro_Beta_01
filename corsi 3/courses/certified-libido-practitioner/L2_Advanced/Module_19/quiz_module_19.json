            "explanation": "The subjective and multifaceted nature of sexual desire presents a significant challenge in libido research due to the difficulty in creating objective and universally applicable measurement tools."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Beta-blockers are known to commonly contribute to decreased libido as a side effect, more so than ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The research on Tribulus terrestris is mixed. While some studies show benefits, particularly in individuals with pre-existing sexual dysfunction, the evidence is not conclusive for all individuals."

            "explanation": "When low libido is associated with relationship dissatisfaction, couples therapy that addresses communication and intimacy issues is often the most effective intervention, as it targets the underlying relational factors contributing to the problem.  Sensate focus, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness meditation can also be helpful, but are less directly targeted at the relational aspects."
