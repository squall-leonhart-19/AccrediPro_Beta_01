            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter, beyond dopamine, plays a critical role in the consolidation of sexual memories and the anticipation of sexual reward?",
            "options": ["Serotonin", "Norepinephrine", "Oxytocin", "Endocannabinoids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Oxytocin facilitates the consolidation of sexual memories and enhances the anticipation of sexual reward, contributing to the neurobiological underpinnings of desire. Studies show that oxytocin levels rise during sexual activity, reinforcing the rewarding aspects of these experiences."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of women report experiencing decreased libido during perimenopause, even when estrogen levels are supplemented?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "25-35%", "40-50%", "60-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 40-50% of women experience decreased libido during perimenopause despite estrogen supplementation, highlighting the complex interplay of hormones beyond estrogen in sexual desire."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A patient on SSRIs reports decreased libido. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention, assuming no contraindications?",
            "options": ["Prescribing testosterone supplementation", "Adding bupropion", "Recommending a higher dose of the SSRI", "Suggesting the patient discontinue the SSRI immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adding bupropion, an antidepressant with dopaminergic activity, is often an effective strategy to counteract SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Testosterone supplementation is generally not a first-line treatment for SSRI-induced libido issues in women, and abrupt discontinuation of SSRIs can lead to withdrawal symptoms."

            "question": "Which medical condition is MOST strongly associated with both decreased libido and erectile dysfunction due to its impact on vascular function and nerve damage?",
            "options": ["Hypothyroidism", "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)", "Multiple Sclerosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus significantly impacts vascular function and can cause nerve damage (neuropathy), leading to both decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction is significantly higher in individuals with diabetes compared to the general population."

            "question": "In the context of trauma-informed care for individuals with low libido, what is the primary goal of establishing a 'window of tolerance'?",
            "options": ["To encourage immediate exposure to traumatic memories", "To create a safe and regulated emotional space for processing trauma", "To suppress unwanted sexual thoughts and fantasies", "To rapidly desensitize the individual to triggers"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a 'window of tolerance' aims to create a safe and regulated emotional space where individuals can process traumatic experiences without becoming overwhelmed or shut down. This approach prioritizes safety and emotional regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In anxious-avoidant relationships with mismatched libidos, the anxious partner often seeks reassurance about their attractiveness, which can create pressure and resentment, further exacerbating the avoidant partner's withdrawal and contributing to sexual dissatisfaction."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
