            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial initial step when introducing mindfulness practices to a client with a history of trauma?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting with body scan meditations.", "Ensuring the client feels safe and in control of the pace and content.", "Encouraging the client to confront traumatic memories during meditation.", "Using guided imagery involving peaceful scenes to promote relaxation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety and control are paramount when working with trauma survivors.

            "question": "A client with social anxiety is engaging in mindfulness exercises. They report feeling overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts about potential social judgment. What is the MOST appropriate response?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness encourages non-judgmental awareness of thoughts. Attempting to suppress thoughts can paradoxically increase their frequency. Kabat-Zinn (1990) highlights the importance of observing thoughts as mental events without getting carried away by them."

            "explanation": "Gratitude meditations and savoring techniques, as explored by Fredrickson (2001), are effective in expanding positive emotions and building resilience in individuals with depression.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-care is an ethical imperative for therapists. Bride et al.
