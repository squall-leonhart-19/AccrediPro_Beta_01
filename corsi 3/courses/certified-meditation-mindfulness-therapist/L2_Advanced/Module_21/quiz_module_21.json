        {
            "id": "q21_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in establishing therapeutic goals with a client?",
            "options": ["Administering a standardized mindfulness questionnaire.", "Assessing the client's values, needs, and presenting problems.", "Immediately teaching mindfulness techniques.", "Reviewing the client's medical history."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing the client's values, needs, and presenting problems is paramount to ensure that therapeutic goals are aligned with the client's individual circumstances and motivations. This is more crucial than standardized questionnaires or immediate technique introduction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety when practicing open monitoring meditation. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to push through the discomfort, as it's a sign of progress.", "Suggest they switch to a focused attention technique, such as breath awareness, and reduce session length.", "Recommend they stop practicing meditation altogether.", "Increase the duration of the open monitoring meditation to build tolerance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Switching to a focused attention technique provides a more stable anchor for the client and may reduce anxiety. Reducing session length can also make the practice more manageable. Pushing through discomfort could be counterproductive, and stopping entirely isn't necessary."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "In structuring mindfulness-based therapy sessions, what is the recommended duration for the initial body scan meditation for a client new to mindfulness?",
            "options": ["45-60 minutes", "20-30 minutes", "5-10 minutes", "60-90 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A 20-30 minute body scan is generally recommended for beginners, providing sufficient time for exploration without overwhelming them. Longer durations may be challenging for new practitioners."

            "id": "q21_5",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaboratively identifying brief, accessible practices acknowledges the client's constraints and empowers them to integrate mindfulness realistically. This is more effective than drastic measures or blaming the client."
