            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety during Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM). Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial adjustment?",
            "options": ["Suggest they visualize a wider circle of recipients, including difficult people.", "Advise them to focus on their breath and reduce the duration of the meditation.", "Encourage them to push through the discomfort, as it indicates progress.", "Recommend they switch to a more complex mantra meditation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with focusing on the breath and shortening the meditation allows the client to regulate their emotional response before re-engaging with LKM. Pushing through discomfort or expanding the scope of the meditation could exacerbate anxiety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Movement-based practices can be particularly helpful for individuals with ADHD, as they allow for physical activity while maintaining a focus on the present moment. A study by Zylowska et al. (2008) showed positive effects of mindfulness training incorporating movement for adults with ADHD."

            "question": "During a Body Scan Meditation, a client expresses frustration that they cannot feel sensations in certain parts of their body. Which of the following is the MOST suitable response?",
            "options": ["Instruct them to try harder to feel something.", "Suggest they imagine the area being touched or gently tap the area.", "Tell them that this means there is a significant problem in that area.", "Immediately stop the meditation and switch to a different technique."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Imagining touch or gentle tapping can help bring awareness to the area without forcing sensation. It acknowledges the client's experience and provides a gentle way to explore body awareness."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle redirection is a core principle of mindfulness. Acknowledging the wandering mind without judgment and returning to the mantra builds focus and concentration."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focused attention meditation trains the mind to concentrate on a specific object (e.g., breath, mantra), whereas open monitoring meditation cultivates awareness of all thoughts, feelings, and sensations without getting carried away by them.
