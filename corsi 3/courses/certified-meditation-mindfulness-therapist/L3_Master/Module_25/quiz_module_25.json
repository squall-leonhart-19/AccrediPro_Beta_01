            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the primary role of supervision in mindfulness therapy?",
            "options": ["Administrative oversight of therapists' caseloads.", "Providing a safe and supportive space for therapists to explore their clinical work and personal experiences related to mindfulness practice.", "Enforcing strict adherence to specific mindfulness protocols.", "A purely didactic process of teaching mindfulness techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Supervision's core function is to offer a supportive environment for therapists to explore their clinical practice and personal experiences, fostering professional growth and ensuring client well-being. While administrative aspects and protocol adherence may be components, they aren't the primary focus."

            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "A supervisee reports feeling overwhelmed by vicarious trauma after working with a client who experienced significant childhood abuse. According to the Discrimination Model of Supervision, which area should the supervisor prioritize?",
            "options": ["Conceptualization: Helping the supervisee understand the client's trauma history.", "Intervention: Suggesting specific mindfulness-based techniques for the client.", "Personalization: Addressing the supervisee's emotional response to the client's trauma.", "Consultation: Seeking advice from a senior colleague about the client's case."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Discrimination Model emphasizes attending to the supervisee's feelings and reactions to the client. Addressing vicarious trauma falls directly within the Personalization role, as it focuses on the supervisee's emotional well-being and how their personal experiences are impacting their work."

            "question": "In the context of providing feedback, what does 'SBI' stand for, and how is it used?",
            "options": ["Subjective Behavioral Interpretation; used to personalize feedback.", "Situation Behavior Impact; used to structure constructive feedback.", "Specific Background Information; used to provide context for feedback.", "Systematic Bias Identification; used to identify potential biases in the therapist's approach."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'SBI' stands for Situation, Behavior, and Impact. It's a framework for delivering feedback by first describing the specific situation, then the observed behavior, and finally the impact of that behavior. This structure helps make feedback clear, specific, and less likely to be misinterpreted."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "A mindfulness therapist discloses to their supervisor that they are experiencing strong feelings of attraction towards a client. What is the MOST ethical course of action for the supervisor?",
            "options": ["Encourage the therapist to explore these feelings through personal therapy and consider transferring the client to another therapist.", "Suggest the therapist use mindfulness techniques to manage their feelings and continue working with the client.", "Advise the therapist to ignore the feelings and focus on the client's needs.", "Report the therapist to the ethics board immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Addressing feelings of attraction towards a client requires careful ethical consideration. The supervisor should prioritize the client's well-being by encouraging the therapist to seek personal therapy to understand their feelings and consider transferring the client to avoid potential boundary violations. Immediate reporting might be premature without exploring the situation further."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultivating self-awareness involves understanding one's own thoughts, feelings, and biases. Regular mindfulness meditation and journaling about personal reactions to clinical work directly promotes this self-reflection, allowing therapists to identify and address potential countertransference or emotional reactivity."

            "explanation": "Role-playing and direct instruction provide a practical and experiential learning opportunity for the supervisee to develop and refine their skills in applying mindfulness techniques with anxious clients. This hands-on approach is more effective than simply assigning readings or avoiding certain client populations."

Ignoring the behavior or discussing it with others without the supervisee's knowledge is unethical."
