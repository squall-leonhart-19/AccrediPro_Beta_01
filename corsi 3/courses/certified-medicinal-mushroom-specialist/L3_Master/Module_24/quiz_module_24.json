            "question": "Which client stratification approach is MOST appropriate for a new client presenting with mild anxiety and fatigue, according to the advanced assessment frameworks discussed?",
            "options": ["High-risk stratification requiring immediate intensive intervention", "Moderate-risk stratification requiring a comprehensive multi-modal approach", "Low-risk stratification suitable for basic lifestyle and dietary recommendations", "Unclear risk stratification, requiring extensive and costly diagnostic testing before proceeding"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with mild, common symptoms generally benefit from starting with low-risk interventions. Escalation is appropriate only if initial strategies are ineffective."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing vivid dreams and mild gastrointestinal discomfort after starting a high-dose Reishi mushroom protocol. What is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the Reishi protocol and refer to a specialist.", "Reduce the dosage of Reishi and monitor for symptom resolution.", "Maintain the current dosage, as these are expected detoxification symptoms.", "Add a liver support supplement to counteract the effects of Reishi."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mild side effects often resolve with dosage adjustments. Discontinuation is only necessary for severe or persistent adverse reactions."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "Which formulation strategy is MOST suitable for maximizing bioavailability of triterpenes from Reishi mushrooms, based on advanced extraction techniques?",
            "options": ["Simple hot water extraction", "Ethanol extraction followed by hot water extraction", "Powdered mushroom directly encapsulated", "Dual extraction using both hot water and CO2 extraction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethanol extraction is effective for triterpenes, while hot water extracts polysaccharides. Combining them provides a broader spectrum of beneficial compounds."

            "id": "q24_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on ethical considerations, what is the MOST ethical response to a client who insists on using medicinal mushrooms to replace their prescribed antidepressant medication, despite your recommendations?",
            "options": ["Agree to the client's request, as it is their right to choose their own treatment.", "Refuse to work with the client due to potential liability.", "Provide education on the risks and benefits of both approaches and document the client's informed decision.", "Contact the client's physician without their consent to express your concerns."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent and respecting client autonomy are paramount. Providing comprehensive information empowers clients to make informed decisions, even if they differ from your recommendations."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lion's Mane is known for cognitive support, and Cordyceps for energy enhancement, making this combination suitable for fatigue and brain fog."

            "id": "q24_6",
            "question": "Which of the following metrics is MOST useful for objectively monitoring the effectiveness of a medicinal mushroom protocol for a client with diagnosed anxiety, beyond subjective reports?",
            "options": ["Client's self-reported happiness levels", "Changes in social media activity", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and sleep quality data from wearable devices", "Frequency of phone calls with family members"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HRV and sleep data provide objective physiological measures that can correlate with improvements in anxiety symptoms. Self-reported measures are valuable but subjective."

            "id": "q24_7",
            "question": "In the context of functional medicine, how do medicinal mushrooms primarily support the 'methylation' process?",
            "options": ["Directly providing methyl groups", "Indirectly supporting methylation by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation", "Inhibiting methylation enzymes", "Having no impact on methylation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Medicinal mushrooms don't directly donate methyl groups but support methylation by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known to impair methylation pathways."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "When critically appraising a research study on medicinal mushrooms, which of the following factors is MOST important to consider regarding potential bias?",

            "options": ["The extract is guaranteed to lower blood pressure for all individuals.", "The extract has no statistically significant effect on blood pressure.", "The extract likely has a blood pressure-lowering effect, as indicated by the confidence interval not crossing zero.", "The extract is unsafe and should not be recommended."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A confidence interval that doesn't cross zero suggests a statistically significant effect. The range (5-11 mmHg) indicates the likely range of the blood pressure reduction."
