            "question": "Which of the following medicinal mushrooms is MOST associated with immune modulation during viral infections, based on in-vitro and in-vivo studies?",
            "options": ["Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)", "Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor)", "Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus)", "Chaga (Inonotus obliquus)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Turkey Tail contains Polysaccharide K (PSK) and Polysaccharide Peptide (PSP), which have demonstrated significant immunomodulatory effects, particularly in the context of viral infections. While other mushrooms offer immune benefits, Turkey Tail's PSK/PSP are particularly well-researched."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While medicinal mushrooms cannot cure neurodegenerative diseases, some species, like Lion's Mane, have shown potential in stimulating neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons) and providing neuroprotective effects, helping to slow down the progression of the disease."

            "question": "A 68-year-old client with Parkinson's disease is experiencing cognitive decline. Considering the potential benefits and limitations, which medicinal mushroom might be considered as a supportive adjunct, and why?",
            "options": ["Chaga, due to its high antioxidant content and potential to reverse neuronal damage.", "Lion's Mane, due to its potential to stimulate NGF production and support cognitive function.", "Cordyceps, due to its energizing effects and ability to cure Parkinson's disease.", "Reishi, due to its sedative properties and ability to completely eliminate tremors."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lion's Mane is a reasonable choice due to research suggesting its potential to stimulate NGF production, which may support cognitive function in individuals with neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease. It's important to note that it is used as a supportive adjunct, not a cure."

            "options": ["Simultaneously address both conditions with high doses of immune-modulating and neuroprotective mushrooms.", "Prioritize the autoimmune condition with aggressive immune-suppressing mushroom protocols.", "Focus solely on the trauma history and disregard the autoimmune component.", "Start with a very low dose of a single, well-tolerated mushroom, carefully monitoring for any adverse reactions, and addressing each condition separately in a step-wise manner in collaboration with other healthcare providers."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Given the complexities of autoimmune disease and trauma, a cautious and individualized approach is essential. Starting with a low dose of a single, well-tolerated mushroom allows for careful monitoring and minimizes the risk of exacerbating either condition. Collaboration with other healthcare providers is crucial for comprehensive and safe care."
