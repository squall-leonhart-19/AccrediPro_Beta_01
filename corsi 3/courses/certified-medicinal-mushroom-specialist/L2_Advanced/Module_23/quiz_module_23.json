            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which advanced extraction method is MOST effective for isolating non-water soluble compounds like triterpenes from medicinal mushrooms?",
            "options": ["Hot water extraction", "Ethanol extraction", "Dual extraction (water followed by ethanol)", "CO2 Supercritical extraction"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "CO2 Supercritical extraction uses carbon dioxide under pressure to act as a solvent, effectively extracting non-polar compounds like triterpenes, which are not soluble in water or ethanol alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson, what is the primary mechanism by which liposomal encapsulation enhances the bioavailability of mushroom compounds?",
            "options": ["Increased solubility in gastric fluids", "Protection from enzymatic degradation in the digestive tract", "Direct absorption into the bloodstream via lymphatic transport", "Enhanced binding affinity to intestinal receptors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Liposomes, being lipid-based vesicles, can be absorbed into the lymphatic system, bypassing first-pass metabolism in the liver and thus increasing bioavailability."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client with diagnosed anxiety and sleep disturbances expresses interest in medicinal mushrooms. Which of the following mushroom formulations would be MOST appropriate as a starting point, considering synergistic effects?",
            "options": ["Cordyceps single extract", "Reishi and Ashwagandha blend", "Lion's Mane and Bacopa Monnieri blend", "Chaga and Turmeric blend"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reishi is known for its calming properties, and Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that helps manage stress and improve sleep, creating a synergistic effect for anxiety and sleep issues."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "When cycling medicinal mushrooms, what is the typical recommended duration for an 'on' period before taking a break, as discussed in the dosing strategies lesson?",
            "options": ["1 week", "2-4 weeks", "6-8 weeks", "Continuously, with no breaks"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cycling protocols often recommend 6-8 weeks 'on' followed by 2-4 weeks 'off' to prevent tolerance and maintain efficacy."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Which of the following mushroom and herb combinations is BEST suited for supporting immune function during chemotherapy, based on discussed synergistic effects?",
            "options": ["Turkey Tail and Astragalus", "Shiitake and Ginkgo Biloba", "Maitake and St. John's Wort", "Reishi and Valerian Root"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Turkey Tail is known for its immunomodulating properties due to its polysaccharide content (PSK/PSP), and Astragalus is an adaptogen that supports immune function, potentially mitigating some side effects of chemotherapy. However, always consult with the patient's oncologist."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "A client reports gastrointestinal discomfort after starting a high dose of Chaga. What is the MOST appropriate initial course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue Chaga use", "Reduce the dosage and administer with food", "Administer an anti-diarrheal medication", "Increase water intake to flush out toxins"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gastrointestinal discomfort is a common side effect of high doses of certain mushrooms. Reducing the dosage and taking it with food can often mitigate these effects. Discontinuation should be considered if symptoms persist despite dosage adjustment."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Which lab test is MOST crucial for determining the level of heavy metal contamination in a batch of Reishi mushrooms?",
            "options": ["Beta-glucan analysis", "Triterpene quantification", "ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry)", "Polysaccharide content analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "ICP-MS is the gold standard for detecting and quantifying heavy metals in various substances, including medicinal mushrooms, ensuring product safety."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY ethical consideration when sourcing Cordyceps sinensis, given its traditional harvesting methods?",
            "options": ["Ensuring fair wages for harvesters", "Protecting the natural habitat from over-harvesting", "Verifying the authenticity of the species", "Minimizing the carbon footprint of transportation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Due to overharvesting and adulteration, verifying the authenticity of Cordyceps sinensis is paramount to ensure the product is genuine and ethically sourced. Lab-grown Cordyceps mycelium is often a more sustainable alternative."

            "question": "A client undergoing radiation therapy for cancer is interested in using medicinal mushrooms. Which mushroom should be approached with caution and ONLY used under close medical supervision due to potential interactions?",
            "options": ["Lion's Mane", "Reishi", "Turkey Tail", "Chaga"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chaga contains high levels of antioxidants, which theoretically could interfere with radiation therapy by protecting cancer cells. Therefore, it should be used with extreme caution and only under the direct supervision of the client's oncologist."

            "explanation": "Many medicinal mushrooms, such as Reishi (Ling Zhi), have a well-documented history of use within TCM, with applications aligned with TCM's holistic approach to health and disease. TCM practitioners often incorporate these mushrooms based on their energetic properties and effects on specific organ systems."
