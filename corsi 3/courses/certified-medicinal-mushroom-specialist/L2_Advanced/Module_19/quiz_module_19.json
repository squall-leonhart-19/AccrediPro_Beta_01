            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary goal of a meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["To conduct original research on a specific topic.", "To summarize and statistically analyze the results of multiple independent studies.", "To provide anecdotal evidence supporting the use of medicinal mushrooms.", "To replace clinical trials with in vitro studies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses statistically combine the results of multiple studies to increase statistical power and provide a more precise estimate of the true effect size."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons, what is a key limitation of relying solely on in vitro studies to support the use of medicinal mushrooms for human health?",
            "options": ["In vitro studies are always more reliable than clinical trials.", "In vitro studies do not account for the complex interactions within the human body.", "In vitro studies are too expensive to conduct.", "In vitro studies can perfectly mimic human physiology."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In vitro studies are conducted in controlled laboratory settings and lack the complexity of the human body, including immune system interactions and metabolic processes."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the context of clinical trials, what does 'blinding' refer to?",
            "options": ["Concealing the color of the medicinal mushroom being used.", "Preventing researchers and/or participants from knowing who is receiving the treatment and who is receiving the placebo.", "Using only participants who are blind.", "Hiding the study results from the public."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blinding is a crucial technique to minimize bias in clinical trials by ensuring that neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving the active treatment or the placebo."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a CONSORT statement in the context of clinical trial reporting?",
            "options": ["To provide a standardized way to report the results of clinical trials, ensuring transparency and completeness.", "To promote the use of specific medicinal mushrooms.", "To hide potential conflicts of interest in clinical trials.", "To replace peer review with automated reporting."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statements provide guidelines for reporting clinical trials, aiming to improve the completeness and transparency of trial reports."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A study with a p-value of 0.06 is considered:",
            "options": ["Statistically significant at the 0.05 level.", "Statistically significant at the 0.01 level.", "Not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.", "Definitely proving the hypothesis is correct."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 means there is a 6% chance of observing the results if the null hypothesis is true. Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is required for statistical significance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key element of informed consent in medicinal mushroom research?",
            "options": ["Providing participants with a detailed explanation of the study's purpose and procedures.", "Ensuring participants understand the potential risks and benefits of participating.", "Guaranteeing participants a positive outcome from the medicinal mushroom treatment.", "Allowing participants to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires providing participants with a clear understanding of the study, potential risks, and their right to withdraw. Guaranteeing a positive outcome is unethical and unrealistic."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A systematic review includes a search strategy described as 'grey literature search'. What does this MOST likely include?",
            "options": ["A search of only journals with grey covers.", "A search of unpublished studies, reports, and conference proceedings.", "A search of websites with a grey background.", "A search of studies with inconclusive results."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grey literature refers to studies and reports that have not been published in traditional academic journals, such as government reports, conference proceedings, and theses."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Imagine a client, Sarah, reports feeling significantly better after taking a Reishi mushroom supplement, despite the clinical trial she participated in being a placebo group. This is MOST likely an example of:",
            "options": ["Publication bias.", "The nocebo effect.", "The Hawthorne effect.", "The placebo effect."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The placebo effect is a phenomenon where a person experiences a benefit after receiving a placebo treatment, which is a substance with no known therapeutic effect. Sarah's experience aligns with this effect."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Which of the following grading systems is commonly used to assess the quality of evidence in healthcare research?",
            "options": ["The Dewey Decimal System.", "The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).", "The Kelvin scale.", "The Richter scale."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The GRADE system is a widely used framework for assessing the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations in healthcare, considering factors like study design, risk of bias, and consistency of results."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "When communicating research findings about medicinal mushrooms to the public, what is the MOST important ethical consideration?",
            "options": ["Exaggerating the benefits to increase sales.", "Presenting the findings in a way that is easy to understand but may oversimplify the results.", "Providing only the positive results and omitting any negative findings.", "Avoiding sensationalism and presenting the findings accurately and objectively, acknowledging limitations."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Ethical communication requires presenting research findings honestly and accurately, acknowledging the limitations of the studies and avoiding any misleading or sensationalized claims."
