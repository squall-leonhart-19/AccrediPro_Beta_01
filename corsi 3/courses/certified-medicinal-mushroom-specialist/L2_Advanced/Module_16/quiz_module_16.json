            "question": "In the case study involving autoimmune conditions and Cordyceps, what was the primary mechanism of action hypothesized to contribute to the observed improvements?",
            "options": ["Direct cytotoxic effect on immune cells", "Modulation of the gut microbiome", "Regulation of the Th1/Th2 balance", "Stimulation of interferon production"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cordyceps is believed to help regulate the Th1/Th2 balance, which is often dysregulated in autoimmune conditions. The case study suggested this modulation contributed to symptom improvement."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "Lion's Mane's cognitive benefits are primarily attributed to its ability to stimulate the production of which substance?",
            "options": ["Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)", "Dopamine", "Serotonin", "Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Lion's Mane contains compounds that stimulate the production of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a key protein involved in neuronal growth and survival."

            "question": "A client undergoing cancer treatment is considering Reishi supplementation. What is the MOST important consideration regarding potential interactions?",
            "options": ["Reishi may interfere with chemotherapy drugs", "Reishi always increases the risk of bleeding", "Reishi has no known interactions with cancer treatments", "Reishi will completely eliminate the need for other treatments"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reishi can potentially interact with chemotherapy drugs, affecting their efficacy or increasing side effects. It's crucial to consult with an oncologist before combining Reishi with conventional cancer treatments."

            "options": ["Beta-glucans", "Triterpenes", "Ergosterol", "Polyphenols"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Turkey Tail contains a high amount of beta-glucans, which are polysaccharides that act as prebiotics, nourishing beneficial gut bacteria and supporting a healthy gut microbiome."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "When combining multiple medicinal mushrooms, what is a key strategy to minimize potential adverse effects?",
            "options": ["Starting with high doses of each mushroom", "Introducing each mushroom one at a time", "Combining all mushrooms simultaneously for synergistic effects", "Ignoring potential interactions as mushrooms are generally safe"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introducing each mushroom one at a time allows you to monitor for individual reactions and identify any potential adverse effects associated with a specific mushroom before adding others."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A client experiences flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches) shortly after starting a high dose of medicinal mushrooms. This is MOST likely indicative of:",
            "options": ["An allergic reaction", "A Herxheimer reaction", "A coincidental viral infection", "Dehydration"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flu-like symptoms shortly after starting medicinal mushrooms can indicate a Herxheimer reaction, where the body is rapidly detoxifying and eliminating toxins."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Why is cycling medicinal mushrooms sometimes recommended for long-term use?",
            "options": ["To prevent the body from adapting to the mushroom's effects", "To increase the potency of the mushrooms", "To save money on supplements", "To avoid potential drug interactions"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cycling involves alternating periods of mushroom use with periods of abstinence to prevent the body from adapting and potentially reducing the mushroom's effectiveness over time."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is considered an ethical consideration when recommending medicinal mushrooms to a client?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the client is fully informed about potential benefits and risks", "Guaranteeing a specific outcome from mushroom use", "Recommending the most expensive mushroom product available", "Diagnosing medical conditions based solely on mushroom knowledge"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires providing clients with comprehensive information about the potential benefits, risks, and limitations of medicinal mushroom use to allow for informed consent."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client with a known allergy to mold should exercise caution when using which medicinal mushroom due to potential cross-reactivity?",
            "options": ["Reishi", "Shiitake", "Cordyceps", "All medicinal mushrooms"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Individuals with mold allergies may experience cross-reactivity with any medicinal mushroom as mushrooms are fungi. Caution and careful monitoring are advised."
