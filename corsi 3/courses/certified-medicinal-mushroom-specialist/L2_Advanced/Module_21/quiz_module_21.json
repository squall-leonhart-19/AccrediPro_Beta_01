            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing mild gastrointestinal upset after starting a medicinal mushroom protocol. According to the dosage strategies discussed, what is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the protocol.", "Reduce the dosage and gradually titrate upwards.", "Administer an anti-diarrheal medication.", "Increase the dosage to build tolerance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradually titrating the dosage allows the body to adjust and minimizes potential side effects. Starting with a lower dose and increasing slowly is a key strategy for managing tolerability."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In Sarah's case study, Reishi spore oil capsules, known for their high concentration of triterpenes, demonstrated the most significant improvements in relaxation and sleep quality compared to other formulations."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique involves analyzing specific biomarkers in the client's blood, urine, or saliva to identify potential imbalances that medicinal mushrooms can address?",
            "options": ["Pulse Diagnosis", "Functional Lab Testing", "Iridology", "Muscle Testing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional lab testing provides objective data on various biomarkers, allowing for a more targeted and personalized approach to medicinal mushroom therapy based on individual needs."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A client taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant should generally avoid which medicinal mushroom due to its potential to stimulate the immune system?",
            "options": ["Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor)", "Shiitake (Lentinula edodes)", "Maitake (Grifola frondosa)", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Medicinal mushrooms that stimulate the immune system, such as Turkey Tail, Shiitake, and Maitake, should be used with caution or avoided in individuals taking immunosuppressant drugs to prevent potential interference with the medication's effects."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of incorporating a 'washout period' in a medicinal mushroom treatment plan?",
            "options": ["To accelerate the effects of the mushrooms.", "To prevent the body from adapting to the mushrooms.", "To reduce the risk of allergic reactions.", "To assess the baseline state of the client without mushroom influence."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A washout period allows for a clearer assessment of the client's condition without the influence of the mushrooms, providing a more accurate baseline for evaluating treatment effectiveness."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "According to research, which delivery system is MOST likely to maximize the bioavailability of polysaccharides from medicinal mushrooms?",
            "options": ["Raw mushroom powder", "Hot water extract", "Alcohol extract", "Cold water infusion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hot water extraction is effective in breaking down the chitinous cell walls of mushrooms, thereby increasing the bioavailability of polysaccharides, which are water-soluble compounds."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "A client with a known allergy to mold reports a reaction after consuming a medicinal mushroom supplement. What is the MOST likely explanation?",
            "options": ["The client is experiencing a placebo effect.", "The mushroom was contaminated with mold spores.", "The client's allergy is unrelated to the mushrooms.", "The client is allergic to all fungi."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Contamination with mold spores during cultivation or processing is a possible cause of allergic reactions in individuals with mold sensitivities. Thorough testing and sourcing from reputable suppliers are crucial."
