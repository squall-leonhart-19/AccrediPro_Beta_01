            "question": "A client reports experiencing mild Herxheimer reactions after starting a Reishi mushroom supplement. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial strategy?",
            "options": [
                "Immediately discontinue the Reishi and switch to a different mushroom.",
                "Reduce the dosage by 50% and increase water intake.",
                "Administer an antihistamine to alleviate the symptoms.",
                "Increase the dosage to accelerate the detoxification process."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing the dosage and increasing water intake are the most appropriate first steps to manage mild Herxheimer reactions. Discontinuing the supplement entirely may not be necessary, and antihistamines don't address the root cause. Increasing the dosage could worsen the reaction."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual extraction, involving hot water extraction followed by ethanol extraction, is considered the gold standard for medicinal mushrooms as it captures both water-soluble (e.g., polysaccharides) and non-water-soluble (e.g., triterpenes) compounds."

                "Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis)"
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor) is extensively researched for its immunomodulatory effects, primarily due to its polysaccharide content (PSK and PSP), and is often used to support individuals undergoing cancer treatment. Clinical trials have shown its potential to improve immune function and reduce chemotherapy side effects."

                "Shiitake and Oyster mushroom for cognitive enhancement."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While both Shiitake and Oyster mushrooms offer nutritional benefits, there is less evidence to support a synergistic effect for cognitive enhancement compared to other combinations like Reishi and Lion's Mane or Cordyceps and Lion's Mane."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "When cycling medicinal mushrooms, what is the primary rationale behind taking breaks from supplementation?",
            "options": [
                "To prevent the development of tolerance to the mushroom's effects.",
                "To minimize the risk of allergic reactions.",
                "To reduce the cost of supplementation.",
                "To enhance the absorption of nutrients."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cycling is often employed to prevent the body from adapting to the effects of the mushrooms, thus maintaining their efficacy over the long term. This strategy helps avoid tolerance and allows the body to remain responsive to the mushroom's compounds."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Herxheimer reactions often manifest as flu-like symptoms due to the release of toxins during the detoxification process. This can include fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and sometimes skin breakouts."

            "question": "A client is taking Warfarin (a blood thinner). Which medicinal mushroom should be used with extreme caution, if at all, due to its potential antiplatelet effects?",
            "options": [
                "Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)",
                "Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus)",

            "question": "According to research, which specific component of Lion's Mane mushroom is believed to be primarily responsible for its neurotrophic (nerve growth-promoting) effects?",
            "options": [
                "Beta-glucans",
                "Triterpenes",
