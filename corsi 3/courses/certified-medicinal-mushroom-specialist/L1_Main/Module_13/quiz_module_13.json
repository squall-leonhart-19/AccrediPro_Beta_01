            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding advanced dosage strategies for medicinal mushrooms?",
            "options": ["Fixed dosages are always optimal for consistent results.", "Individual responses to medicinal mushrooms can vary greatly, necessitating personalized dosage adjustments.", "Higher dosages invariably lead to better therapeutic outcomes.", "Dosage adjustments should only be made based on standardized weight charts."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individual responses to medicinal mushrooms are highly variable due to factors like genetics, gut microbiome composition, and overall health. Personalized dosage adjustments are crucial for optimal efficacy and safety."
