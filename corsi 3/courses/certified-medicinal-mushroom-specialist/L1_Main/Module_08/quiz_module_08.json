            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "Which advanced extraction technique is MOST effective for isolating heat-sensitive terpenoids from Reishi mushrooms?",
            "options": ["Hot water extraction", "Ethanol extraction at 80°C", "Supercritical CO2 extraction", "Soxhlet extraction with methanol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supercritical CO2 extraction is ideal for heat-sensitive compounds because it operates at lower temperatures, preserving the integrity of terpenoids."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "A polysaccharide analysis report indicates a beta-glucan content of 45% with a branching ratio of 1:3. What does this branching ratio suggest about the potential immunomodulatory activity?",
            "options": ["Low immunomodulatory activity", "Moderate immunomodulatory activity", "High immunomodulatory activity", "No impact on immunomodulatory activity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Higher branching ratios (closer to 1:3 or 1:2) generally correlate with enhanced receptor binding and increased immunomodulatory activity. A 2021 study in 'Frontiers in Immunology' supports this."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Which analytical method is BEST suited for quantifying the specific types and concentrations of individual terpenoids present in a mushroom extract?",
            "options": ["UV-Vis spectrophotometry", "Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)", "Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)", "High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with refractive index detection"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GC-MS provides detailed identification and quantification of volatile compounds like terpenoids due to its ability to separate and detect compounds based on their mass-to-charge ratio."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "A batch of Chaga extract is found to contain high levels of heavy metals. Which quality control test would have MOST likely detected this contamination?",
            "options": ["Microbial load testing", "Beta-glucan assay", "Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)", "Terpenoid profiling"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is specifically designed to detect and quantify heavy metals in a sample, making it the most appropriate choice for this scenario."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "Which environmental factor is MOST critical to control when cultivating Lion's Mane mushrooms to maximize hericenone and erinacine production?",
            "options": ["Substrate pH", "Light exposure", "Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels", "Humidity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that specific light spectra, particularly blue light, can significantly enhance the production of hericenones and erinacines in Lion's Mane. See Mori et al. (2008)."

            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client taking warfarin is considering using Reishi mushroom supplements. What potential mushroom-drug interaction should be of GREATEST concern?",
            "options": ["Increased absorption of warfarin", "Decreased efficacy of warfarin", "Increased risk of bleeding", "Reduced liver metabolism of warfarin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reishi possesses antiplatelet activity, which can potentiate the effects of warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding. This interaction is well-documented in pharmacology literature."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Which of the following practices BEST exemplifies ethical sourcing of Cordyceps sinensis?",
            "options": ["Harvesting from protected alpine meadows without permits", "Cultivating Cordyceps mycelium on grain substrates in a controlled environment", "Importing wild-harvested Cordyceps from Tibet without regard for local regulations", "Purchasing Cordyceps from suppliers who cannot verify the origin of their product"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultivating Cordyceps mycelium on grain substrates in a controlled environment reduces pressure on wild populations and ensures a sustainable supply."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "A client with anxiety and insomnia is unresponsive to low doses of Reishi. Based on advanced case study principles, what initial adjustment to the protocol would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Switch to a different mushroom species", "Increase the Reishi dosage gradually while monitoring for side effects", "Add a stimulant to counteract the sedative effects", "Discontinue mushroom supplementation altogether"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Individual responses vary. Gradually increasing the dosage, while carefully monitoring for adverse effects, is a reasonable approach to assess individual sensitivity and tolerance. Start low, go slow."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "Which extraction method would be MOST suitable for isolating water-soluble polysaccharides, such as beta-glucans, from a mushroom fruiting body?",
            "options": ["Ethanol extraction", "Supercritical CO2 extraction", "Hot water extraction", "Methanol extraction"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hot water extraction is the most effective method for isolating water-soluble polysaccharides like beta-glucans due to their hydrophilic nature. This is a well-established technique in mycochemistry."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "A patient presents with elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) after starting a high-dose mushroom supplement regimen. Which of the following actions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all mushroom supplements and refer for liver function testing", "Continue the supplements at the same dose, as elevated enzymes are a normal adaptation", "Reduce the dose by 50% and monitor enzyme levels weekly", "Add a liver-protective herb to the regimen to counteract the effect"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage. Immediate discontinuation and referral for testing are crucial to rule out supplement-induced hepatotoxicity, as indicated in recent case reports (e.g., Patel et al., 2022)."
