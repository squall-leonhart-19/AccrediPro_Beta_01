            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In a complex case study involving a client with both anxiety and mild cognitive impairment, which mushroom combination would MOST likely address both conditions effectively, based on synergistic properties discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["Reishi and Shiitake", "Lion's Mane and Reishi", "Chaga and Cordyceps", "Turkey Tail and Maitake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lion's Mane is known for its neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties, while Reishi is known for its calming and anxiolytic effects. This combination creates a synergistic effect, addressing both conditions simultaneously."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing mild gastrointestinal discomfort after starting a high dose of Chaga extract. According to the module, what is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Discontinue Chaga immediately and switch to Turkey Tail.", "Reduce the dosage of Chaga and take it with food.", "Add a probiotic supplement to counteract the gastrointestinal effects.", "Increase water intake to help the body process the Chaga."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing the dosage and taking Chaga with food can often mitigate gastrointestinal discomfort. This allows the client to continue benefiting from Chaga's properties while minimizing side effects. A gradual increase in dosage can be attempted later."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "Which extraction method is generally considered BEST for maximizing the bioavailability of triterpenoids, a key compound found in Reishi mushrooms?",
            "options": ["Cold water extraction", "Ethanol extraction", "Hot water extraction", "CO2 extraction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethanol extraction is more effective at extracting non-polar compounds like triterpenoids, which are less soluble in water. This method ensures a higher concentration of these beneficial compounds in the final product."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "According to the legal and regulatory landscape discussed, what is the PRIMARY risk associated with marketing mushroom products with unsubstantiated health claims?",
            "options": ["Increased consumer demand.", "Potential for FDA warning letters or legal action.", "Higher production costs.", "Difficulty in sourcing raw materials."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Marketing products with unsubstantiated health claims can lead to regulatory scrutiny from agencies like the FDA, potentially resulting in warning letters, fines, or legal action. It is essential to adhere to established regulations and avoid making claims that cannot be scientifically supported."

            "question": "A 55-year-old client with a history of autoimmune disease is considering using medicinal mushrooms to support their immune system. Which mushroom would require the MOST caution and careful monitoring due to its potential to overstimulate the immune system?",
            "options": ["Reishi", "Shiitake", "Turkey Tail", "Cordyceps"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cordyceps is a potent immune modulator and, while beneficial for many, can potentially overstimulate the immune system in individuals with autoimmune diseases. Careful monitoring and a gradual introduction are crucial in these cases."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "Based on the module's discussion of the gut-mushroom connection, which of the following mushroom polysaccharides is MOST likely to act as a prebiotic, promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria?",
            "options": ["Triterpenes", "Beta-glucans", "Ergosterol", "Melanin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beta-glucans are complex polysaccharides that are not easily digested in the upper digestive tract. They reach the colon, where they serve as a food source for beneficial gut bacteria, promoting their growth and activity."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "When formulating a mushroom supplement for enhanced cognitive function, which ingredient would synergize BEST with Lion's Mane to further improve memory and focus?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Ginkgo Biloba", "Melatonin", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ginkgo Biloba is known for its cognitive-enhancing properties, particularly its ability to improve blood flow to the brain and enhance memory. Combining it with Lion's Mane, which promotes nerve growth factor (NGF), can create a synergistic effect for improved cognitive function."

            "question": "In a case study presented in the module, a client taking warfarin (a blood thinner) experienced increased bleeding after starting a high dose of which medicinal mushroom?",
            "options": ["Reishi", "Chaga", "Shiitake", "Maitake"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reishi mushrooms have demonstrated antiplatelet activity and may potentiate the effects of anticoagulant medications like warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. This interaction highlights the importance of considering potential drug interactions when recommending medicinal mushrooms."
