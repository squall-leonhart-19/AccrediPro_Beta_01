            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical initial step when faced with an ethical dilemma in ADHD support?",
            "options": ["Consulting with a supervisor or colleague", "Documenting the situation thoroughly", "Identifying the relevant ethical principles involved", "Immediately informing the client of the dilemma"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying the relevant ethical principles provides a framework for analyzing the situation and determining the most ethical course of action. This is a foundational step before other actions are taken."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "According to guidelines discussed, at what point should confidentiality limitations be discussed with a new client receiving ADHD support?",
            "options": ["Only if the client specifically asks about confidentiality", "After several sessions, once a trusting relationship is established", "During the initial intake and informed consent process", "Only if a breach of confidentiality is anticipated"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality and its limitations must be clearly explained during the informed consent process to ensure the client understands the boundaries of privacy from the outset."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A support specialist begins dating a former client six months after formally terminating their professional relationship. Ethically, is this permissible?",
            "options": ["Yes, because the professional relationship has ended.", "Yes, as long as the former client initiates the dating relationship.", "No, because it constitutes a boundary violation and potential exploitation.", "No, but only if the former client is deemed vulnerable."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dating a former client, even after termination, is generally considered unethical due to the potential for exploitation and the power imbalance inherent in the previous professional relationship. Guidelines often recommend a significant waiting period or outright prohibition."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A client asks their ADHD support specialist for advice on investing in a specific stock because the specialist mentioned having some success with it. What is the most ethical course of action for the specialist?",
            "options": ["Provide general information about investing, but avoid specific recommendations.", "Decline to offer any advice, explaining that it falls outside their scope of practice.", "Share their personal experience with the stock, but caution the client about risks.", "Recommend a qualified financial advisor and end the conversation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing financial advice falls outside the scope of practice for an ADHD support specialist. It's ethical to decline offering advice and to suggest the client seek guidance from a qualified professional."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Which of the following BEST exemplifies client autonomy in the context of ADHD support?",
            "options": ["The specialist chooses the most effective strategies for the client.", "The client's family decides on the treatment plan.", "The client has the right to make informed decisions about their support.", "The specialist always follows the client's preferences, regardless of potential harm."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client autonomy emphasizes the client's right to make informed decisions about their support, based on their values and preferences, even if the specialist has a different opinion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "An ADHD support specialist receives a referral fee from a local tutoring service for recommending them to a client. What ethical principle is MOST directly violated?",
            "options": ["Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Justice", "Fidelity"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Accepting referral fees creates a conflict of interest, violating the principle of fidelity, which requires professionals to be loyal and trustworthy to their clients, putting the client's best interests first, not their own financial gain. It undermines the specialist's impartiality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "In telehealth, what is a PRIMARY ethical consideration regarding technology?",
            "options": ["Using the latest technology, regardless of cost.", "Ensuring the client has access to a reliable and secure platform.", "Relying solely on email for communication to maintain a written record.", "Assuming all clients are technologically proficient."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ensuring access to a reliable and secure platform is paramount in telehealth to protect client confidentiality and ensure effective communication. Not all clients may have equal access or technological skills."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "A client reports suicidal ideation during a session. What is the MOST appropriate initial ethical response?",
            "options": ["Immediately terminate the session and refer the client to a psychiatrist.", "Maintain confidentiality and encourage the client to explore their feelings.", "Assess the client's risk of harm to self or others and take appropriate action, even if it means breaching confidentiality.", "Document the client's statement and continue with the planned agenda."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client reports suicidal ideation, the ethical obligation to protect the client from harm overrides confidentiality. Assessing risk and taking appropriate action (e.g., contacting emergency services, informing a supervisor) is crucial."

        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "An ADHD support specialist is asked to provide services to a client with whom they share a close friendship. What is the MOST appropriate ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Accept the client, but maintain strict professional boundaries.", "Accept the client only if no other specialist is available.", "Decline to provide services due to the potential for a dual relationship and impaired objectivity.", "Accept the client, but charge a reduced fee due to the friendship."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing services to a close friend creates a dual relationship, which can compromise objectivity, blur boundaries, and potentially harm the client. Declining the services is typically the most ethical course of action."

            "id": "q22_10",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If a support specialist lacks the expertise to help a client effectively, the most ethical course of action is to refer the client to a specialist with the appropriate expertise. This prioritizes the client's well-being and avoids potential harm."
