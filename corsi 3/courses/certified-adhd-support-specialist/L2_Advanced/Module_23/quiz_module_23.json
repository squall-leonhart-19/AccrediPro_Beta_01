            "question": "Which of the following is a core principle of Motivational Interviewing (MI) that emphasizes collaboration over confrontation when working with adults with ADHD?",
            "options": ["Directing", "Following", "Guiding", "Instructing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guiding is a core principle of MI, emphasizing collaboration and partnership with the client, rather than directing or confronting them. This approach is particularly effective for individuals with ADHD who may resist feeling controlled."

        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "A client with ADHD consistently catastrophizes minor setbacks, stating 'I'm going to fail everything because I failed this one task.' Which cognitive restructuring technique would be MOST effective in addressing this cognitive distortion?",
            "options": ["Thought stopping", "Socratic questioning", "Behavioral activation", "Exposure therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Socratic questioning helps the client examine the evidence for and against their catastrophic belief, leading them to a more balanced and realistic perspective. This approach is more effective than simply stopping the thought (thought stopping) without addressing the underlying belief."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to studies discussed, what percentage of adults with ADHD experience co-occurring anxiety disorders, which can be effectively addressed through mindfulness-based interventions?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "20-30%", "30-50%", "50-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that 50-70% of adults with ADHD experience co-occurring anxiety disorders. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to reduce anxiety symptoms and improve executive function in this population."

            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "In neurofeedback for ADHD, what does the theta/beta ratio typically represent, and what is the general goal of neurofeedback training in relation to this ratio?",
            "options": ["Ratio of slow-wave to fast-wave activity; decrease the ratio", "Ratio of fast-wave to slow-wave activity; increase the ratio", "Ratio of delta to alpha activity; maintain the ratio", "Ratio of gamma to mu activity; decrease the ratio"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The theta/beta ratio represents the ratio of slow-wave (theta) to fast-wave (beta) brain activity. The goal of neurofeedback training is typically to decrease this ratio, promoting increased focus and attention."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "'Eat the Frog' encourages tackling the most challenging or important task first, aligning with the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to maximize productivity. The other options are helpful but don't directly address prioritization in the same way."

            "explanation": "Behavioral rehearsal involves practicing specific social interactions in a safe environment, allowing individuals to develop and refine their social skills through feedback and repetition. This technique is particularly helpful for those with ADHD who struggle with social cues and interactions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Text-to-speech software directly addresses reading comprehension difficulties by converting written text into spoken words, allowing the client to process information auditorily.
