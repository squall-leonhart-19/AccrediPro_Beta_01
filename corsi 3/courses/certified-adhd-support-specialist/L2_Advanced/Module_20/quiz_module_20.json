            "question": "In the case study of Sarah, a 35-year-old client, which assessment tool was MOST helpful in identifying her executive function deficits impacting her work performance?",
            "options": ["Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)", "Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)", "Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales (BADDS)", "Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The BRIEF-A is specifically designed to assess executive function in adults, making it the most relevant tool for identifying Sarah's work-related challenges."

            "options": ["The informant should be a healthcare professional.", "The informant should have known the individual since childhood.", "The informant should have regular and recent contact with the individual.", "The informant should be unaware of the individual's self-reported symptoms."],

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of using objective measures, such as continuous performance tests (CPTs), in ADHD assessment?",
            "options": ["To gather subjective information about the individual's symptoms.", "To directly observe the individual's behavior in a natural setting.", "To provide a standardized and quantifiable assessment of attention and impulsivity.", "To replace the need for clinical interviews and self-report scales."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "CPTs offer a standardized way to measure attention and impulsivity, complementing subjective reports with objective data."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Understand' component of the F.O.C.U.S. Framework™ uses the assessment data to develop a comprehensive understanding of the client's ADHD and its impact."

            "options": ["Disregard the ASRS results and rely solely on other assessment data.", "Administer the ASRS again, emphasizing the importance of honest and accurate responses.", "Average the inconsistent responses to obtain a more reliable score.", "Explore the reasons for the inconsistencies during the clinical interview."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Inconsistent responses may indicate a lack of understanding, defensiveness, or other factors that should be explored further during the clinical interview to ensure accurate interpretation of the results."
