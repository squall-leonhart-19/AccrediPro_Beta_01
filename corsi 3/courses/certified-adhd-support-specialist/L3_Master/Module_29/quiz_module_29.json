            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical first step when tailoring the FOCUS Framework™ for a client with ADHD and co-occurring anxiety?",
            "options": ["Immediately implementing executive function training.", "Conducting a thorough assessment of both ADHD and anxiety symptoms.", "Prescribing medication for anxiety.", "Focusing solely on ADHD symptoms to avoid overwhelming the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive assessment is crucial to understand the interplay between ADHD and anxiety, allowing for a targeted and effective intervention strategy. Addressing both conditions concurrently, rather than in isolation, is generally more effective."

            "id": "q29_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 10), is struggling with time management and organization. Her parents report significant conflict at home related to homework completion. Which evidence-based practice would be MOST appropriate to integrate into her FOCUS Framework™ plan?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focusing on thought distortions.", "Mindfulness training for emotional regulation.", "Executive function training targeting planning and prioritization skills.", "Play therapy to address underlying emotional issues."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Executive function training directly addresses the core deficits in planning, organization, and time management often seen in ADHD, making it the most relevant intervention for Sarah's specific challenges. CBT and mindfulness can be complementary but are not the primary intervention for time management."

            "question": "You are working with a 16-year-old client, Michael, who discloses that he is using his ADHD medication more frequently than prescribed to help him focus while gaming. What is the MOST appropriate ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately inform his parents without Michael's consent.", "Maintain confidentiality and continue working with Michael without addressing the issue.", "Explore Michael's motivations for misuse and collaborate with him to develop a safer medication management plan, involving his parents with his consent if possible.", "Terminate services immediately due to the ethical violation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing Michael's safety and well-being while respecting his autonomy is key. Exploring his motivations and collaborating on a safer plan is the most ethical approach. Involving parents is important but should be done with Michael's consent if possible, balancing confidentiality with duty to protect."
