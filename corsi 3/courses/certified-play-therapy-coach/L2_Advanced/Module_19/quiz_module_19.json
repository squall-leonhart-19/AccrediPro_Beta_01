            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a systematic review in play therapy research?",
            "options": ["To provide a personal opinion on a specific play therapy technique.", "To summarize and critically appraise all relevant research on a specific question using explicit methods.", "To conduct a single study with a large sample size.", "To ignore conflicting research findings and promote a particular viewpoint."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews use rigorous methods to identify, evaluate, and synthesize all relevant studies on a specific research question."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of child-centered play therapy (CCPT) for anxiety, what is the purpose of the control group?",
            "options": ["To receive the same treatment as the experimental group.", "To receive no treatment or a standard treatment, allowing for comparison with the CCPT group.", "To receive a different type of play therapy.", "To provide feedback on the CCPT intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The control group serves as a baseline for comparison, helping to determine if the CCPT intervention is more effective than no treatment or a standard treatment."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of Single-Case Research Designs (SCRDs) in play therapy?",
            "options": ["They can establish cause-and-effect relationships with large groups of participants.", "They are useful for studying rare or unique cases in depth.", "They are less time-consuming than RCTs.", "They eliminate the need for statistical analysis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCRDs are particularly useful for examining the effects of interventions on individual clients with specific needs or presenting problems."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A play therapist reads a study concluding that sand tray therapy is highly effective for all children with ADHD. What critical evaluation question should the therapist consider FIRST?",
            "options": ["Is the sample size large enough to generalize the findings?", "What is the theoretical framework underlying sand tray therapy?", "Are there any potential biases in the study design or interpretation of results?", "How much does sand tray therapy cost compared to other interventions?"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to assess potential biases and limitations in research to avoid overgeneralizing findings and ensure responsible application of interventions."

            "question": "A client, 8-year-old 'Liam', presents with symptoms of anxiety and behavioral challenges at school. The play therapist reviews research on CCPT and finds strong evidence supporting its effectiveness for anxiety in children. However, Liam's parents express concerns about the time commitment and cost of CCPT. How should the play therapist proceed, according to EBP principles?",
            "options": ["Insist on implementing CCPT regardless of parental concerns.", "Dismiss parental concerns and proceed with CCPT based on the research evidence.", "Collaborate with the parents to explore alternative interventions or modifications to CCPT that address their concerns, while still considering the research evidence.", "Abandon the idea of play therapy altogether and refer Liam to a different type of therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "EBP emphasizes collaboration with clients and families to integrate research evidence with their values, preferences, and resources, ensuring a client-centered approach."
