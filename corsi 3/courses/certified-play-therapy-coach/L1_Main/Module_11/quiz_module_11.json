            "question": "In advanced limit setting, which of the following is the MOST effective way to respond when a child repeatedly breaks a previously established limit?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior to avoid power struggles.", "Implementing a pre-determined consequence calmly and consistently.", "Yelling to assert authority and prevent further limit-breaking.", "Negotiating the limit to make it more palatable for the child."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistency and calm implementation of pre-determined consequences are crucial for effective limit setting. A 2018 study in the 'Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry' showed that consistent limit setting significantly reduces challenging behaviors (Smith et al., 2018)."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "During a play therapy session, a child consistently avoids eye contact and exhibits minimal facial expressions. Which attunement skill is MOST important to focus on initially?",
            "options": ["Matching the child's affect and energy level.", "Offering verbal reassurance and encouragement.", "Providing a wide range of play materials to stimulate engagement.", "Directly asking the child about their feelings."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Matching the child's affect and energy level helps create a sense of safety and connection, particularly when nonverbal communication is limited. This approach fosters trust and encourages the child to gradually open up. Porges (2011) highlights the importance of mirroring in establishing a secure connection."

            "options": ["Instructing the child to create a 'happier' scene with brighter colors.", "Providing a variety of art materials and allowing the child to freely express themselves without direction.", "Interpreting the sandtray scene for the child to explain its meaning.", "Limiting the child to specific art materials that promote calmness."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing free expression through art allows the child to explore and process their emotions without feeling judged or directed. Landreth (2012) emphasizes the importance of a non-directive approach in play therapy."

            "question": "In trauma-informed play therapy, what is the PRIMARY goal when working with a child who experiences frequent flashbacks during sessions?",
            "options": ["To encourage the child to confront and process the traumatic memories directly.", "To create a safe and predictable environment that minimizes triggers.", "To use hypnosis to suppress the traumatic memories.", "To avoid any discussion or play related to the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating a safe and predictable environment is paramount in trauma-informed play therapy. This helps the child regulate their emotions and reduces the likelihood of overwhelming flashbacks. van der Kolk (2014) emphasizes the importance of safety in trauma recovery."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Modeling effective communication and providing practice opportunities allows the family to learn and implement healthier interaction patterns. Guerney (1997) highlights the effectiveness of Filial Therapy in improving family communication."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adolescents often benefit from a combination of play-based and verbal interventions. Incorporating cognitive strategies and allowing for verbal processing helps them make sense of their experiences. Knell (1998) discusses adapting play therapy for adolescents."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Facilitating a story about the tower and its collapse allows Maria to project her feelings and explore her anxieties in a safe and symbolic way.

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While parental involvement is often beneficial, prioritizing the adolescent's safety and providing a confidential space for exploration is crucial, especially when disclosure could lead to negative consequences.
