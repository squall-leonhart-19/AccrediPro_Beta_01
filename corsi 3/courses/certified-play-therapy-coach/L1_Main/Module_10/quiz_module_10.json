            "question": "In advanced limit setting, which approach is MOST effective when a child repeatedly breaks a previously established rule during a play therapy session, despite understanding the consequences?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior to avoid power struggles.", "Immediately ending the play therapy session.", "Empathizing with the child's feelings while consistently enforcing the limit and exploring the underlying need.", "Introducing a new, stricter rule to regain control."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consistently enforcing limits while empathizing with the child's feelings and exploring the underlying need helps the child feel understood while learning to respect boundaries. This aligns with attachment-based play therapy principles."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A therapist notices a child consistently avoids eye contact and uses minimal facial expressions during play. Based on the lesson on deepening attunement, what is the MOST appropriate initial response?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Observing nonverbal cues in various contexts allows the therapist to gather more information and understand the potential reasons for the child's behavior before making assumptions or interpretations. This demonstrates mindful attunement."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "During a play therapy session, a child repeatedly role-plays a scenario where they are being bullied. To facilitate empowerment and address shame, what is the MOST effective intervention?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating multiple data points requires identifying patterns and inconsistencies to form a holistic understanding of the child. This approach minimizes bias and provides a richer, more accurate assessment."

            "question": "A caregiver consistently dismisses a child's emotional expression during play therapy sessions, stating, 'They're just doing it for attention.' How should the therapist BEST navigate this resistance?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating the caregiver's perspective while providing education allows the therapist to build rapport and address the caregiver's resistance without creating defensiveness. This approach promotes collaboration and supports the child's therapeutic progress."

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While autonomy is important, beneficence (acting in the child's best interest) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm) take precedence when there is a suspicion of abuse. Reporting the suspected abuse is necessary to protect the child from further harm, even if it violates their request for confidentiality."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Offering alternative outlets for the child's energy allows them to express their emotions in a safe and acceptable way, while still reinforcing the established limit. This approach addresses the underlying need driving the behavior."
