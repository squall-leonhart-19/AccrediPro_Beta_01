            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "In the initial assessment of a child presenting with crisis symptoms, which of the following is the MOST crucial immediate step?",
            "options": ["Administering a projective drawing test", "Establishing a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship", "Gathering detailed family history information", "Implementing specific play therapy interventions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and trust is paramount in crisis situations. Play therapy interventions and detailed history gathering are important but secondary to ensuring the child feels secure and understood initially."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A 7-year-old client, Lily, exposed to chronic domestic violence, consistently reenacts scenes of conflict in the playroom. According to trauma-informed play therapy principles, what is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Encouraging Lily to verbally narrate the story behind the play", "Setting firm limits on aggressive play and redirection to calmer activities", "Providing a safe and predictable environment for Lily to explore her experiences at her own pace", "Interpreting the meaning of Lily's play to help her understand her feelings"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed play therapy emphasizes creating a safe and predictable environment where the child can process their experiences without pressure. Forcing narration or interpretation too early can be retraumatizing."

        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Which of the following play therapy techniques is generally CONTRAINDICATED for children actively experiencing psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia?",
            "options": ["Sandplay therapy with directive themes", "Nondirective play therapy with a focus on self-expression", "Using puppets to explore social interactions", "Engaging in sensory-based play activities"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Directive sandplay with specific themes can exacerbate psychotic symptoms by imposing external structure and potentially triggering delusions or hallucinations. Nondirective and sensory-based approaches are often safer."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A play therapist is working with a 9-year-old child diagnosed with bipolar disorder. During a session, the child exhibits rapid speech, inflated self-esteem, and decreased need for sleep, while using play to create grandiose scenarios. Which phase of bipolar disorder is the child MOST likely experiencing?",
            "options": ["Depressive episode", "Hypomanic episode", "Mixed episode", "Euthymic mood"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The symptoms described (rapid speech, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep) are characteristic of a hypomanic episode in bipolar disorder. The grandiose scenarios in play further support this diagnosis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 50-60% of abused children, without intervention, develop significant mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD later in life (Cicchetti & Toth, 2009)."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A 10-year-old client, whose parent recently died, persistently engages in play involving funerals and graveyards. What is the MOST developmentally appropriate response from the play therapist?",
            "options": ["Immediately redirecting the child to more positive play themes", "Interpreting the child's play as a sign of unresolved grief and trauma", "Providing a supportive and validating space for the child to explore their feelings and experiences related to loss", "Suggesting the child write a letter to their deceased parent to facilitate closure"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Allowing the child to explore their grief through play is a developmentally appropriate way to process loss. Validation and support are crucial. Premature redirection or interpretation can be harmful."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_7",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Directly asking about suicidal ideation is essential to assess the child's current risk level. This does not increase the risk of suicide; rather, it opens a dialogue and allows for appropriate intervention."

        {
            "id": "q28_8",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While a child's dissatisfaction with their living situation warrants further exploration, it does not automatically trigger a mandated report unless there are specific indicators of abuse or neglect. The other options all represent potential abuse or neglect scenarios."

            "id": "q28_9",

            "explanation": "Obtaining informed consent is crucial for ethical collaboration. This ensures parents/guardians are aware of and agree to the sharing of information and coordination of care between the play therapist and other professionals involved in the child's treatment."
