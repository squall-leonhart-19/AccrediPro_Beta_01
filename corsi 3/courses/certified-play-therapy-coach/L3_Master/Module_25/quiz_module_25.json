            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical element in establishing a strong supervisory relationship, as emphasized in the P.L.A.Y.E.D. framework?",
            "options": ["Providing immediate feedback on every session", "Establishing clear expectations and boundaries", "Focusing solely on the supervisee's clinical skills", "Avoiding discussion of personal issues affecting the supervisee"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The P.L.A.Y.E.D. framework emphasizes that establishing clear expectations and boundaries is foundational for a safe and productive supervisory relationship. This creates a structure within which the supervisee can grow."

        {
            "id": "q25_2",
            "question": "In the context of play therapy supervision, what does parallel process refer to?",
            "options": ["The supervisor mirroring the supervisee's play therapy techniques", "The supervisee replicating the supervisor's theoretical orientation", "The unconscious reenactment of the client-therapist relationship dynamics within the supervisory relationship", "The supervisor and supervisee working with the same client simultaneously"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Parallel process describes the unconscious mirroring of dynamics from the client-therapist relationship into the supervisory relationship. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for effective supervision."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A supervisee consistently struggles with setting limits in play therapy sessions, leading to chaotic and unproductive sessions. According to the lesson on techniques, which supervisory intervention would be MOST effective?",
            "options": ["Reviewing theoretical concepts of play therapy", "Role-playing limit-setting scenarios with the supervisee", "Assigning the supervisee readings on child development", "Ignoring the issue and hoping it resolves itself"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Role-playing allows the supervisee to practice limit-setting in a safe environment, receive immediate feedback, and develop confidence in their ability to manage challenging behaviors in play therapy."

            "id": "q25_4",
            "question": "According to research cited in the lesson on cultural competence, what percentage of therapists report feeling inadequately trained to work with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that approximately 50% of therapists feel inadequately trained to address the needs of culturally diverse clients. This highlights the importance of addressing cultural competence in supervision."

            "question": "In the lesson on evaluation, it was discussed that supervisee evaluations should be:",
            "options": ["Based solely on the supervisor's subjective impressions", "Conducted only at the end of the supervision period", "Objective, based on clear criteria, and provide specific feedback", "Avoided to prevent damaging the supervisory relationship"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective evaluations are objective, based on pre-established criteria, and provide specific feedback to promote supervisee growth and development. Subjective impressions alone are insufficient."

            "options": ["Referring the supervisee for their own play therapy", "Encouraging the supervisee to take on more challenging cases to build resilience", "Providing psychoeducation about vicarious trauma and strategies for self-care", "Dismissing the supervisee's concerns as a sign of weakness"],

            "explanation": "Providing psychoeducation about vicarious trauma and strategies for self-care is the most appropriate initial intervention. It validates the supervisee's experience and provides them with tools to manage their emotional well-being."

            "options": ["It is too time-consuming for the supervisor", "It can increase supervisee self-awareness", "It can lead to supervisee anxiety and performance pressure", "It provides the most accurate assessment of the supervisee's skills"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While live observation can be valuable, it can also induce anxiety and performance pressure in the supervisee, potentially leading to an inaccurate representation of their typical clinical skills."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the supervisee's anxieties and potential countertransference is crucial. This aligns with the 'Limiting Anxiety' aspect of the P.L.A.Y.E.D. framework, which prioritizes creating a safe and supportive environment for the supervisee to explore their feelings and develop confidence."
