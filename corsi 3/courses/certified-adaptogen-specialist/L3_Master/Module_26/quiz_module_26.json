            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the 'THRIVE' framework used in personalized adaptogen protocol design?",
            "options": ["A rigid, step-by-step process for adaptogen selection.", "A flexible guideline focusing on Target, History, Resources, Implementation, Validation, and Evolution.", "A method exclusively for athletic performance enhancement.", "A technique primarily used for acute stress management."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The THRIVE framework provides a flexible structure for personalized adaptogen protocols, encompassing key areas: Target, History, Resources, Implementation, Validation, and Evolution. It moves beyond rigid protocols to address individual client needs."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety after starting an adaptogen protocol that includes Ashwagandha. According to the lesson on troubleshooting, what is the MOST appropriate FIRST step to take?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all adaptogens.", "Increase the dosage of Ashwagandha to build tolerance.", "Re-evaluate the client's individual needs and consider alternative adaptogens or dosages.", "Prescribe an anxiolytic medication to counteract the anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When a client experiences adverse effects, the initial step is to re-evaluate their individual needs and the appropriateness of the chosen adaptogen. Adjusting dosage or switching to a different adaptogen is often more effective than immediate discontinuation or masking symptoms with medication."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Tailoring adaptogen choices requires a deep understanding of the client's unique health history, lifestyle, and stress response. This personalized approach is more effective than relying on generic recommendations."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the synergistic effects of Rhodiola Rosea and Ginseng in improving Sarah's energy levels and mood, addressing both fatigue and depression symptoms. This combination leverages the unique properties of each adaptogen."

            "options": ["To impress clients with scientific jargon.", "To provide objective data on the client's stress levels and track progress.", "To replace the need for client feedback.", "To justify the use of adaptogens."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validated questionnaires offer objective measures of stress and other relevant factors, allowing practitioners to track changes and assess the effectiveness of the adaptogen protocol. This data complements subjective client feedback."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "A client expresses skepticism about adaptogens, citing a lack of scientific evidence. What is the MOST effective communication strategy to address their concerns?",
            "options": ["Dismiss their concerns and insist on the benefits of adaptogens.", "Present them with a large volume of complex scientific literature.", "Acknowledge their concerns, provide clear and concise explanations of adaptogen mechanisms, and share relevant research findings (e.g., a meta-analysis showing a significant reduction in perceived stress with adaptogen use).", "Offer a money-back guarantee if the adaptogens don't work."],

            "explanation": "Addressing skepticism requires empathy and evidence-based communication. Providing accessible explanations and relevant research can build trust and encourage client compliance.
