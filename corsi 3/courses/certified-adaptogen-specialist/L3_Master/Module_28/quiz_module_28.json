            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "In an acute stress response, which adaptogen is MOST likely to be initially helpful in calming the nervous system, based on its rapid onset of action?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Eleuthero", "Holy Basil"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola Rosea is known for its relatively rapid onset of action in modulating the stress response, making it a suitable initial choice in acute situations. Case studies have shown improvement within hours."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing increased anxiety and insomnia after starting a high dose of Ashwagandha. What is the MOST appropriate FIRST step in managing this adverse reaction?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue Ashwagandha", "Reduce the dosage of Ashwagandha", "Add another adaptogen to counteract the side effects", "Refer the client to a psychiatrist"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing the dosage is typically the first step in managing adverse reactions to adaptogens. Discontinuation might be necessary if symptoms persist or worsen, but a dosage adjustment is a less drastic initial approach."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a PRIMARY concern when considering adaptogen use in a client also taking prescription medications for hypertension?",
            "options": ["Potential for additive hypotensive effects", "Increased risk of gastrointestinal distress", "Decreased effectiveness of the adaptogen", "Increased risk of hyperglycemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The primary concern is the potential for adaptogens like Rhodiola or Ashwagandha to lower blood pressure, which could have additive effects with antihypertensive medications, leading to hypotension. A 2022 study indicated additive hypotensive effects with certain adaptogens and ACE inhibitors."
        },

            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is interested in using adaptogens to manage fatigue. Which adaptogen should be approached with the MOST caution, and require careful monitoring of thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Eleuthero", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Holy Basil"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha has the potential to increase thyroid hormone levels, which could be problematic for individuals with autoimmune thyroid conditions. Careful monitoring is crucial to avoid exacerbating the condition. Studies suggest a small percentage of individuals experience thyroid changes with Ashwagandha."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In oncology support, which adaptogen is often considered for its potential to mitigate chemotherapy-induced nausea and fatigue, based on clinical trials?",
            "options": ["Schisandra", "Holy Basil", "Eleuthero", "Cordyceps"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eleuthero has been studied for its potential to reduce chemotherapy-induced fatigue and nausea. While other adaptogens may offer benefits, Eleuthero has more specific research in this context. A 2018 meta-analysis showed improved energy levels in cancer patients using Eleuthero."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "A client discloses they are seeing multiple practitioners and taking various supplements without informing their other healthcare providers. What is the MOST ETHICAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue working with the client but document the situation", "Refuse to work with the client due to lack of transparency", "Encourage the client to disclose this information to their other healthcare providers", "Contact the other healthcare providers directly to inform them"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Encouraging transparency and open communication between the client and their healthcare team is the most ethical approach. This promotes informed decision-making and reduces the risk of adverse interactions."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "During a crisis situation, what is the PRIMARY goal of applying the THRIVE framework?",
            "options": ["To immediately eliminate all symptoms", "To provide long-term solutions to underlying issues", "To stabilize the individual and prevent further escalation", "To diagnose the root cause of the crisis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of THRIVE in a crisis is stabilization and prevention of further escalation. While addressing underlying issues is important, the immediate focus is on safety and de-escalation."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "According to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), what is a manufacturer PROHIBITED from claiming on a dietary supplement label?",
            "options": ["The supplement supports a healthy immune system", "The supplement helps maintain normal cholesterol levels", "The supplement treats anxiety", "The supplement provides antioxidants"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DSHEA prohibits manufacturers from claiming that a dietary supplement can treat, cure, or prevent a disease. Claims about supporting healthy functions are generally permissible."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A client taking warfarin (a blood thinner) expresses interest in using adaptogens. Which adaptogen presents the HIGHEST risk of interaction and requires careful monitoring of INR levels?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea", "Holy Basil", "Ashwagandha", "Schisandra"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Schisandra is known to affect liver enzymes that metabolize warfarin, potentially altering its effectiveness and increasing the risk of bleeding. INR levels should be closely monitored if Schisandra is used concurrently. A 2021 study showed significant INR changes in patients taking Schisandra and warfarin."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A client with a history of severe panic attacks is considering adaptogens. What is the MOST important consideration before recommending a specific adaptogen?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the client has tried multiple pharmaceutical options first", "Starting with a very low dose and monitoring for paradoxical anxiety", "Recommending a high dose for rapid symptom relief", "Avoiding adaptogens altogether due to the risk of triggering a panic attack"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting with a very low dose and carefully monitoring for paradoxical anxiety is crucial in clients with a history of panic attacks. Some adaptogens can initially cause increased anxiety in sensitive individuals. A case study demonstrated that a low dose of Rhodiola, gradually increased, was well-tolerated in a client with anxiety."
