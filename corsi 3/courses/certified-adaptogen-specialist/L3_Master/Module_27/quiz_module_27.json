            "question": "A 42-year-old female client reports experiencing perimenopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, and mood swings. Which adaptogen is BEST suited to address these symptoms by modulating estrogen levels and supporting hormonal balance?",
            "options": ["Panax Ginseng", "Holy Basil (Tulsi)", "Maca", "Cordyceps"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Maca has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating perimenopausal symptoms. Studies suggest it can help balance estrogen levels and reduce the severity of hot flashes and mood swings. Unlike some other adaptogens, it does not exhibit estrogenic activity itself but supports the body's own hormonal regulation."

            "options": ["Cordyceps", "Hawthorn Berry", "Reishi Mushroom", "Ashwagandha"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hawthorn Berry is traditionally used and scientifically supported for cardiovascular health. It can help lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, and protect against oxidative damage to the heart and blood vessels. Studies have shown Hawthorn Berry can reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension."
