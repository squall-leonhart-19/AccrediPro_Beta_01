            "options": ["Discussing personal experiences with adaptogens.", "Clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and expectations.", "Sharing client testimonials to build trust.", "Establishing a casual, friendly atmosphere."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "A supervisee consistently struggles to differentiate between adaptogens that primarily target the HPA axis versus those with more pronounced antioxidant effects. What is the MOST effective supervisory intervention?",
            "options": ["Assigning the supervisee to read advanced research papers on adaptogen pharmacology.", "Providing targeted education and case study analysis focused on the specific mechanisms of action of different adaptogens.", "Recommending the supervisee shadow a more experienced practitioner.", "Dismissing the supervisee's concerns as a lack of interest in the subject."],

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaboratively reviewing client cases allows the supervisor to share their expertise, guide the supervisee through the complexities of adaptogen interactions, and help them develop individualized and evidence-based treatment plans."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing immediate emotional support, validating their experience, and referring them to a qualified mental health professional is the most ethical response. Supervisors are not qualified to provide mental health treatment and should prioritize the supervisee's well-being by connecting them with appropriate resources."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Documenting the supervisee's continued lack of competence and developing a formal remediation plan is essential for protecting client safety and ensuring ethical practice. This approach provides a structured framework for improvement and accountability."
