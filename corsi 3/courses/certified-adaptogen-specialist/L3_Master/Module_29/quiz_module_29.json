            "options": ["Immediately replacing existing supplements with adaptogens", "Thoroughly assessing potential interactions and contraindications", "Recommending the highest possible dose of a broad-spectrum adaptogen", "Ignoring the client's current regimen to start fresh"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client reports experiencing mild insomnia despite taking adaptogens recommended for stress reduction. Based on the principles of personalized protocol design, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all adaptogens.", "Increase the dosage to enhance sedative effects.", "Re-evaluate the timing of adaptogen administration and consider synergistic lifestyle changes.", "Add a stimulant adaptogen to counteract the insomnia."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adjusting the timing (e.g., taking adaptogens earlier in the day) and incorporating complementary lifestyle changes (e.g., improved sleep hygiene) are preferred before altering dosages or introducing new substances. This emphasizes a holistic approach, as covered in L2 and L3."

            "question": "According to research discussed in L8, which adaptogen shows the MOST promise for supporting cognitive function in aging populations?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola rosea", "Eleutherococcus senticosus", "Bacopa monnieri", "Panax ginseng"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While several adaptogens have cognitive benefits, Bacopa monnieri has been extensively studied for its neuroprotective and memory-enhancing effects, particularly in older adults. This is highlighted in the 'Synthesis and Future Directions' lesson."

            "options": ["Recommending high doses of immune-boosting adaptogens", "Avoiding adaptogens altogether due to potential immune stimulation", "Starting with low doses of immunomodulating adaptogens and closely monitoring for adverse reactions", "Assuming all adaptogens are safe for autoimmune conditions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Adaptogens can have immunomodulating effects, which may be beneficial or detrimental in autoimmune conditions. A cautious approach with low starting doses and careful monitoring is essential. This addresses ethical considerations and safety protocols from L5."

            "id": "q29_6",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Monitoring and Adjustment Strategies' lesson (L4), what is the MOST reliable method for tracking a client's response to an adaptogen protocol?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on subjective client feedback", "Regularly assessing objective biomarkers and utilizing validated questionnaires", "Assuming positive results if the client reports no side effects", "Ignoring client feedback to maintain objectivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Combining objective biomarkers (e.g., cortisol levels, inflammatory markers) with validated questionnaires provides a comprehensive and reliable assessment of treatment efficacy. This reduces bias and ensures accurate monitoring."
