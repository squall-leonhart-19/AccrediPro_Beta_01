        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is interested in using adaptogens to manage fatigue. Which adaptogen should be approached with the MOST caution due to its potential to modulate the immune system?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Eleuthero", "Holy Basil"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha can significantly modulate the immune system, which might exacerbate autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's. While generally beneficial for some, careful monitoring is essential, as discussed in L1."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A 62-year-old client with a history of hypertension, currently managed with lisinopril, wants to incorporate Rhodiola rosea for stress management. What is the MOST important initial step?",
            "options": ["Recommending a high dose of Rhodiola for quick results.", "Advising the client to immediately stop taking lisinopril.", "Monitoring blood pressure closely, especially during the initial weeks of Rhodiola use.", "Assuming Rhodiola is safe since it's a natural supplement."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola can have mild cardiovascular effects. Because the client is already on medication for hypertension, careful monitoring of blood pressure is crucial to prevent any adverse interactions or synergistic effects, as highlighted in L2."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on adaptogens and mental health (L3), which adaptogen is MOST likely to be contraindicated or require careful monitoring in a client taking SSRIs for depression?",
            "options": ["Eleuthero", "Schisandra", "Rhodiola rosea", "Holy Basil"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rhodiola rosea can affect serotonin levels, potentially leading to serotonin syndrome when combined with SSRIs. Therefore, it requires careful monitoring and is sometimes contraindicated in such cases, as discussed in L3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A pregnant client in her second trimester reports experiencing significant stress and fatigue. She is interested in adaptogens. Which of the following adaptogens is generally considered LEAST safe during pregnancy?",
            "options": ["Eleuthero", "Ashwagandha", "Rhodiola rosea", "None – all adaptogens are safe during pregnancy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is traditionally avoided during pregnancy due to its potential abortifacient effects and lack of sufficient safety data, as detailed in L4. While some other adaptogens might be considered with extreme caution, Ashwagandha carries a higher risk profile."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer wants to use adaptogens to help manage side effects like fatigue and nausea. Which adaptogen is MOST likely to interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and potentially affect the metabolism of chemotherapy drugs?",
            "options": ["Holy Basil", "Rhodiola rosea", "Schisandra", "Eleuthero"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Schisandra is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can affect the metabolism and efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs. This potential interaction is a significant concern when considering adaptogens for cancer patients, as explained in L5."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client with PCOS is seeking adaptogenic support for hormonal imbalance. Based on the lesson on endocrine disorders (L6), which adaptogen might be MOST beneficial in addressing insulin resistance, a common feature of PCOS?",
            "options": ["Eleuthero", "Ashwagandha", "Rhodiola rosea", "Holy Basil"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Holy Basil has shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity and regulating blood sugar levels, making it potentially beneficial for individuals with PCOS who experience insulin resistance, as discussed in L6."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client is taking multiple medications, including a beta-blocker for anxiety, a statin for cholesterol, and an NSAID for arthritis. They want to start taking Rhodiola. What is the MOST crucial consideration regarding polypharmacy?",
            "options": ["Assuming Rhodiola is safe because it's natural.", "Evaluating potential herb-drug interactions and overlapping effects.", "Ignoring potential interactions since the medications are for different conditions.", "Recommending a very high dose of Rhodiola for maximum effect."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client is on multiple medications, it's crucial to evaluate potential herb-drug interactions and overlapping effects to avoid adverse reactions or reduced medication efficacy, as emphasized in L7."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "In the THRIVE framework, what does the 'H' stand for?",
            "options": ["Hormones", "Habits", "Hope", "Holistic"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the THRIVE framework discussed in L8, 'H' stands for Hormones, representing the importance of assessing and supporting hormonal balance in complex client scenarios."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, presents with chronic fatigue, anxiety, and mild hypertension. She's also taking a low-dose thyroid medication. Using the THRIVE framework, which area should you address FIRST to build a solid foundation for adaptogen use?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending a potent adaptogen blend.", "Focusing solely on her anxiety with calming adaptogens.", "Optimizing her diet and sleep hygiene before introducing adaptogens.", "Addressing her hypertension with specific adaptogens."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the THRIVE framework (L8), establishing a solid foundation of healthy habits (diet, sleep, exercise) is crucial before introducing adaptogens. This ensures the body is receptive and maximizes the potential benefits while minimizing risks."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client with a history of estrogen-positive breast cancer, currently in remission and taking tamoxifen, wants to use adaptogens for stress management. Which adaptogen should be approached with the GREATEST caution due to potential estrogenic effects?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola rosea", "Eleuthero", "Holy Basil", "None - adaptogens don't have estrogenic effects"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While not definitively proven, some studies suggest Eleuthero might have mild estrogenic effects. Given the client's history of estrogen-positive breast cancer and current tamoxifen use, it's prudent to approach Eleuthero with caution to avoid potential interference with tamoxifen's anti-estrogenic action, as discussed in L5 and L7."
