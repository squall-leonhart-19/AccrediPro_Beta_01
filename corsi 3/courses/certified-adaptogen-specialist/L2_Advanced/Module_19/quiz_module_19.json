        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following research methodologies is generally considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the efficacy of adaptogens?",
            "options": ["Observational study", "Case series", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Expert opinion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RCTs minimize bias through randomization and control groups, providing the strongest evidence for efficacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A study on Rhodiola rosea uses a sample size of 30 participants. What is the most significant concern regarding the generalizability of the findings?",
            "options": ["The statistical power may be insufficient.", "The study duration is likely too short.", "The intervention is not clearly defined.", "Ethical considerations are not addressed."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Small sample sizes often lack the statistical power to detect meaningful differences, limiting the generalizability of the results to a larger population. A 2018 meta-analysis by Zhang et al. emphasized the importance of adequate power."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What does 'p < 0.05' typically indicate in adaptogen research?",
            "options": ["The results are clinically significant.", "There is a less than 5% probability that the observed results occurred by chance.", "The study design is flawed.", "The sample size is too small."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value less than 0.05 is a common threshold for statistical significance, suggesting the observed effect is unlikely due to random variation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A researcher discovers that a study on Ashwagandha's effects on stress has been funded by a company that manufactures Ashwagandha supplements. What type of bias should be suspected?",
            "options": ["Selection bias", "Recall bias", "Publication bias", "Conflict of interest"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Funding from a company with a vested interest in the outcome of the study creates a potential conflict of interest that could influence the results or their interpretation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which database is most comprehensive for finding peer-reviewed research on adaptogens?",
            "options": ["Wikipedia", "Google", "PubMed", "WebMD"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PubMed is a comprehensive database maintained by the National Library of Medicine, indexing biomedical literature from around the world."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In the THRIVE framework, what does the 'T' stand for?",
            "options": ["Therapeutic effect", "Transparency", "Tolerance", "Targeted intervention"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the THRIVE framework, 'T' stands for Transparency, emphasizing the importance of clear and honest reporting of research methods and results."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, reports fatigue and mild anxiety. You find a study showing Eleuthero improves stress response, but it's a small, uncontrolled trial. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend Eleuthero at the highest dose.", "Dismiss the study as irrelevant.", "Seek out larger, more rigorous studies to confirm the findings.", "Ignore the research and rely on anecdotal evidence."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Small, uncontrolled trials provide weak evidence. Seeking out stronger evidence from larger, controlled studies is crucial before making recommendations."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is a primary concern when interpreting research findings presented only in abstract form?",
            "options": ["Abstracts provide complete details of the study methodology.", "Abstracts are always peer-reviewed.", "Abstracts may not accurately represent the full study findings.", "Abstracts are sufficient for clinical decision-making."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Abstracts are brief summaries and may omit important details or present a biased view of the study results. Full-text review is essential."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of 10 studies (n=500) shows that adaptogen X reduces fatigue with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25) and a confidence interval of [0.10, 0.40]. How should this be interpreted?",
            "options": ["Adaptogen X is highly effective in reducing fatigue.", "The effect of Adaptogen X on fatigue is statistically significant but small.", "The wide confidence interval suggests the results are unreliable.", "Adaptogen X has no effect on fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While the confidence interval doesn't cross zero (indicating statistical significance), a small effect size suggests the clinical impact may be limited."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What ethical principle is MOST directly violated if a researcher fabricates data to support the efficacy of an adaptogen?",
            "options": ["Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Justice", "Integrity"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fabricating data directly violates the principle of integrity, which requires honesty and trustworthiness in research."
