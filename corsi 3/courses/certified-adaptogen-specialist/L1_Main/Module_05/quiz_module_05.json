            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical reason for establishing baseline metrics before starting an adaptogen protocol?",
            "options": ["To impress clients with data.", "To have something to compare against and measure progress.", "To fulfill regulatory requirements.", "To justify the cost of the adaptogens."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing baseline metrics provides a point of comparison for assessing the effectiveness of the adaptogen protocol. Without a baseline, it is difficult to determine whether observed changes are due to the adaptogens or other factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "A client reports a score of 6 on a 10-point subjective vitality scale at baseline. After 4 weeks on an adaptogen protocol, their score is 7. What is the MOST appropriate initial interpretation?",
            "options": ["The adaptogens are definitely working.", "The improvement is statistically significant and clinically meaningful.", "The improvement is modest and may not be solely attributable to the adaptogens.", "The protocol should be immediately discontinued."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A one-point increase on a 10-point scale is a modest improvement. While it may indicate some benefit from the adaptogens, other factors could also be contributing. Further monitoring and assessment are needed."

        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "Which objective monitoring tool is MOST suitable for assessing the impact of adaptogens on heart rate variability (HRV), a key indicator of stress resilience?",
            "options": ["A blood glucose meter.", "A wearable fitness tracker with HRV monitoring capabilities.", "A standard blood pressure cuff.", "A food diary."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Wearable fitness trackers with HRV monitoring capabilities provide a non-invasive and convenient way to track HRV over time. This data can be used to assess the impact of adaptogens on stress resilience."

            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' a 45-year-old experiencing chronic fatigue, adaptogens were combined with mindfulness meditation. What was the PRIMARY reason for incorporating mindfulness?",
            "options": ["To directly increase adaptogen absorption.", "To address the psychological component of fatigue and enhance the adaptogens' effectiveness.", "To distract Sarah from her symptoms.", "To reduce the cost of the adaptogen protocol."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation addresses the psychological component of fatigue, such as stress and anxiety, which can exacerbate symptoms. Combining it with adaptogens provides a holistic approach to improving vitality."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "After 8 weeks on an adaptogen protocol, a client's sleep quality, as measured by a sleep tracking app, has not improved. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately increase the dosage of the adaptogens.", "Discontinue the adaptogen protocol and try a different approach.", "Review the client's sleep hygiene practices and consider other complementary therapies.", "Assume the sleep tracking app is inaccurate."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If sleep quality does not improve, it's important to first review other factors that may be affecting sleep, such as sleep hygiene practices. Complementary therapies, such as relaxation techniques or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), may also be beneficial."

            "options": ["Providing infrequent, generic email updates.", "Scheduling regular check-in appointments to discuss progress and address concerns.", "Only communicating when the client reports a problem.", "Sharing irrelevant health articles."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regular check-in appointments allow for personalized feedback, address any concerns, and ensure the client is adhering to the protocol. This ongoing support is crucial for long-term success."

            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the adaptogens.", "Increase the dosage to overcome the side effects.", "Suggest taking the adaptogens with food and/or reducing the dosage temporarily.", "Tell the client that digestive upset is a normal part of the process."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mild digestive upset is a common side effect of some adaptogens. Taking them with food or reducing the dosage can often alleviate these symptoms. If symptoms persist, further investigation may be needed."
