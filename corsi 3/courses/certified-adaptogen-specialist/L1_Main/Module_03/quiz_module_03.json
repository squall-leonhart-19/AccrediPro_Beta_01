            "question": "What is the primary rationale behind cycling adaptogens in a resilience protocol?",
            "options": ["To minimize potential side effects.", "To prevent the body from adapting and reducing effectiveness.", "To reduce the overall cost of the protocol.", "To simplify the dosage schedule."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cycling adaptogens helps prevent adaptation and maintains their effectiveness over time, ensuring continued benefits as discussed in Lesson 5."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "Which integrative strategy has been shown to significantly enhance the effectiveness of adaptogens in managing stress, according to research discussed in Lesson 6?",
            "options": ["Eliminating all carbohydrates from the diet.", "Regular mindfulness meditation practice.", "Consuming large doses of vitamin C.", "Engaging in high-intensity interval training daily."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation complements adaptogens by promoting relaxation and reducing the physiological impact of stress, as highlighted in Lesson 6."

            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client on a resilience protocol reports experiencing increased anxiety after two weeks. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all adaptogens.", "Maintain the current protocol, as anxiety may be a temporary side effect.", "Reduce the dosage of adaptogens and reassess.", "Add another adaptogen to counteract the anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reducing the dosage allows you to assess whether the anxiety is dose-dependent and adjust accordingly, as emphasized in Lesson 7."
