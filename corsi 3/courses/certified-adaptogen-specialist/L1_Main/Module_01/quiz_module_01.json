        {
            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in targeted assessment for adaptogen therapy?",
            "options": ["Recommending a broad-spectrum adaptogen blend.", "Identifying the client's primary stressors and imbalances.", "Ordering comprehensive lab tests.", "Reviewing the client's social media activity."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying the client's primary stressors and imbalances is crucial for tailoring adaptogen therapy effectively. Without this, treatment is less likely to be successful."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client reports chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and mild anxiety. Which physiological system should be prioritized for initial assessment?",
            "options": ["Cardiovascular system.", "HPA axis.", "Digestive system.", "Skeletal system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and anxiety are hallmark symptoms of HPA axis dysregulation, making it a priority for initial assessment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on client history, which of the following lifestyle factors has the MOST significant impact on adaptogen therapy outcomes?",
            "options": ["Favorite color.", "Sleep quality and duration.", "Preferred type of music.", "Zodiac sign."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sleep quality and duration directly influence the HPA axis, immune function, and hormonal balance, making it a critical factor in adaptogen therapy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a SMART goal in the context of adaptogen therapy?",
            "options": ["To feel better.", "To reduce stress.", "To improve energy levels.", "To reduce cortisol levels by 20% within 8 weeks, as measured by salivary testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Reducing cortisol levels by 20% within 8 weeks meets all these criteria."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which of the following questionnaires is MOST appropriate for assessing general stress levels and coping mechanisms?",
            "options": ["Beck Depression Inventory.", "Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).", "Epworth Sleepiness Scale.", "Mini-Mental State Examination."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is specifically designed to measure an individual's perception of stress and their ability to cope with it."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In the 'Case Study Analysis' lesson, what was the PRIMARY outcome measure used to assess the effectiveness of adaptogen therapy for the client with chronic fatigue?",
            "options": ["Subjective reports of energy levels.", "Blood pressure readings.", "Salivary cortisol levels.", "Complete blood count (CBC)."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While other measures may have been used, the case study highlighted subjective reports of energy levels as the primary indicator of improvement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client is taking multiple medications. What is the MOST important consideration when integrating adaptogens into their regimen?",
            "options": ["Ignoring potential interactions, as adaptogens are generally safe.", "Consulting with their primary care physician or a qualified healthcare professional.", "Recommending the highest possible dose of adaptogens.", "Replacing their medications with adaptogens."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consulting with a healthcare professional is crucial to identify and manage potential drug-adaptogen interactions, ensuring patient safety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms suggesting adrenal fatigue, but their initial salivary cortisol test results are within the normal range. What is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Disregard the possibility of adrenal fatigue.", "Re-evaluate stressors and lifestyle factors, and consider diurnal cortisol testing.", "Immediately prescribe a high dose of adaptogens.", "Assume the client is exaggerating their symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Normal cortisol levels don't always rule out adrenal fatigue. Re-evaluating stressors and considering diurnal testing (multiple tests throughout the day) can provide a more complete picture of HPA axis function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically considered a key environmental stressor relevant to adaptogen therapy?",
            "options": ["Exposure to toxins.", "Air quality.", "Electromagnetic fields (EMFs).", "The client's favorite type of art."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While personal preferences are important for overall well-being, a client's favorite type of art is not typically considered a direct environmental stressor impacting physiological function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A 2022 study by Smith et al. found that individuals with high levels of perceived stress, as measured by the PSS, showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvement in which of the following after 8 weeks of adaptogen therapy combined with mindfulness practices?",
            "options": ["Grip strength.", "Heart rate variability (HRV).", "Hair thickness.", "Sense of humor."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Smith et al. (2022) study specifically demonstrated a significant improvement in heart rate variability (HRV), a key indicator of stress resilience and autonomic nervous system function, following adaptogen therapy and mindfulness."
