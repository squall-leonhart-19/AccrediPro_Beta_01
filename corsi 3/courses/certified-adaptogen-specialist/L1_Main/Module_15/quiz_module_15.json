            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which adaptogen is known for its potential to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and, therefore, might be most helpful in addressing symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety related to hormonal imbalances, particularly in women experiencing perimenopause?",
            "options": ["Panax Ginseng", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Maca", "Schisandra"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Panax Ginseng influences the HPA axis and can positively impact hormonal balance, potentially alleviating anxiety symptoms associated with hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "What is a key consideration when formulating adaptogen blends for cognitive enhancement, to maximize synergistic effects?",
            "options": ["Combining only adaptogens from the same botanical family", "Focusing on adaptogens with complementary mechanisms of action", "Using the highest possible dose of each adaptogen", "Including synthetic nootropics for added benefit"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synergistic adaptogen blends should combine adaptogens that work through different but complementary pathways to enhance cognitive function, such as reducing oxidative stress and modulating neurotransmitters."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the 'THRIVE Framework in Action' case studies, a client reported experiencing significant improvements in sleep quality and reduced anxiety levels after consistent use of an adaptogen protocol. Which adaptogen was MOST likely a key component of that protocol?",
            "options": ["Cordyceps", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Eleuthero"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is well-known for its calming and sleep-promoting properties, making it a likely component of a protocol designed to improve sleep and reduce anxiety."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "A client taking a prescription anticoagulant medication is considering adding an adaptogen supplement to their regimen. Which adaptogen presents the HIGHEST potential risk of interaction and requires careful monitoring?",
            "options": ["Eleuthero", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Panax Ginseng", "Holy Basil"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Panax Ginseng has known anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding when combined with prescription anticoagulant medications."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A meta-analysis published in 2023 (n=1500) investigated the effects of adaptogens on stress resilience. What was the MOST significant finding regarding the application of adaptogens in this context?",
            "options": ["Adaptogens showed no significant effect on stress resilience compared to placebo.", "Adaptogens significantly improved stress resilience, with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25).", "Adaptogens significantly improved stress resilience, with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.55).", "Adaptogens significantly worsened stress resilience in individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis found that adaptogens can significantly improve stress resilience, with a moderate effect size, suggesting a meaningful clinical benefit."
