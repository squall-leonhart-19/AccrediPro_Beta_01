        {
            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which Human Design Energy Type initiates and impacts others but does not have a defined Sacral Center?",
            "options": ["Generator", "Manifesting Generator", "Manifestor", "Projector"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Manifestors are defined by their ability to initiate and their motor center connection to the throat, without a defined Sacral Center. This initiation strategy impacts those around them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, is a Projector struggling with burnout. According to Human Design, what is the MOST likely reason for this?",
            "options": ["She is not working hard enough to prove herself.", "She is not being recognized and invited for her unique talents.", "She needs to initiate more projects on her own.", "She should focus on doing what she loves, regardless of recognition."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projectors thrive when recognized and invited. Burnout is common when they initiate without invitation or are in environments where their guidance isn't valued, as highlighted in the lesson on Energy Types."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which Authority type relies on consulting others and speaking their ideas aloud to gain clarity?",
            "options": ["Emotional Authority", "Sacral Authority", "Splenic Authority", "Ego Authority"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Emotional Authority individuals require time to process their emotions and gain clarity over time. Consulting others is not part of their decision-making process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to Human Design, what does a defined center represent?",
            "options": ["A consistent and reliable source of energy.", "An area of conditioning and vulnerability.", "A fixed and unchanging aspect of personality.", "A source of anxiety and self-doubt."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Defined centers represent areas where an individual has consistent and reliable access to energy and a fixed way of processing information. Undefined centers are open to conditioning."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "What is the primary function of a Channel in Human Design?",
            "options": ["To create division and separation between centers.", "To create a consistent flow of energy between two defined centers.", "To block the flow of energy between undefined centers.", "To create instability and unpredictability in the chart."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Channels connect two defined centers, creating a consistent and reliable flow of energy and themes associated with those centers. This creates a defined circuit."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which of the Four Arrows in the Variable indicates the ideal environment for the individual?",
            "options": ["Motivation Arrow", "Cognition Arrow", "Perspective Arrow", "Determination Arrow"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Perspective Arrow indicates the ideal environment. Left points to active, right to passive. This influences how a person best perceives and interacts with their surroundings."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client has a Profile of 3/5. What does the 3 indicate in this Profile?",
            "options": ["The unconscious role of the Martyr/Experimenter.", "The conscious role of the Martyr/Experimenter.", "The conscious role of the Hermit/Investigator.", "The unconscious role of the Hermit/Investigator."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In a 3/5 profile, the 3 represents the unconscious role of the Martyr/Experimenter, someone who learns through trial and error and often experiences chaos."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "John, a 42-year-old Generator, consistently feels frustrated at his job. Considering his Energy Type and potential conditioning, what is the MOST likely cause?",
            "options": ["He is initiating projects instead of responding to opportunities.", "He is waiting for an invitation before taking action.", "He is expressing his anger appropriately.", "He is focusing on manifesting his desires."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Generators are designed to respond to opportunities and find satisfaction in their work. Initiating without a Sacral response leads to frustration, a key indicator of being out of alignment for Generators."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "A Reflector client expresses feeling overwhelmed by taking on the emotions of others. What strategy can you suggest based on their undefined emotional center?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to suppress their emotional responses.", "Advise them to spend time in varied environments to sample different energies.", "Recommend they spend significant time alone to decondition and clear their aura.", "Suggest they surround themselves with people who have defined emotional centers."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflectors have completely open centers and are deeply affected by their environment. Spending time alone in a consistent environment allows for deconditioning and clearer self-reflection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Synthesizing the Blueprint, what is the primary goal of a holistic Human Design assessment?",
            "options": ["To predict the future with certainty.", "To identify and correct flaws in the design.", "To empower the individual with self-awareness and strategic tools.", "To categorize individuals into rigid personality types."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal is to empower individuals with an understanding of their unique design so they can make conscious choices aligned with their nature, leading to greater fulfillment and well-being. It's not about prediction or correction."
