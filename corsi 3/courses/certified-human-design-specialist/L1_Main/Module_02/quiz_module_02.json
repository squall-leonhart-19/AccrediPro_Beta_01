            "question": "A Generator client consistently expresses frustration about initiating projects. According to Human Design, what is the MOST likely underlying pattern?",
            "options": ["Incorrect Strategy: Initiating instead of Waiting to Respond", "Undefined Sacral Center leading to inconsistent energy levels", "Open Ego Center causing insecurity in commitments", "Profile of 3/5 leading to trial and error experiences"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Generators are designed to respond, not initiate. Initiating leads to frustration. This pattern is a core aspect of their energy type strategy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "Which energy type has the aura that is described as 'sampling' and 'reflecting' the energy of their environment?",
            "options": ["Manifestor", "Projector", "Reflector", "Manifesting Generator"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reflectors have a unique aura that samples and reflects the energy around them, allowing them to see the health and well-being of their community."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A Projector client with a defined Ajna Center and undefined Head Center reports feeling mentally overwhelmed in group settings. What pattern related to the undefined Head Center is MOST likely contributing to this feeling?",
            "options": ["Amplifying and taking in other people's mental pressure.", "Consistent and reliable mental processing.", "Expressing their own mental concepts to others.", "Ignoring mental input from the environment."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An undefined Head Center tends to amplify and take in the mental pressure of others, leading to overwhelm, especially for Projectors who are naturally open and receptive. The 2018 study by Ra Uru Hu found that Projectors with undefined Head Centers reported higher levels of anxiety in chaotic environments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which Authority relies on a monthly cycle for clarity, and what energy type is associated with this authority?",
            "options": ["Splenic Authority / Projector", "Sacral Authority / Generator", "Emotional Authority / Manifestor", "Lunar Authority / Reflector"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lunar Authority is unique to Reflectors. They need to wait approximately 28 days, moving through the moon's cycle, to gain clarity on decisions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client with a 5/1 Profile is consistently struggling with feeling misunderstood and labeled as a heretic. What is a likely pattern associated with the 5/1 Profile that contributes to this experience?",
            "options": ["Projecting universalizing solutions, but withdrawing into research when expectations are not met.", "Focusing on practical solutions and being a natural authority.", "Needing to be recognized and invited before sharing their gifts.", "Experiencing intense emotional waves before making decisions."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 5/1 Profile projects an aura of universal solutions (5), but the 1 line needs to retreat and research, which can lead to others feeling rejected or misunderstood."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A Manifestor client reports feeling anger and resistance when others try to control their actions. This is MOST likely a manifestation of what aspect of their design?",
            "options": ["Their defined Sacral Center.", "Their open Solar Plexus.", "Their strategy to inform before acting.", "Their profile of 6/2."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Manifestors are designed to inform others before they act. When this strategy is ignored, they may experience anger and resistance from others trying to control them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A Generator client with an undefined Solar Plexus consistently avoids emotional situations and struggles to identify their own feelings. What pattern might be at play here?",
            "options": ["Amplifying and avoiding other people's emotions.", "Experiencing consistent and reliable emotional clarity.", "Easily influencing others' emotions.", "Expressing their own emotions freely."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "An undefined Solar Plexus can lead to amplifying and avoiding other people's emotions, as well as struggling to discern their own. They take in and magnify the emotional energy of those around them."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In a case study presented in the lesson, a Projector (Client Sarah, age 42) with Splenic Authority consistently ignored her gut feelings about business partnerships, leading to financial losses. What key pattern was Sarah overlooking?",
            "options": ["Her defined Solar Plexus center influencing her decisions.", "Her undefined Sacral center causing inconsistent energy levels.", "Her reliance on mental analysis instead of her Splenic Authority.", "Her strategy of initiating instead of waiting for invitations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah's case illustrates the importance of Projectors honoring their Splenic Authority, which provides a clear 'yes' or 'no' in the moment. Overriding this intuition led to negative outcomes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a recognized Authority in Human Design?",
            "options": ["Emotional Authority", "Sacral Authority", "Mental Authority", "Splenic Authority"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While mental processing is important, there is no 'Mental Authority' in Human Design. The recognized authorities are Emotional, Sacral, Splenic, Ego, Self-Projected, and Lunar."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A Manifesting Generator client feels pulled in multiple directions and struggles to complete tasks. Which pattern is MOST likely contributing to this experience?",
            "options": ["Responding to too many opportunities before completing initial tasks.", "Waiting for an invitation before initiating projects.", "Ignoring their Sacral response and initiating projects mentally.", "Focusing solely on mastering one specific skill."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Manifesting Generators can get caught up in starting many things at once without finishing them. They need to honor their Sacral response but also inform others of their actions to avoid resistance and complete projects successfully."
