      "options": [
        "Assess Blueprint",
        "Witness Patterns",
        "Align with Strategy",
        "Release Resistance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'Witness Patterns' step in the A.W.A.R.E. Framework™ specifically addresses the exploration of recurring themes and patterns in a client's life, comparing them to their Human Design to identify areas of alignment or resistance."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_2",
      "question": "A client presents with consistent frustration and burnout, despite working hard and being dedicated. Their Human Design chart reveals they are a Generator. What is the MOST appropriate initial strategy to suggest, according to their Human Design?",
      "options": [
        "To initiate projects independently and pursue their passions relentlessly.",
        "To wait for opportunities to respond to and focus on what truly excites them.",
        "To inform others of their intentions before taking action to avoid resistance.",
        "To prioritize rest and relaxation to avoid overexertion and conserve energy."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Generators thrive by responding to opportunities. Initiating action independently can lead to frustration if it's not aligned with their sacral response. Waiting to respond ensures they engage in activities that resonate with their energy and prevent burnout."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_3",
      "question": "Which Human Design Authority relies on consistent emotional processing over time before making a decision?",
      "options": [

        "Emotional Authority",
        "Ego Authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Emotional Authority requires individuals to ride their emotional wave and gain clarity over time before making a decision. This prevents impulsive decisions based on temporary emotional states."
    },
    {
      "id": "final_4",
      "question": "A Manifestor client expresses feeling guilty about their need to initiate and impact their environment. How can you best support them in 'Releasing Resistance' according to the A.W.A.R.E. Framework™?",
      "options": [
        "Encourage them to suppress their urge to initiate to avoid disrupting others.",
        "Help them understand and accept their design, emphasizing the importance of informing others of their intentions.",
        "Suggest they focus on responding to opportunities like Generators to minimize resistance.",
        "Advise them to isolate themselves to avoid negative feedback from others."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Manifestors are designed to initiate. Guilt arises from conditioning. Understanding and accepting their design, along with informing others, reduces resistance and promotes authentic expression."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Human Design Profile provides insights into how individuals learn, interact, and express themselves, guiding them toward fulfilling their unique life purpose. While it can offer insights into relationships, it's not solely for predicting romantic compatibility."

      "explanation": "An undefined Sacral Center can lead to amplifying and mimicking the sacral energy of others, often leading to overexertion. Learning to discern when to say 'no' and prioritizing rest is crucial for managing energy levels."
