            "options": ["Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and Peppermint (Mentha piperita)", "Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and Cedarwood (Cedrus atlantica)", "Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) and Tea Tree (Melaleuca alternifolia)", "Cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) and Clove (Syzygium aromaticum)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "For a client with Rheumatoid Arthritis experiencing morning stiffness, which application method of essential oils would likely provide the MOST immediate relief?",
            "options": ["A full-body aromatherapy massage", "A warm compress applied to the affected joints", "A daily aromatherapy bath", "A diffuser blend used throughout the day"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A warm compress allows for targeted application of heat and essential oils directly to the painful joints, providing quicker relief from morning stiffness compared to other methods. A full-body massage may be too intense, and a diffuser or bath offers a less concentrated approach."

            "explanation": "Collaboration with the client's medical team is paramount.

            "explanation": "Rotating essential oils is crucial to prevent sensitization and maintain the therapeutic effects over time.
