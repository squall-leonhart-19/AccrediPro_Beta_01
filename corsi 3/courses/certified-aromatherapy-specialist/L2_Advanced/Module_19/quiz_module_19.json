        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following study designs is generally considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the efficacy of an aromatherapy intervention?",
            "options": ["Case Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)", "Observational Study", "Expert Opinion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs minimize bias through randomization and control groups, allowing for stronger causal inferences about the intervention's effect."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A researcher reports a p-value of 0.06 for their aromatherapy intervention. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The results are statistically significant.", "The results are likely due to chance.", "The results are clinically significant.", "The results are not statistically significant at the conventional alpha level of 0.05."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 exceeds the conventional significance level of 0.05, meaning the observed effect is not statistically significant and could be due to chance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is a key characteristic of a double-blind study?",
            "options": ["Only the participants are unaware of their treatment assignment.", "Only the researchers are unaware of the participants' treatment assignment.", "Both the participants and the researchers are unaware of the treatment assignments.", "The study involves two different aromatherapy interventions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a double-blind study, neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving the active treatment, minimizing bias in both reporting and assessment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "You are evaluating an aromatherapy study and notice the sample size is very small (n=15). What is a primary concern regarding the study's findings?",
            "options": ["The study is likely to have high statistical power.", "The study's findings are easily generalizable to the wider population.", "The study may lack statistical power to detect a true effect.", "The study is likely to be free from bias."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Small sample sizes often lack the statistical power to detect meaningful effects, increasing the risk of a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which database is a comprehensive resource for biomedical literature, including many aromatherapy-related studies?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed/MEDLINE", "Cochrane Library", "Web of Science"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed/MEDLINE is a widely used database providing access to citations and abstracts of biomedical literature, including a significant number of aromatherapy studies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A client, Sarah (age 45), reports experiencing mild anxiety. Based on evidence-based aromatherapy, which essential oil, administered via inhalation, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms in several RCTs?",
            "options": ["Peppermint", "Rosemary", "Lavender", "Tea Tree"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled lavender essential oil in reducing anxiety symptoms. For example, a 2013 meta-analysis in *Phytomedicine* confirmed this effect (n=11 studies)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is a 'systematic review' in the context of aromatherapy research?",
            "options": ["A review of all available aromatherapy products on the market.", "A review that only includes studies published in a specific journal.", "A comprehensive and unbiased review of the literature on a specific research question, using explicit methods.", "A review based solely on the opinion of expert aromatherapists."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews use rigorous and transparent methods to identify, evaluate, and synthesize all relevant studies on a specific topic, minimizing bias and providing a comprehensive overview of the evidence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a potential ethical concern when conducting aromatherapy research?",
            "options": ["Using a control group that receives no treatment.", "Failing to disclose potential conflicts of interest.", "Obtaining informed consent from participants.", "Ensuring the privacy of participant data."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Failing to disclose potential conflicts of interest, such as funding from an essential oil company, can compromise the integrity and objectivity of the research."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In the context of aromatherapy research, what does the term 'effect size' refer to?",
            "options": ["The number of participants in a study.", "The statistical significance of the results.", "The magnitude of the difference between the treatment and control groups.", "The cost of the aromatherapy intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effect size quantifies the magnitude of the difference between groups, providing a measure of the practical significance of the intervention beyond statistical significance. A larger effect size indicates a stronger effect."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is a potential future direction in aromatherapy research that could enhance its scientific rigor?",
            "options": ["Reliance solely on anecdotal evidence.", "Ignoring the placebo effect.", "Investigating the specific mechanisms of action of essential oils using advanced techniques.", "Avoiding the use of control groups."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Investigating the specific mechanisms of action of essential oils, such as their effects on neurotransmitters or the immune system, using advanced techniques like neuroimaging or metabolomics, can strengthen the scientific basis of aromatherapy."
