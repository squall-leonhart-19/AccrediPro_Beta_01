            "question": "Which element of the S.C.E.N.T. Framework™ focuses on identifying potential contraindications and interactions?",
            "options": ["Setting", "Client History", "Essential Oil Selection", "Technique"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'C' in S.C.E.N.T. stands for 'Client History,' which encompasses gathering information about allergies, medical conditions, medications, and other factors that may influence the safety and efficacy of the aromatherapy treatment."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing mild skin irritation after using a 3% dilution of lavender essential oil in jojoba oil. What is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue all aromatherapy treatments.", "Reduce the dilution to 1% and re-assess.", "Apply a corticosteroid cream to the affected area.", "Increase the dilution to 5% to enhance therapeutic effects."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing the dilution is the most conservative and appropriate first step. A lower concentration minimizes the risk of further irritation while still allowing for potential therapeutic benefits. Discontinuing all treatments is too drastic initially, and increasing the dilution would likely exacerbate the problem."

            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice involves critically evaluating research and integrating it with clinical expertise and client preferences. Applying research findings indiscriminately is inappropriate."
