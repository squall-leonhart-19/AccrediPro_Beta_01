            "options": ["Combining oils with similar chemical profiles for enhanced effect.", "Using only oils from the same botanical family to avoid adverse reactions.", "Creating a blend where the combined effect of the oils is greater than the sum of their individual effects.", "Diluting potent oils with milder ones to reduce irritation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Synergistic blending aims to create a blend where the interaction of the oils results in a more powerful or beneficial effect than simply adding their individual properties together."
