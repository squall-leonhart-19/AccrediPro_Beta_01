            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY goal of sensory assessment in aromatherapy?",
            "options": ["Determining the chemical composition of an essential oil.", "Identifying a client's emotional response to specific aromas.", "Predicting the cost-effectiveness of different essential oils.", "Diagnosing medical conditions based on olfactory cues."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sensory assessment focuses on understanding a client's subjective experience and emotional responses to aromas, guiding personalized aromatherapy interventions."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on olfaction physiology, which receptor type is primarily responsible for detecting odor molecules?",
            "options": ["Mechanoreceptors", "Nociceptors", "Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)", "Thermoreceptors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are specialized neurons in the nasal cavity that bind to odor molecules, initiating the olfactory signaling pathway."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In the context of direct inhalation, what is the recommended duration for an initial aromatic exposure to assess a client's reaction?",
            "options": ["30-60 seconds", "5-10 seconds", "2-3 minutes", "15-20 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A brief initial exposure of 5-10 seconds allows for a quick assessment of the client's immediate reaction without overwhelming their olfactory system."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which environmental diffusion method is LEAST suitable for clients with asthma or respiratory sensitivities?",
            "options": ["Nebulizing diffuser", "Ultrasonic diffuser", "Passive diffuser (reed diffuser)", "Personal inhaler"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nebulizing diffusers disperse essential oil molecules directly into the air without water, creating a higher concentration of airborne particles that may irritate sensitive airways. Ultrasonic diffusers produce a fine mist with water, which is generally better tolerated."

            "options": ["Encourage the client to try a higher dilution of lavender.", "Dismiss the aversion as a temporary preference.", "Immediately discontinue the use of lavender and explore alternative oils.", "Suggest combining lavender with a more appealing essential oil to mask the scent."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Respecting the client's aversion is paramount. Immediately discontinuing use and exploring alternative oils ensures their comfort and safety."

            "options": ["Increase the concentration of essential oils in the diffuser.", "Encourage the client to ignore the symptoms and continue exposure.", "Remove the client from the aromatic environment and provide fresh air.", "Administer an antihistamine to reduce the allergic reaction."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Removing the client from the aromatic environment and providing fresh air is the most immediate and effective way to alleviate symptoms of sensory overload."
