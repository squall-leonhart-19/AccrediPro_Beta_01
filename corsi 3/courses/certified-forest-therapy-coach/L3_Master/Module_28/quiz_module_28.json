            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate first action when a participant discloses active suicidal ideation during a forest therapy walk?",
            "options": ["Maintain a calm demeanor and directly ask about their intent and plan.", "Immediately end the walk and call emergency services.", "Attempt to distract the participant with nature-based activities.", "Encourage the participant to journal about their feelings in a secluded area."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Directly assessing the intent and plan is crucial for immediate safety assessment. While emergency services may be needed, gathering information first allows for a more informed response."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client with a history of complex trauma becomes triggered by a sudden loud noise during a forest therapy session. Which intervention is MOST likely to be helpful?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to immediately confront the source of the noise.", "Facilitating a grounding exercise, such as focusing on the sensations of their feet on the earth.", "Ignoring the client's reaction to avoid reinforcing the triggering stimulus.", "Immediately ending the session and rescheduling for a later date."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises help to bring the client back to the present moment and regulate their nervous system, which is crucial in managing trauma responses."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A Forest Therapy Coach suspects a client is experiencing vicarious trauma. Which of the following is the MOST effective self-care strategy?",
            "options": ["Increasing the number of client sessions to feel more effective.", "Engaging in regular peer supervision and debriefing.", "Avoiding discussing difficult client cases with anyone.", "Focusing solely on personal achievements to counterbalance negative feelings."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peer supervision provides a safe space to process difficult emotions and experiences related to client work, mitigating the impact of vicarious trauma. A 2021 study by Stamm found that social support significantly reduces burnout in helping professionals."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a dual relationship that could create an ethical dilemma for a Forest Therapy Coach?",
            "options": ["Referring a client to a local physician for medical evaluation.", "Providing forest therapy sessions to a close friend.", "Attending a continuing education workshop on trauma-informed care.", "Maintaining professional boundaries and confidentiality with all clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing therapy to a close friend creates a dual relationship, blurring professional boundaries and potentially compromising objectivity and client well-being. Standard 3.05 of the APA Ethics Code addresses multiple relationships."

            "question": "A client with co-occurring depression and substance use disorder expresses a desire to stop taking their prescribed medication due to side effects. What is the MOST appropriate course of action for the Forest Therapy Coach?",
            "options": ["Advise the client to immediately stop taking the medication.", "Encourage the client to discuss their concerns with their prescribing physician or psychiatrist.", "Adjust the client's medication dosage based on their reported side effects.", "Tell the client that the side effects are probably temporary and they should continue the medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forest Therapy Coaches are not qualified to provide medical advice. Referring the client back to their prescribing physician ensures appropriate medical management and avoids potential harm."

            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on grief and loss, which of the following activities is MOST likely to be helpful for a client processing the death of a loved one during a forest therapy session?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to immediately move on and focus on positive aspects of life.", "Facilitating a mindful walk where the client can connect with nature's cycles of death and rebirth.", "Avoiding any discussion of the loss to prevent triggering painful emotions.", "Promising the client that everything will be alright and their pain will disappear soon."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Connecting with nature's cycles can provide a sense of continuity and acceptance, facilitating the grieving process. A 2019 study in the *Journal of Palliative Medicine* found that nature-based interventions reduced grief symptoms."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'safety plan' when working with clients at risk of suicide?",
            "options": ["To guarantee the client will not attempt suicide.", "To provide a written guide for the client and their support system during a crisis.", "To shift responsibility for the client's safety to another party.", "To document the client's suicidal thoughts for legal purposes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A safety plan is a collaborative document that outlines coping strategies, support contacts, and steps to take during a suicidal crisis. It is not a guarantee of safety but a tool to increase it. A study by Stanley & Brown (2012) showed safety plans reduce suicidal behavior."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "During a forest therapy walk, a client reveals they are experiencing auditory hallucinations. What is the MOST appropriate immediate response?",
            "options": ["Dismiss the hallucinations as a product of their imagination.", "Validate their experience without reinforcing the reality of the hallucinations, and assess their level of distress and safety.", "Encourage them to confront the voices and tell them to go away.", "Immediately call emergency services and have them transported to a psychiatric facility."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Validating the client's experience acknowledges their distress without necessarily agreeing with the content of the hallucinations. Assessing their safety and level of distress is the priority. Emergency services are only necessary if there is an immediate risk to self or others."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A Forest Therapy Coach is working with a client who has a history of domestic violence. Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when planning a session?",
            "options": ["Choosing a location that is secluded and difficult to access.", "Ensuring the client has a reliable way to communicate and leave the session if needed.", "Focusing on activities that promote vulnerability and emotional expression.", "Avoiding any discussion of the client's past experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety and access to support are paramount for clients with a history of domestic violence. Ensuring they can easily communicate and leave the session empowers them and reduces the risk of re-traumatization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "In the advanced case study analysis, what was a key factor that contributed to a positive outcome for a client with chronic pain and anxiety participating in a forest therapy program?",
            "options": ["The client's immediate and complete elimination of all pain symptoms.", "The client's development of coping mechanisms and increased self-efficacy in managing their symptoms.", "The coach's ability to provide medical advice and prescribe pain medication.", "The client's complete isolation from their social support network."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case studies highlighted the importance of developing coping mechanisms and self-efficacy in managing chronic conditions, rather than expecting a complete cure. A 2023 review in *Complementary Therapies in Medicine* supports the use of nature-based interventions for chronic pain management."
