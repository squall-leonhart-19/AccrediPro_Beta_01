            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The question prompting 'If this challenge were a tree...' directly encourages metaphorical thinking by asking the participant to relate their experience to a natural element, fostering deeper self-reflection. Case studies within our program show that this technique helps clients reframe challenges with new perspectives."
