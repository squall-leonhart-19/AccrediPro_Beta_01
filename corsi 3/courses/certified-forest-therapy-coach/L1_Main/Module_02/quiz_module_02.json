            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research consistently highlights the role of phytoncides, airborne chemicals released by trees, in reducing stress hormones like cortisol. A 2011 study by Park et al. in Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine demonstrated a 13.4% reduction in cortisol levels in participants exposed to forest environments compared to urban environments."
