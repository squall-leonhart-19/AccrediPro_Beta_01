            "options": ["Nature Connectedness", "Novelty", "Nurturing Environment", "Narrative"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in the N.A.T.U.R.E. Framework™ represents Nature Connectedness, a core element of Forest Therapy practice and a key outcome studied in research."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key consideration when critically evaluating research on modalities related to Forest Therapy, such as horticultural therapy or wilderness therapy?",
            "options": ["The sample size is always large enough.", "The study design is always a randomized controlled trial.", "The specific elements of the intervention are clearly defined and replicable.", "The study only includes participants from a single cultural background."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A clearly defined and replicable intervention is crucial for determining if the results are transferable and applicable to Forest Therapy practice."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A client reports reading an article claiming Forest Therapy cures depression. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate response, based on the evidence presented in the module?",
            "options": ["Agree enthusiastically to build rapport.", "Cite a specific research study that proves this claim.", "Acknowledge the potential benefits for mood while emphasizing that Forest Therapy is not a replacement for medical treatment and further research is needed.", "Dismiss the client's statement as completely unfounded."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It's essential to acknowledge potential mood benefits while clarifying that Forest Therapy is not a substitute for medical care and that research is ongoing. This balances client expectations with scientific accuracy."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "What is the primary function of Natural Killer (NK) cells, a key biomarker often studied in Forest Therapy research?",
            "options": ["To produce antibodies against pathogens", "To regulate blood sugar levels", "To identify and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells", "To transport oxygen throughout the body"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NK cells play a critical role in the immune system by targeting and eliminating compromised cells, contributing to overall health and well-being."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A study uses a p-value of 0.06 to determine statistical significance. Using the conventional threshold of p < 0.05, would the results be considered statistically significant?",
            "options": ["Yes, because 0.06 is less than 0.05", "Yes, because 0.06 is close to 0.05", "No, because 0.06 is greater than 0.05", "It cannot be determined from the information given"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is greater than the conventional threshold of 0.05, meaning the results are not considered statistically significant by conventional standards."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Which research design is generally considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention like Forest Therapy?",
            "options": ["Case study", "Cross-sectional survey", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Qualitative interview study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RCTs, with random assignment to treatment and control groups, are the most rigorous design for establishing cause-and-effect relationships."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what is a potential future direction for Forest Therapy research?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on subjective well-being outcomes", "Ignoring the role of specific environmental elements", "Investigating the long-term effects of regular Forest Therapy practice on chronic conditions", "Limiting research to Japanese populations"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Longitudinal studies examining the impact of Forest Therapy on chronic health conditions represent a promising avenue for future research."

            "options": ["High-intensity physical exercise", "Mindful sensory engagement with the natural environment", "Competitive group activities", "Extended periods of social isolation in nature"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that mindful sensory engagement, a core element of Forest Therapy, is particularly effective in reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation."
