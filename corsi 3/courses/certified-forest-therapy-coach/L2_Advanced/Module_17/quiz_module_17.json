            "question": "A client discloses during a forest therapy session that they are experiencing suicidal ideation. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action?",
            "options": ["Continue the session as planned, carefully monitoring the client.", "Attempt to explore the reasons behind the suicidal ideation in detail.", "Immediately contact emergency services or a crisis hotline and ensure the client's safety.", "Suggest the client try some grounding exercises and then return to the session."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Safety is the paramount concern. Immediate contact with emergency services or a crisis hotline is crucial to ensure the client's well-being and access to appropriate support."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "During a forest therapy walk, a client with a history of trauma suddenly becomes dissociative, reporting feeling detached from their body and surroundings. Which intervention is MOST likely to be helpful initially?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to focus on vivid mental imagery to reconnect with the present.", "Gently guiding the client to engage their senses with the environment, such as noticing the texture of a leaf or the sound of birds.", "Asking the client to describe the traumatic event in detail to process their emotions.", "Administering a prescribed anti-anxiety medication, if available."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques that engage the senses are generally effective for bringing someone back to the present moment and reducing dissociation. Asking about the trauma too soon can be re-traumatizing."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that forest therapy can be a valuable tool for managing chronic pain, reducing pain intensity, and improving quality of life, even if it doesn't completely eliminate pain."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing forest therapy to a close friend or family member creates a dual relationship, which can compromise objectivity, blur boundaries, and potentially harm the therapeutic relationship."

            "explanation": "Providing a quiet space and offering modifications acknowledges the client's sensory sensitivities and allows them to regulate their experience, promoting a sense of safety and control."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle engagement with nature and validation of feelings can help to foster a sense of connection and hope, while avoiding direct challenges to negative thoughts, which can be counterproductive."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pressuring a client to disclose details about traumatic events can be re-traumatizing and is outside the scope of forest therapy. It is crucial to prioritize the client's safety and comfort and avoid pushing them beyond their capacity."
