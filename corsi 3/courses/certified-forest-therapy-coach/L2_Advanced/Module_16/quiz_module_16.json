            "options": ["A challenging hike to a scenic overlook.", "A mindful sit spot practice focused on sensory observation.", "A group forest bathing session with guided meditation on acceptance.", "An intensive journaling exercise in a secluded area of the forest."],

            "question": "According to the principles outlined in L3, which neurotransmitter is MOST directly affected by nature immersion, contributing to reduced cravings and improved mood in individuals recovering from addiction?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "GABA", "Norepinephrine"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Nature immersion can help regulate dopamine levels, which are often dysregulated in individuals with addiction, contributing to cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The re-regulation supports a more balanced reward system."
