            "question": "Which art therapy technique is MOST directly aligned with helping trauma survivors regain a sense of control and agency?",
            "options": ["Mandala creation", "Free drawing with pastels", "Creating a safety plan through visual imagery", "Sculpting abstract forms"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating a safety plan through visual imagery empowers the survivor to actively participate in their safety and recovery, fostering a sense of control often lost during traumatic experiences. This aligns with Judith Herman's stage-based trauma recovery model, emphasizing safety and stabilization first."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A client in addiction recovery is experiencing intense cravings. Which art-making directive would be MOST appropriate to help them process this experience in the moment?",
            "options": ["Creating a detailed self-portrait", "Drawing the craving as a monster or external force", "Designing a vision board for their future recovery", "Painting a landscape from memory"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Externalizing the craving as a monster allows the client to separate themselves from the experience and begin to understand its power and influence, a key step in managing triggers and cravings. This is supported by research showing the efficacy of externalization techniques in addiction recovery (e.g., Denborough, 2006)."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to honor the memory of the deceased and facilitate a continued sense of connection, which is essential for healthy grieving. This aligns with the concept of 'continuing bonds' theory in grief counseling (Klass, Silverman, & Nickman, 1996)."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Guided imagery with watercolor painting allows for immediate stress reduction by focusing on calming images and engaging in a simple, relaxing art-making process. Studies have shown that guided imagery can reduce anxiety and pain in medical settings (e.g., Kossak, 2009)."

            "options": ["Oil paints", "Clay", "Charcoal", "Digital art software"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clay is often highly accessible as it provides a tactile and sensory experience that can bypass the need for complex verbal expression. Its malleability also allows for immediate and direct communication of emotions and ideas, especially for individuals with sensory processing differences common in neurodivergent populations."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A collaborative mural painting encourages social interaction, shared creativity, and a sense of belonging, directly addressing feelings of loneliness and isolation. Group art therapy activities are often beneficial for older adults in fostering social connections (e.g., Stuckey & Nobel, 2010)."

            "explanation": "Working with wet clay on a pottery wheel requires sustained focus and control, which can be challenging for individuals with ADHD and impulsivity.
