            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective first step in identifying recurring themes in a client's artwork?",
            "options": ["Immediately interpreting the symbolism.", "Focusing on the client's verbal descriptions of the artwork.", "Looking for repeated images, colors, or compositional elements across multiple pieces.", "Ignoring individual pieces and focusing on the overall aesthetic."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying recurring themes requires a systematic review of multiple artworks to notice repeated elements. Starting with the client's verbal descriptions can be helpful but should follow observation of the artwork itself."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "A client consistently uses the color black predominantly in their artwork. According to the lesson on color associations, what is the MOST cautious and ethical interpretation of this pattern?",
            "options": ["The client is undoubtedly depressed.", "The client is likely expressing grief or mourning, but further exploration is needed.", "The client has a fascination with darkness and negativity.", "The client is artistic and using black for dramatic effect."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While black can be associated with negative emotions like grief or mourning, it's crucial to avoid definitive interpretations. Further exploration with the client is necessary to understand their personal association with the color."

            "question": "In analyzing compositional patterns, what does 'centralization' in a drawing MOST often suggest?",
            "options": ["A feeling of isolation and loneliness.", "A strong sense of self and focus.", "A desire to connect with others.", "A chaotic and disorganized thought process."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Centralization, where the main subject is placed in the center of the artwork, often suggests a strong sense of self-focus or importance of the subject to the artist. However, it's important to consider the context of the artwork and the client's personal experiences."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Depicting oneself as a child in artwork often suggests an exploration of past experiences and identity formation. While it could indicate trauma or regression, those possibilities should be explored with sensitivity, not assumed."

            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "According to the VISUAL framework, where does the 'Understanding Patterns' stage primarily fit?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the VISUAL framework, 'Understanding Patterns' follows 'Initiating the Therapeutic Relationship' because establishing trust and rapport provides a safe space for exploring potentially sensitive themes revealed through recurring patterns. It is a key step before assessment and verbal reflection."

            "explanation": "Documenting patterns helps track changes over time, identify emerging themes, and inform treatment planning. It allows the therapist to monitor progress and adjust interventions accordingly. Sharing with other professionals requires the client's explicit consent."
