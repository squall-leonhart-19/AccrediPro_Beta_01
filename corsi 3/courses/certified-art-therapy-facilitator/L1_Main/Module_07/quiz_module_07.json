            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "In the 'Interpret Imagery' (I) stage, what is the MOST important guideline to follow when discussing potential symbolic meanings with a client?",
            "options": ["Present your interpretations as definitive and authoritative.", "Focus solely on universally accepted symbolic meanings.", "Encourage the client to explore their OWN personal associations and interpretations.", "Avoid discussing symbolism altogether to prevent influencing the client."],
