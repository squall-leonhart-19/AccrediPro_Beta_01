            "question": "Which legal structure offers the most liability protection for an art therapy practice, separating personal assets from business debts?",
            "options": ["Sole Proprietorship", "Partnership", "Limited Liability Company (LLC)", "S-Corporation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An LLC provides a legal shield, protecting personal assets from business liabilities.  Sole proprietorships and partnerships do not offer this separation, and S-Corporations, while offering some benefits, have more complex requirements than an LLC in most states."

            "id": "q32_2",
            "question": "According to the financial management lesson, what is the primary benefit of creating a detailed budget for your art therapy practice?",
            "options": ["Minimizing tax liabilities", "Maximizing client referrals", "Tracking income and expenses to inform financial decisions", "Guaranteeing profitability"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A budget allows you to understand your financial inflows and outflows, enabling informed decisions about spending, investment, and pricing strategies. While budgeting can indirectly impact profitability and tax planning, its primary function is tracking and informing."

            "question": "A new art therapist, Sarah, is deciding on a marketing strategy. Considering the lesson on client acquisition, which of the following is generally the MOST cost-effective initial marketing approach?",
            "options": ["Running paid advertisements on social media", "Attending local community events and offering free introductory workshops", "Hiring a public relations firm", "Sponsoring a large charity gala"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attending community events and offering workshops builds rapport and trust organically, often proving more cost-effective initially than paid advertising or PR, especially for a new practice with a limited budget. Paid advertising can be effective, but requires careful targeting and budgeting."

            "id": "q32_4",
            "question": "Regarding insurance billing, what is a 'CPT code' and why is it important?",
            "options": ["A code representing the therapist's qualifications; used for credentialing.", "A code representing the client's diagnosis; used for treatment planning.", "A standardized code representing a specific medical or therapeutic service; used for billing insurance companies.", "A code representing the art materials used in therapy; used for inventory management."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CPT codes are essential for accurately billing insurance companies for the specific services provided during art therapy sessions.  Incorrect or missing CPT codes can lead to claim denials."

            "id": "q32_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically a consideration when optimizing your art therapy space?",
            "options": ["Accessibility for clients with disabilities", "Adequate ventilation and lighting", "The therapist's personal art collection display", "Storage for art supplies"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a therapist's personal art collection can contribute to the ambiance, it is less critical than accessibility, safety (ventilation), functionality (storage), and creating a therapeutic environment for clients.  Accessibility and safety are paramount concerns."

        {
            "id": "q32_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on technology, what is a primary benefit of using Electronic Health Records (EHR) software in your art therapy practice?",
            "options": ["Eliminating the need for professional liability insurance", "Automating art supply ordering", "Streamlining administrative tasks and improving record-keeping efficiency", "Guaranteeing client confidentiality"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "EHR software helps manage client records, appointments, billing, and other administrative tasks, saving time and reducing errors. While EHRs can enhance security, they do not guarantee confidentiality; proper security measures are still necessary. They also do not eliminate the need for professional liability insurance."

            "question": "To build a sustainable art therapy business, what is the significance of 'diversifying your income streams'?",
            "options": ["Focusing exclusively on individual therapy sessions", "Relying solely on insurance reimbursement", "Generating revenue from multiple sources, such as workshops, groups, and consultation services", "Minimizing marketing expenses"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diversifying income reduces financial risk by not depending solely on one source of revenue. This could include offering workshops, group sessions, supervision, or selling art supplies in addition to individual therapy."

        {
            "id": "q32_8",
            "question": "In the context of risk management, what is the purpose of having a detailed 'crisis plan' for your art therapy practice?",
            "options": ["To guarantee that no crises will ever occur", "To provide a framework for responding effectively to unexpected events, such as a client emergency or natural disaster", "To eliminate the need for professional liability insurance", "To solely focus on financial crises"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A crisis plan outlines steps to take in various emergency situations, ensuring a prepared and effective response. It does not prevent crises but mitigates their impact. While financial aspects are important, a crisis plan covers a broader range of potential emergencies."

            "id": "q32_9",
            "question": "Case Study: An art therapist, David, accepts a client referral from his friend, without disclosing the pre-existing relationship to the client. What ethical principle is David MOST likely violating?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Integrity/Conflict of Interest"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Accepting a referral without disclosing the pre-existing relationship represents a conflict of interest and compromises David's integrity. It could potentially influence his objectivity and impartiality in providing therapy."

        {
            "id": "q32_10",
            "question": "What is the MOST effective way to protect client confidentiality when using online platforms for art therapy sessions?",
            "options": ["Using any readily available video conferencing platform.", "Asking clients to sign a waiver releasing you from all responsibility for data breaches.", "Ensuring the platform is HIPAA compliant and implementing secure communication practices.", "Relying solely on the platform's privacy policy without taking additional security measures."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HIPAA compliance ensures the platform meets specific security standards for protecting health information. Secure communication practices, such as encryption and password protection, further safeguard client data. A platform's privacy policy alone is insufficient, and waivers do not absolve the therapist of their ethical and legal obligations."
