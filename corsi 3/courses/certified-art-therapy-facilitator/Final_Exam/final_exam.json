      "explanation": "Maintaining confidentiality is paramount when working with minors, but it must be balanced with legal and ethical obligations, such as reporting suspected abuse or neglect. Sharing artwork or interpretations without consent violates the minor's autonomy and trust. Focusing solely on aesthetics neglects the therapeutic potential of art."

      "explanation": "The most appropriate initial response is to acknowledge the client's expression and explore their feelings about the artwork.
