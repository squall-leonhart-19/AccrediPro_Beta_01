            "question": "In advanced clay work for trauma, which of the following is MOST crucial for creating a safe and containing therapeutic environment?",
            "options": ["Encouraging immediate representation of traumatic events.", "Maintaining a directive approach to guide the client's creation.", "Establishing clear boundaries and emphasizing the client's control over the process.", "Focusing on achieving a specific aesthetic outcome."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing clear boundaries and client control is paramount in trauma work to foster safety and prevent re-traumatization. A non-directive approach allows the client to lead the process at their own pace."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "A client using sandplay therapy consistently places a small, enclosed figure in the lower left corner of the tray. According to Jungian principles, what might this placement MOST likely symbolize?",
            "options": ["Future aspirations and goals.", "The conscious ego striving for dominance.", "Unresolved issues from the past or the unconscious shadow.", "A desire for social connection and belonging."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lower left corner often represents the past and the unconscious, while enclosed figures can symbolize feelings of entrapment or unresolved issues. Jungian analysis emphasizes understanding these symbolic placements within the client's broader narrative."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "When using altered books to help a client re-author their life narrative, which technique is MOST effective for challenging negative core beliefs?",
            "options": ["Removing all negative words and images from the book.", "Focusing solely on positive memories and experiences.", "Juxtaposing negative beliefs with counter-evidence and alternative perspectives.", "Creating a completely new story unrelated to the client's life."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most effective approach is to directly address and challenge negative core beliefs by presenting counter-evidence and alternative perspectives within the altered book. This allows for a tangible and visual representation of cognitive restructuring."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Red can symbolize anger or energy, and sharp lines on the periphery often suggest boundary issues or a defensive posture. The concentration of these elements indicates that these feelings are dominant and possibly unresolved."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most appropriate approach is to explore the underlying emotions and experiences that may be contributing to the fragmented expression. This allows the client to process and integrate these experiences, rather than simply suppressing or re-interpreting them."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "When working with clients who have experienced complex trauma, it is crucial to proceed with sensitivity and respect their pace. Allowing them to explore themes of resilience, hope, and self-compassion provides a safe and gradual entry point into processing their experiences. Forcing direct confrontation can be re-traumatizing."
