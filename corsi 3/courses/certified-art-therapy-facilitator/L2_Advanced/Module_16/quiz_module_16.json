            "question": "In a case study involving complex trauma and dissociation, which art directive is MOST likely to help a client begin to externalize their trauma narrative safely?",
            "options": ["Creating a self-portrait focusing on positive attributes.", "Drawing a 'safe space' or 'inner sanctuary'.", "Sculpting a representation of their earliest memory.", "Painting an abstract representation of their dissociative experiences without specific details."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 70-year-old client with mild cognitive impairment and experiencing grief after the loss of their spouse is participating in art therapy. Which art intervention would be MOST appropriate to facilitate emotional expression and connection?",
            "options": ["Detailed representational painting of their spouse.", "Collaborative art-making with other group members, creating a shared memory quilt.", "Abstract expressionist painting focused on releasing pent-up emotions.", "Complex collage requiring fine motor skills and detailed planning."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

The shared memory quilt fosters connection and allows for reminiscence."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Addressing underlying trauma in addiction recovery helps clients understand the root causes of their substance use and develop healthier coping mechanisms for managing triggers and emotional distress. This reduces the likelihood of relapse."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Imagery in art therapy is highly personal. Birds flying away *could* symbolize freedom, release, or the departed. The therapist should explore the client's individual associations with the image to understand its specific meaning within their grief process."

            "explanation": "While cognitive stimulation is beneficial, forcing complex artwork on geriatric patients with cognitive decline can lead to frustration and anxiety. Art directives should be adapted to their abilities and focused on emotional expression and enjoyment, not cognitive challenge."
