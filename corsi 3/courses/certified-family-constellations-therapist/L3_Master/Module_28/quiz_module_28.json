            "explanation": "Balancing the duty to protect with the client's right to self-determination is paramount. While documentation is important, and confidentiality is generally maintained, the immediate safety of the client takes precedence when suicidal risk is high."

            "options": ["Identifying specific individuals responsible for the client's distress.", "Uncovering hidden loyalties, entanglements, and unfinished business within the family system.", "Prescribing specific behavioral changes for family members.", "Focusing solely on the client's individual psychological history."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Family Constellations seeks to reveal unconscious dynamics, hidden loyalties, and unresolved traumas that may be contributing to the client's suicidal ideation. It's not about blame, but about understanding systemic patterns."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The immediate priority is always the client's safety and well-being. This may involve assessing current risk, providing support, and connecting them with appropriate resources. Referral to a specialist is also crucial, but not the *first* action."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex trauma, often resulting from prolonged or repeated abuse, can lead to dissociation and fragmented experiences. A gentler, phased approach is necessary to avoid overwhelming the client."

How did addressing this systemic issue likely contribute to Sarah's recovery?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the unresolved grief helped Sarah connect with the root cause of her addiction, providing an opportunity for healing and healthier coping mechanisms. This systemic approach acknowledges the interconnectedness of emotions and behaviors."
