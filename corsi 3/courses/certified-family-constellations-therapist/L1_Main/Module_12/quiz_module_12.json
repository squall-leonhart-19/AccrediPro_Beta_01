            "question": "In the context of advanced Family Constellations work with complex trauma, what is the primary goal of Empathetic Resolution?",
            "options": ["To completely erase the traumatic memory.", "To help the client understand the logical reasons behind the trauma.", "To facilitate a felt sense of understanding and compassion towards all involved, including perpetrators, to promote healing and integration.", "To identify and blame the root cause of the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Empathetic Resolution aims to create a felt sense of understanding and compassion, fostering healing and integration within the system. It doesn't seek to erase memories or assign blame."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons on Deepening Meaning Integration, what is a core characteristic of limiting beliefs that contribute to systemic issues?",
            "options": ["They are always consciously held and easily identified.", "They are often unconscious, generalized, and maintained through repetitive patterns and emotional attachments.", "They are easily resolved through logical reasoning and positive affirmations.", "They only affect the individual holding the belief and have no impact on the family system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Limiting beliefs are typically unconscious, generalized, and reinforced by recurring patterns and emotional connections, impacting the entire family system. As seen in the case studies, these beliefs often operate outside of conscious awareness."

            "options": ["Client intellectualizing and avoiding emotional engagement.", "Sudden and unexplained physical discomfort experienced by representatives.", "Unwillingness to acknowledge the impact of past events.", "Immediate and complete resolution of all systemic entanglements upon initial setup."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "options": ["Guaranteeing complete confidentiality to all family members involved.", "Prioritizing the facilitator's interpretation of the system over the client's experience.", "Ensuring the client has adequate resources and support systems in place before, during, and after the constellation.", "Encouraging the client to confront all family members immediately after the constellation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client safety and well-being are paramount. Ensuring adequate support systems are in place is crucial, especially when dealing with sensitive material. Case studies highlight the importance of pre- and post-constellation support."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the grandmother's suffering, expressing gratitude, and symbolically returning the burden is an appropriate intervention to disentangle Sarah from her grandmother's trauma. This honors the past while allowing Sarah to move forward."
