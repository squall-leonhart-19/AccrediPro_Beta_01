            "options": ["A group of individuals with similar DNA.", "A collection of people related by blood or marriage, interconnected through shared experiences and a collective unconscious.", "Any organization with a defined hierarchy.", "A set of legal documents outlining familial relationships."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Family Constellations views the family as a system where members are interconnected and influence each other, often unconsciously."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "What is a 'hidden loyalty' within a family system?",
            "options": ["An overt expression of affection for a specific family member.", "An unconscious commitment to repeat patterns or fulfill unmet needs of ancestors, even at personal cost.", "A secret financial agreement between family members.", "A conscious decision to prioritize one family member's needs over others."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hidden loyalties are unconscious commitments that drive individuals to act in ways that honor the system's past, often repeating patterns or sacrificing personal well-being."
        },

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "According to Bert Hellinger's 'Orders of Love', what is the primary principle related to belonging?",
            "options": ["Only those who contribute financially to the family business have a right to belong.", "Every member of the system has an equal right to belong, regardless of their actions or circumstances.", "Belonging is earned through good behavior and adherence to family traditions.", "Those who leave the family system forfeit their right to belong."],

            "explanation": "The 'Orders of Love' emphasize that every member, past or present, has an inherent right to belong to the family system."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "How might a family secret manifest systemically?",
            "options": ["By strengthening family bonds through shared confidentiality.", "By creating a void or imbalance in the system, leading to symptoms in later generations as the system attempts to compensate.", "By having no impact on the family system if kept completely hidden.", "By allowing the family to rewrite its history in a more favorable light."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secrets create systemic imbalances. Information wants to be known and will often manifest as symptoms in later generations."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently sabotages her romantic relationships around the same anniversary date each year. What transgenerational pattern might be at play?",
            "options": ["Sarah is simply unlucky in love.", "Sarah may be unconsciously repeating a pattern of loss or relationship failure experienced by an ancestor around that date.", "Sarah has a fear of commitment.", "Sarah's friends are giving her bad relationship advice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Transgenerational patterns involve the unconscious repetition of past events or traumas across generations. Sarah's behavior suggests a possible link to an ancestor's experience."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systemic blind spots are areas of the family history or dynamics that are unconsciously avoided, preventing healing and resolution."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Honoring the fate means accepting the past as it was, acknowledging the ancestor's full experience, and allowing the present generation to move forward without being burdened by unresolved issues."

            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a typical indicator of systemic entanglement?",
            "options": ["Feeling responsible for the well-being of other family members to an excessive degree.", "Experiencing recurring negative emotions or behaviors that seem disproportionate to current circumstances.", "Having a strong sense of personal identity and clear boundaries.", "Difficulty making independent decisions without feeling guilty or disloyal."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systemic entanglement often involves blurred boundaries, excessive responsibility for others, and difficulty separating one's own needs and feelings from those of the family system. A strong sense of personal identity is a sign of differentiation, not entanglement."
