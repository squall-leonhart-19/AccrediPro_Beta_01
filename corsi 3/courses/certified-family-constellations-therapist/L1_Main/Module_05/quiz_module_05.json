            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old woman, Sarah, consistently sabotages her romantic relationships. A Family Constellation reveals a deep-seated loyalty to her divorced mother, who harbors resentment towards men. Which healing sentence might be MOST appropriate to facilitate resolution?",
