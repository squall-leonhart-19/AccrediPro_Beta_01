            "options": ["Assigning blame to the original perpetrator.", "Understanding the systemic function the trauma served.", "Erasing the memory of the trauma from the family system.", "Re-traumatizing the client to promote catharsis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced Source Identification focuses on understanding the systemic role the trauma played, recognizing its impact on subsequent generations and family dynamics, not assigning blame or erasing memories."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transgenerational trauma frequently manifests as unexplained emotional or physical symptoms in individuals who did not directly experience the initial trauma, stemming from unresolved emotional wounds passed down through generations. A study by Yehuda et al. (2016) demonstrated epigenetic changes in offspring of trauma survivors."

            "correctAnswer": 0,

Guaranteeing specific outcomes is unethical as it is impossible to predict or control the results of therapeutic interventions."
