        {
            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST fundamental ethical principle guiding Family Constellations work?",
            "options": ["Minimizing client discomfort", "Respect for the systemic forces at play", "Adherence to a specific constellation format", "Guaranteeing positive outcomes for clients"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Respect for the systemic forces is paramount. While minimizing discomfort and aiming for positive outcomes are important, they are secondary to honoring the systemic dynamics revealed in the constellation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A Family Constellations therapist is approached by a potential client who is also a close personal friend. What is the MOST appropriate course of action regarding dual relationships?",
            "options": ["Proceed with therapy, as the friendship provides a strong foundation.", "Disclose the friendship and proceed with therapy if the client consents.", "Refer the client to another qualified therapist to avoid potential conflicts of interest.", "Minimize contact outside of therapy sessions to maintain professional boundaries."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Referring the client is the most ethical choice. Dual relationships, especially with close friends, create a significant risk of compromised objectivity and potential harm to the therapeutic relationship, even with disclosure."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "According to the guidelines discussed, what is the primary ethical consideration when handling client data and confidentiality in Family Constellations work?",
            "options": ["Storing data indefinitely to track long-term outcomes.", "Obtaining informed consent for data collection and usage.", "Sharing client information with colleagues for consultation without consent.", "Using client data for marketing purposes without explicit permission."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is paramount. Clients must understand how their data will be used, stored, and protected. All other options violate ethical principles of confidentiality and autonomy. A 2018 study in the 'Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics' emphasized the importance of clear and comprehensive informed consent procedures."

        {
            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "A client undergoing a Family Constellations session begins to exhibit signs of severe emotional distress and trauma. What is the MOST appropriate immediate response from the therapist?",
            "options": ["Encourage the client to push through the discomfort to achieve a breakthrough.", "Immediately halt the constellation and provide support and resources for trauma processing.", "Continue the constellation but avoid addressing the traumatic material directly.", "Document the client's reaction and proceed with the session as planned."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist's priority is to ensure the client's safety and well-being. Halting the session and providing support is crucial when trauma is triggered. Pushing the client can be retraumatizing, as noted in 'Trauma-Sensitive Mindfulness' by Treleaven (2018)."

        {
            "id": "q22_5",
            "question": "Which statement BEST describes the ethical considerations surrounding power dynamics in the Family Constellations therapeutic relationship?",
            "options": ["The therapist's role is inherently equal to the client's, eliminating power imbalances.", "Therapists should be aware of the inherent power differential and actively work to minimize its impact.", "Clients should defer to the therapist's expertise in all matters related to the constellation process.", "Power dynamics are irrelevant as long as the therapist is well-intentioned."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Therapists hold a position of authority, and it's their ethical responsibility to be mindful of this power dynamic and mitigate its potential negative effects on client autonomy and agency. As highlighted in 'Ethical Practice in Psychology' (Sinclair, 2016), awareness and mitigation are key."

            "id": "q22_6",
            "question": "A Family Constellations therapist's website claims a '100% success rate' in resolving family issues. What ethical principle is MOST directly violated by this statement?",
            "options": ["Beneficence", "Justice", "Non-maleficence", "Veracity (Honesty)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The claim of a '100% success rate' is a clear violation of veracity. It's dishonest and misleading, as therapeutic outcomes are rarely guaranteed and depend on numerous factors. Such claims can exploit vulnerable individuals seeking help."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_7",
            "question": "Which of the following steps is MOST crucial in ethical decision-making when faced with a complex dilemma in Family Constellations work?",
            "options": ["Following your gut feeling about what is right.", "Consulting with experienced colleagues and supervisors.", "Prioritizing the therapist's personal values above all else.", "Ignoring the dilemma and hoping it resolves itself."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consultation with colleagues and supervisors is a cornerstone of ethical practice. It provides different perspectives, helps identify potential biases, and ensures decisions are well-reasoned and aligned with ethical guidelines. The ACA's Code of Ethics emphasizes the importance of consultation."

        {
            "id": "q22_8",
            "question": "According to a 2022 report by the Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice (AFT), what is the MOST common legal issue faced by Family Constellations therapists?",
            "options": ["Copyright infringement", "Breach of contract", "Scope of practice violations", "Tax evasion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Scope of practice violations are a frequent legal concern. Therapists must adhere to the regulations governing their professional licenses and avoid practicing outside their areas of competence. The 2022 AFT report specifically addressed this issue."

        {
            "id": "q22_9",
            "question": "A client reveals during a Family Constellations session that they are experiencing suicidal ideation. What is the therapist's ethical and legal obligation?",
            "options": ["Maintain confidentiality at all costs.", "Encourage the client to meditate and find inner peace.", "Assess the risk of suicide and take appropriate action, including breaking confidentiality if necessary.", "Refer the client to a self-help book on overcoming depression."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The therapist has a duty to protect the client and others from harm. Assessing the risk of suicide and taking appropriate action, which may include breaking confidentiality to ensure the client's safety, is paramount. This aligns with legal and ethical standards across most jurisdictions."

        {
            "id": "q22_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A Family Constellations therapist, Sarah, noticed that she consistently felt triggered and overwhelmed when working with clients who had experienced childhood neglect, a trauma she herself had experienced. What is the MOST ethical course of action for Sarah?",
            "options": ["Continue working with these clients, as her personal experience gives her unique insight.", "Avoid working with clients who have experienced childhood neglect.", "Seek personal therapy and/or supervision to address her own trauma and its impact on her work.", "Disclose her personal history to clients and allow them to decide if they want to continue working with her."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Seeking personal therapy and/or supervision is the most ethical choice. Sarah needs to address her own unresolved trauma to prevent it from negatively impacting her clients. While disclosure might seem transparent, it could burden clients or create inappropriate boundaries. Avoiding these clients altogether could limit access to care. Supervision and therapy are the best option."
