            "question": "Which of the following is a primary challenge in conducting rigorous research on Family Constellations?",
            "options": ["The method is easily standardized for large-scale studies.", "Participant experiences are inherently subjective and difficult to quantify.", "Funding for Family Constellations research is readily available.", "There is an abundance of randomized controlled trials already available."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The subjective nature of participant experiences and the difficulty in quantifying the effects of Family Constellations pose a significant challenge to rigorous research."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "A researcher aims to investigate the impact of Family Constellations on trauma symptoms. Which research design would be MOST appropriate for demonstrating causality?",
            "options": ["Case study", "Correlational study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Qualitative interview study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is the gold standard for demonstrating causality as it involves random assignment to treatment and control groups, minimizing bias."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Maria,' a 45-year-old experiencing persistent anxiety, Family Constellations was used. If the researcher wants to analyze this case study through a research lens, what is the FIRST step they should take?",
            "options": ["Immediately implement the intervention.", "Formulate specific research questions about the intervention's effect on anxiety.", "Disregard ethical considerations because it's a case study.", "Assume the intervention will be effective based on anecdotal evidence."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Formulating specific research questions is the first step in analyzing a case study through a research lens, guiding the investigation and ensuring focus."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "What is a critical consideration when evaluating the methodological soundness of a study on Family Constellations?",
            "options": ["The researcher's personal belief in Family Constellations.", "The use of subjective outcome measures.", "The presence of a control group and blinding procedures.", "The length of the introduction section."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The presence of a control group and blinding procedures are crucial for minimizing bias and ensuring the methodological soundness of a study."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "You are reviewing a study that claims Family Constellations significantly reduces depression symptoms. The p-value is reported as 0.06. How should you interpret this finding?",
            "options": ["The results are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.", "The results are not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.", "The study proves that Family Constellations cures depression.", "The p-value is irrelevant to the study's conclusions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is above the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance, meaning the results are not considered statistically significant."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice emphasizes the integration of research findings, clinical expertise, and client values, rather than relying solely on personal intuition."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the purpose of a 'mixed-methods' research design in the context of Family Constellations?",
            "options": ["To only use quantitative data.", "To combine qualitative and quantitative data to provide a more comprehensive understanding.", "To only use qualitative data.", "To avoid using any statistical analysis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A mixed-methods design combines qualitative and quantitative data to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the research topic."
