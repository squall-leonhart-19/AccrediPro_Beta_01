            "question": "What is the primary purpose of establishing clear treatment goals and objectives in Family Constellations therapy?",
            "options": ["To satisfy insurance requirements.", "To provide a framework for measuring progress and ensuring the client's needs are met.", "To limit the scope of the therapeutic process.", "To impress other therapists."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clear goals and objectives provide a roadmap for therapy, allowing both therapist and client to track progress and ensure the intervention remains aligned with the client's needs and desired outcomes. As discussed in L1, this focused approach enhances the effectiveness of the therapeutic process."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "In the S.Y.S.T.E.M. Framework™, what does the 'Y' represent?",
            "options": ["Yielding to the client's desires", "Your unique therapeutic style", "Yielding to the systemic influences", "Yearly review of treatment plan"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Y' in the S.Y.S.T.E.M. Framework™ represents 'Yielding to the systemic influences.' This emphasizes the importance of considering the broader family system and its impact on the individual, as highlighted in L2."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "A client presents with a history of severe childhood trauma. According to trauma-informed principles, what is the FIRST priority in treatment planning?",
            "options": ["Exploring the family dynamics immediately.", "Establishing safety and stabilization.", "Challenging their negative beliefs.", "Focusing on their career goals."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As emphasized in L5, establishing safety and stabilization is paramount when working with clients who have a history of trauma. This creates a secure base from which to explore deeper issues."

        {
            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key indicator of client readiness for Family Constellations therapy?",
            "options": ["A willingness to explore family history.", "A high level of emotional regulation.", "A complete absence of resistance.", "An ability to articulate their needs and goals."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "As discussed in L3, some resistance is normal. Expecting a complete absence of resistance is unrealistic and may indicate a lack of self-awareness or unrealistic expectations from the client. Readiness includes willingness to explore and articulate needs, but not necessarily a complete lack of resistance."

            "options": ["Ignoring the resistance and continuing with the planned intervention.", "Directly confronting the client about their resistance.", "Exploring the underlying reasons for the resistance with empathy and curiosity.", "Terminating the session immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "L6 emphasizes that resistance should be approached with empathy and curiosity. Exploring the underlying reasons for resistance can provide valuable insights into the client's fears and beliefs, ultimately facilitating deeper healing."

            "question": "A therapist is working with a client, Sarah (age 35), who presents with anxiety and difficulty in romantic relationships. Early sessions reveal a pattern of enmeshment with her mother. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate initial treatment goal?",
            "options": ["To completely detach from her mother.", "To understand and begin to establish healthier boundaries with her mother.", "To blame her mother for her relationship problems.", "To find a new romantic partner immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Based on case studies discussed, a realistic and therapeutic initial goal is to help Sarah understand the pattern of enmeshment and begin to establish healthier boundaries. Complete detachment is often unrealistic and potentially harmful. Blaming is not therapeutic, and finding a new partner is not the immediate focus.",
            "caseStudy": "Sarah, 35, anxiety and relationship issues"
        },
        {

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A measurable objective involves specific, observable behaviors or outcomes. 'To identify and express three specific memories of the deceased that bring comfort within two weeks' provides a clear and achievable target. Other options are too vague or unrealistic."

            "options": ["Dual relationships are always acceptable as long as the client consents.", "Dual relationships should be avoided whenever possible to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain professional boundaries.", "Dual relationships are encouraged to build rapport.", "Dual relationships are only acceptable if the client is a family member."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L8 emphasizes the importance of avoiding dual relationships to maintain objectivity, prevent exploitation, and ensure the client's well-being. Dual relationships can compromise the therapeutic process and create ethical dilemmas."

            "options": ["Terminate therapy immediately due to lack of engagement.", "Explore the client's ambivalence and address their concerns about the therapeutic process.", "Ignore the behavior and focus on the planned interventions.", "Increase the session fee to motivate the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L6 highlights the importance of addressing client ambivalence and skepticism directly. Exploring their concerns can help identify underlying fears or beliefs that are hindering their progress. Open communication is crucial for building trust and fostering a collaborative therapeutic relationship."
