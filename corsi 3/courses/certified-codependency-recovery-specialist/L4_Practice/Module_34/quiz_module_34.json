            "options": ["Focusing primarily on individual success stories.", "Establishing clear group norms and boundaries.", "Allowing members to freely interrupt and challenge each other.", "Discouraging the sharing of personal vulnerabilities."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Beliefs; by encouraging members to share their religious perspectives.", "Boundaries; by defining acceptable behaviors and limits within the group.", "Blame; by identifying the root causes of codependent behaviors.", "Bargaining; by negotiating individual needs within the group setting."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the BOUND Framework™, 'B' stands for Boundaries. Clear boundaries, as emphasized by Brown & Miller (2015), are crucial for fostering a sense of safety and respect, leading to increased group cohesion and trust."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, age 45, consistently interrupts others in the group, diverting the focus to her own issues. Which facilitation technique would be MOST effective in addressing this behavior?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior to avoid confrontation.", "Privately addressing Sarah's behavior outside of the group session.", "Publicly reprimanding Sarah to set an example for others.", "Encouraging other group members to confront Sarah directly."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the behavior privately allows for a constructive conversation without shaming or alienating the client. This approach aligns with ethical guidelines for group facilitation, as outlined by Corey, Corey, & Corey (2019)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining confidentiality and data security is paramount when using technology in group settings. HIPAA regulations and ethical guidelines emphasize the importance of protecting client information, especially in online environments (NASW, 2021)."

            "id": "q34_5",

            "options": ["The number of participants who attend the workshop.", "Changes in participants' scores on a standardized codependency assessment tool.", "The facilitator's personal satisfaction with the workshop.", "The number of social media posts about the workshop."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using a standardized assessment tool, such as the Codependency Assessment Tool (CAT), allows for objective measurement of changes in codependent behaviors and attitudes following the workshop. This aligns with best practices in program evaluation (Rossi et al., 2019)."

        {
            "id": "q34_6",

            "options": ["Ignoring the substance use issues to focus solely on codependency.", "Referring members to a separate substance abuse support group.", "Integrating principles of addiction recovery into the group sessions.", "Encouraging members to self-medicate to cope with codependency symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating principles of addiction recovery, such as motivational interviewing and relapse prevention strategies, is crucial when addressing co-occurring conditions. This integrated approach, supported by research from Miller & Rollnick (2012), ensures that both issues are addressed effectively."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on adult learning principles and research on workshop effectiveness, a 6-hour workshop allows for sufficient time to cover key concepts, engage in activities, and facilitate meaningful discussions without overwhelming participants. Studies have shown that workshops longer than 8 hours can lead to decreased engagement and retention (Knowles et al., 2020)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing skepticism with evidence-based information and empathy can help build trust and encourage the participant to remain open to the process. This approach aligns with principles of motivational interviewing (Miller & Rollnick, 2012)."
