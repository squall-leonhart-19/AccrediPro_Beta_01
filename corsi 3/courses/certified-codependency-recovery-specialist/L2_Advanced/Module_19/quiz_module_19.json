        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "According to research presented in the module, which attachment style is most frequently associated with codependency?",
            "options": ["Secure Attachment", "Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment", "Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment", "Fearful-Avoidant Attachment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment, characterized by a high need for validation and fear of abandonment, has the strongest empirical links to codependency."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "What percentage of individuals with a history of childhood trauma are estimated to exhibit codependent traits, based on the studies reviewed?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that 50-60% of individuals with childhood trauma histories exhibit codependent traits, highlighting a significant correlation."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a validated instrument commonly used to assess codependency?",
            "options": ["Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)", "Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS)", "Codependency Assessment Tool (COAT)", "State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Codependency Assessment Tool (COAT) is a validated instrument specifically designed to measure codependency traits and behaviors."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which evidence-based intervention has demonstrated the LEAST effectiveness in treating codependency?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)", "Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)", "Psychodynamic Therapy", "Brief Solution-Focused Therapy (BSFT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While CBT, DBT, and psychodynamic therapy have shown promise, Brief Solution-Focused Therapy (BSFT) has comparatively less empirical support for codependency treatment specifically."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Within the BOUND Framework™, what does the 'B' represent?",
            "options": ["Boundaries", "Beliefs", "Behavior", "Balance"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the BOUND Framework™, 'B' stands for Boundaries, which are crucial for healthy relationships and overcoming codependency."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, 35, presents with anxiety and difficulty making decisions independently. She constantly seeks approval from her partner. According to attachment theory, which intervention would be MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Exposure therapy for anxiety", "Cognitive restructuring to challenge negative thoughts", "Exploring past relationship patterns and attachment experiences", "Prescribing an SSRI for anxiety"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's presentation, exploring past relationship patterns and attachment experiences is the most appropriate initial intervention, as it addresses the root of her codependent tendencies."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is the primary pharmacological consideration when treating codependency?",
            "options": ["Directly targeting codependent traits with medication", "Treating co-occurring disorders like depression and anxiety", "Using medication to enhance boundary setting", "Replacing therapy with medication"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Pharmacological interventions in codependency treatment primarily focus on managing co-occurring disorders such as depression and anxiety, rather than directly targeting codependent traits."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A meta-analysis cited in the module indicated what approximate effect size for CBT interventions in reducing codependent behaviors?",
            "options": ["Small effect (d=0.2)", "Medium effect (d=0.5)", "Large effect (d=0.8)", "Negligible effect (d=0.05)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis showed a medium effect size (d=0.5) for CBT interventions in reducing codependent behaviors, suggesting a moderate level of effectiveness."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Which research area is identified as a promising future direction in codependency research?",
            "options": ["Developing new pharmacological treatments", "Investigating the neurobiological correlates of codependency", "Creating shorter assessment tools", "Focusing solely on individual therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Investigating the neurobiological correlates of codependency is a promising future direction, as it could provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms and inform more targeted interventions."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "According to the module, what is a key limitation in current codependency research?",
            "options": ["Over-reliance on qualitative data", "Lack of standardized assessment measures", "Too many longitudinal studies", "Exclusion of diverse populations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A key limitation in current codependency research is the lack of standardized assessment measures, which makes it difficult to compare findings across studies and develop evidence-based treatments."
