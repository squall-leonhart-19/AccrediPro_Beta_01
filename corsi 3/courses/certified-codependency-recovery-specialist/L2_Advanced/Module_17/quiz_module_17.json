            "question": "A client with codependency also presents with symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in treatment planning?",
            "options": ["Addressing the codependency patterns first, as they are often the root cause.", "Prioritizing BPD symptoms to reduce immediate crisis risk and emotional dysregulation.", "Simultaneously addressing both codependency and BPD using integrated treatment approaches.", "Focusing on medication management to stabilize mood before addressing any relational patterns."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing BPD symptoms is crucial due to the potential for crisis and emotional dysregulation. Stabilizing these symptoms creates a foundation for addressing codependency patterns effectively. Research suggests that individuals with co-occurring BPD and codependency benefit from a phased approach."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which statement BEST reflects the impact of high-conflict relationships on individuals with codependency?",
            "options": ["High-conflict relationships always exacerbate codependent behaviors, regardless of individual resilience.", "Individuals with codependency are naturally drawn to high-conflict relationships, seeking validation through caretaking.", "High-conflict relationships can reinforce codependent patterns by creating a cycle of anxiety, caretaking, and resentment.", "Individuals with codependency are immune to the negative effects of high-conflict relationships due to their strong sense of self-sacrifice."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "High-conflict relationships often fuel codependent patterns by creating a cycle where the individual attempts to soothe conflict through caretaking, which then leads to resentment and further conflict. This cycle reinforces the codependent's need to control and fix the situation."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of individuals with a history of childhood trauma also exhibit codependent traits?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 75% of individuals with a history of childhood trauma demonstrate codependent traits. This highlights the strong link between trauma and the development of codependent behaviors as coping mechanisms."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A therapist is working with a client from a collectivist culture who is exhibiting codependent behaviors within their family. What is the MOST important consideration for the therapist?",
            "options": ["Immediately challenging the client's cultural values to promote individual autonomy.", "Ignoring the cultural context and focusing solely on individual codependent behaviors.", "Understanding and respecting the client's cultural values while exploring the potential negative impacts of codependency within that context.", "Encouraging the client to completely separate from their family to break the cycle of codependency."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "It's vital to consider cultural values. In collectivist cultures, interdependence is valued, but it's essential to explore whether codependent behaviors are causing harm within that cultural framework. A culturally sensitive approach respects the client's background while addressing problematic behaviors."

            "options": ["The client's immediate willingness to leave the relationship.", "The client's difficulty recognizing the narcissistic partner's behaviors as abusive.", "The client's overestimation of their own role in the relationship dynamics.", "The client's ability to easily establish healthy boundaries with the partner."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients with narcissistic partners often struggle to recognize the abusive nature of the relationship due to manipulation, gaslighting, and a tendency to blame themselves. This lack of awareness is a significant barrier to change."

            "question": "A therapist becomes aware that a client is using codependent behaviors to maintain a relationship with a family member who is actively engaged in criminal activity. What is the therapist's ethical responsibility?",
            "options": ["To immediately report the family member's criminal activity to the authorities, regardless of client confidentiality.", "To prioritize client confidentiality above all else, even if it means enabling criminal activity.", "To balance the duty to protect the client and others with the need to maintain client confidentiality, potentially involving consultation with a legal or ethical expert.", "To encourage the client to directly confront the family member about their criminal activity."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "This scenario presents a complex ethical dilemma. Therapists must balance their duty to protect the client and others with the need to maintain confidentiality. Consultation with legal or ethical experts is recommended to navigate this situation responsibly."

            "options": ["Thought suppression to eliminate negative emotions.", "Cognitive restructuring to challenge irrational beliefs.", "Mindful self-compassion practices to cultivate kindness and acceptance towards oneself.", "Engaging in distractions to avoid experiencing uncomfortable feelings."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindful self-compassion involves treating oneself with the same kindness and understanding one would offer a friend. This approach can help clients reduce feelings of guilt and shame associated with setting boundaries and prioritize their own needs."

            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "What is a key difference between healthy interdependence and codependency?",
            "options": ["Healthy interdependence involves a complete lack of boundaries, while codependency involves rigid boundaries.", "Healthy interdependence involves mutual support and respect, while codependency involves excessive caretaking and a loss of personal identity.", "Healthy interdependence focuses solely on individual needs, while codependency prioritizes the needs of others.", "There is no significant difference between healthy interdependence and codependency."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Healthy interdependence is characterized by mutual support, respect, and healthy boundaries. Codependency, on the other hand, involves excessive caretaking, a blurring of boundaries, and a loss of personal identity as the individual becomes overly focused on the needs of others."
