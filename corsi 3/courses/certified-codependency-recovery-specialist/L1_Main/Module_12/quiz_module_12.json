            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key component of advanced trauma-informed care for codependency, going beyond basic awareness?",
            "options": ["Simply acknowledging the client's past trauma.", "Developing a deep understanding of the neurobiological impacts of trauma and its connection to codependent behaviors.", "Avoiding direct discussion of traumatic events to prevent re-traumatization.", "Focusing solely on present-day relationship patterns."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced trauma-informed care requires understanding the neurobiological impacts of trauma. As discussed, this includes how trauma affects brain structures and stress response systems, contributing to codependent behaviors.  Simply acknowledging trauma is insufficient."

        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "According to Attachment Theory, individuals with a preoccupied attachment style are MOST likely to exhibit which behavior in relationships?",
            "options": ["High levels of independence and emotional distance.", "A strong desire for intimacy and a fear of abandonment.", "Comfort with solitude and a disinterest in close relationships.", "Consistent displays of secure and stable emotional responses."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Preoccupied attachment is characterized by a strong desire for closeness and a fear of abandonment. This often manifests as clinginess, neediness, and difficulty trusting others, all of which contribute to codependent patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "The 'inner critic' is often a manifestation of which core wound in codependency?",
            "options": ["Lack of assertiveness.", "Fear of abandonment.", "Unresolved shame.", "Difficulty setting boundaries."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The inner critic stems from deeply ingrained shame. This internalized voice constantly judges and criticizes, reinforcing feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy, and fueling codependent behaviors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which of the following represents an advanced boundary-setting technique in complex relationship dynamics?",
            "options": ["Giving in to others' demands to avoid conflict.", "Clearly communicating one's needs and limits, while also validating the other person's feelings, even if disagreement persists.", "Building walls to isolate oneself from potential hurt.", "Ignoring one's own needs to prioritize the needs of others."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced boundary setting involves assertive communication and validation.  It acknowledges both one's own needs and the other person's perspective, even when boundaries are challenged.  It's about connection, not isolation."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "A client with codependency is also struggling with alcohol addiction. Which of the following approaches is MOST crucial in their treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Addressing the addiction first, and then focusing on codependency.", "Treating both codependency and addiction concurrently, recognizing their interwoven nature.", "Ignoring the codependency until the addiction is fully managed.", "Focusing solely on the addiction, as it is the more immediate threat."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Codependency and addiction are often intertwined, with one fueling the other.  Concurrent treatment is essential to address the underlying emotional and behavioral patterns that contribute to both issues. As the lesson highlighted, recovery is more effective when addressing both issues simultaneously."

        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "What makes self-care a 'radical act' in the context of codependency recovery?",
            "options": ["It is a selfish indulgence that reinforces unhealthy patterns.", "It challenges the codependent's ingrained belief that their worth is tied to serving others.", "It is a quick fix for underlying emotional issues.", "It is a way to avoid dealing with difficult relationships."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-care is radical because it directly confronts the core codependent belief that one's value lies in self-sacrifice. Prioritizing one's own needs challenges this deeply ingrained pattern and promotes self-compassion and healthy boundaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the concept of interdependence in healthy relationships?",
            "options": ["Complete reliance on one another for emotional support.", "Maintaining clear boundaries while mutually supporting each other's growth and autonomy.", "Avoiding any form of dependence on others.", "Prioritizing one person's needs over the other's."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interdependence involves a balance of connection and autonomy. Individuals in interdependent relationships support each other while maintaining their own identities and boundaries. It's about choice, not necessity."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "A client in long-term codependency recovery experiences a sudden urge to revert to old caretaking behaviors. Which relapse prevention strategy would be MOST effective in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the urge and hoping it will pass.", "Immediately engaging in the caretaking behavior to alleviate the discomfort.", "Identifying the trigger for the urge, practicing self-compassion, and activating a pre-determined coping strategy.", "Isolating oneself from others to avoid potential triggers."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Effective relapse prevention involves recognizing triggers, practicing self-compassion, and implementing pre-planned coping mechanisms. Ignoring the urge or reverting to old behaviors reinforces the codependent pattern.  As discussed, a relapse prevention plan should be proactive, not reactive."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "A therapist is working with a client who consistently minimizes their own needs and prioritizes their partner's. Which question would be MOST helpful in exploring the underlying shame driving this behavior?",
            "options": ["'Why do you think your partner needs so much help?'", "'What would happen if you prioritized your own needs for a change?'", "'What messages did you receive in childhood about your worth and value?'", "'Do you think your partner is taking advantage of you?'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring childhood messages about worth and value can uncover the roots of shame that drive codependent behaviors. These messages often shape an individual's belief that they are only worthy of love and acceptance when they are meeting the needs of others. The other options are less directly focused on uncovering the root of the behavior."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate a high prevalence of codependency among individuals with substance use disorders. Approximately 60-80% of individuals struggling with addiction also display codependent traits, highlighting the importance of addressing both issues in treatment."
