            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial initial step when conducting an advanced assessment for codependency, particularly when considering differential diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Administering a standardized codependency assessment tool.", "Gathering a detailed family history, including intergenerational patterns.", "Immediately exploring the client's current relationship dynamics.", "Focusing solely on the client's presenting symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gathering a detailed family history, including intergenerational patterns, is crucial for understanding the roots of codependency and differentiating it from other conditions. According to Bowen Family Systems Theory, intergenerational patterns significantly influence individual behavior."

            "id": "q24_2",
            "question": "According to the B.O.U.N.D. Framework™, which element focuses on identifying and addressing the client's core beliefs that perpetuate codependent behaviors?",
            "options": ["Boundaries", "Opportunities", "Understanding", "Needs", "Desires"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Understanding' component of the B.O.U.N.D. Framework™ specifically targets the identification and modification of core beliefs that drive codependent patterns. This aligns with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles."

            "id": "q24_3",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently overextends herself to meet the needs of her family, neglecting her own well-being. She reports feeling resentful but unable to stop. Which advanced boundary setting technique would be MOST effective in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Implementing 'all-or-nothing' boundaries to prevent any overextension.", "Using assertive communication to clearly define her limits and needs.", "Completely withdrawing from family interactions to establish independence.", "Ignoring her feelings of resentment and continuing her current behavior."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assertive communication, including 'I' statements and clear articulation of needs, is crucial for setting healthy boundaries. Studies show that assertive communication reduces feelings of resentment and improves relationship satisfaction."

            "question": "In trauma-informed codependency treatment, what is the primary goal when addressing past trauma?",
            "options": ["Suppressing traumatic memories to minimize distress.", "Helping the client re-experience the trauma in a safe and controlled environment.", "Establishing safety and stabilization before processing traumatic memories.", "Encouraging the client to immediately confront their abusers."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and stabilization is paramount in trauma-informed care. According to Judith Herman's 'Trauma and Recovery,' safety must be established before trauma processing to prevent re-traumatization."

            "id": "q24_5",
            "question": "When working with complex family systems exhibiting enmeshment, which intervention is MOST likely to promote differentiation of self?",
            "options": ["Encouraging family members to spend more time together to strengthen bonds.", "Facilitating individual therapy sessions to explore personal identities and needs.", "Implementing strict rules to control family interactions.", "Focusing solely on the identified patient's symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individual therapy promotes differentiation of self by allowing individuals to explore their own identities, needs, and values separate from the family system. This aligns with Bowen Family Systems Theory's emphasis on differentiation."

        {
            "id": "q24_6",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Providing therapy to a close personal friend creates a dual relationship, compromising objectivity and potentially exploiting the client. Ethical guidelines strictly prohibit dual relationships."

            "question": "A client in long-term codependency recovery reports increased anxiety and a return to old patterns of people-pleasing. Which relapse prevention strategy would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Advising the client to avoid all social interactions to minimize triggers.", "Reviewing coping skills and identifying potential triggers.", "Increasing the frequency of therapy sessions indefinitely.", "Ignoring the client's concerns and assuming it's a temporary setback."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reviewing coping skills and identifying potential triggers is a proactive relapse prevention strategy. This helps the client recognize early warning signs and implement effective coping mechanisms."

            "id": "q24_8",
            "question": "In advanced group facilitation for codependency recovery, what is the primary purpose of using process-oriented interventions?",
            "options": ["To solely focus on individual member's specific issues.", "To create a structured and predictable group environment.", "To explore the dynamics and relationships within the group itself.", "To avoid conflict and maintain a harmonious atmosphere."],
