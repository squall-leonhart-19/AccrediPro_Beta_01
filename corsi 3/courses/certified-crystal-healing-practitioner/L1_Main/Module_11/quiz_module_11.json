            "question": "When constructing an advanced crystal grid for space clearing, which of the following crystals is MOST effective at transmuting negative energies?",
            "options": ["Rose Quartz", "Amethyst", "Clear Quartz", "Black Tourmaline"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Black Tourmaline is renowned for its ability to absorb and transmute negative energies, making it a powerful choice for space clearing grids. Studies have shown its effectiveness in mitigating electromagnetic fields."

            "question": "Which of the following methods is considered the SAFEST for preparing a crystal elixir for internal use?",
            "options": ["Direct immersion method", "Indirect method", "Boiling the crystals", "Using crystals containing toxic elements"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The indirect method, where the crystal is placed in a separate container within the water, prevents direct contact and potential contamination, making it the safest option for internal elixirs. Direct immersion can leach harmful substances."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "In advanced dowsing for crystal selection, what is the significance of the 'swing angle' when using a pendulum over a crystal?",
            "options": ["Indicates the crystal's color", "Represents the crystal's energetic vibration", "Shows the crystal's market value", "Determines the crystal's geographical origin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The swing angle, along with the direction and speed of the pendulum's movement, provides information about the crystal's energetic vibration and its compatibility with the user's intentions. A wider angle often indicates a stronger vibration."

            "question": "A client discloses they are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. What is the MOST ETHICAL and appropriate course of action for a crystal healing practitioner?",
            "options": ["Recommend crystals as a replacement for chemotherapy", "Offer crystal healing as a complementary therapy alongside medical treatment", "Guarantee a cure using specific crystals", "Discourage the client from seeking medical advice"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Crystal healing should always be presented as a complementary therapy, never as a replacement for conventional medical treatment. It's unethical and potentially harmful to suggest otherwise. The practitioner's scope of practice does not include medical diagnosis or treatment."
