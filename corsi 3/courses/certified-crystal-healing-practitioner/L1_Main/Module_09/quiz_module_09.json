            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary benefit of using advanced crystal grids?",
            "options": ["Enhanced energy amplification", "Focused intention manifestation", "Simplified crystal selection", "Harmonization of environmental energies"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advanced crystal grids enhance complexity and customization, not necessarily simplification of crystal selection. They are used for energy amplification, intention focusing, and environmental harmonization."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A client is seeking clarity on a career decision. Using pendulum dowsing, which question phrasing is MOST likely to yield an accurate 'yes' or 'no' response?",
            "options": ["Should I take the new job?", "Is the new job in alignment with my highest good?", "Tell me about the new job.", "What are the benefits of the new job?"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Questions phrased to align with the client's highest good tend to resonate most accurately in pendulum dowsing. Open-ended questions are less suitable for this technique."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on deepening intuitive abilities, which practice is MOST effective for enhancing clairsentience?",
            "options": ["Visualizing energy fields", "Meditating with clear quartz", "Practicing mindful touch and texture awareness", "Repeating affirmations"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clairsentience is the ability to perceive information through feeling. Mindful touch exercises heighten sensitivity and awareness of subtle energies."

            "question": "In the A.L.I.G.N. Framework™, what does the 'G' represent?",
            "options": ["Grounding", "Guidance", "Gratitude", "Growth"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'G' in the A.L.I.G.N. Framework™ stands for Guidance, referring to seeking intuitive and higher-self guidance in the healing process."

            "question": "When preparing a crystal elixir using the indirect method, what is the MOST important safety precaution?",
            "options": ["Using only tumbled stones", "Ensuring the water is distilled", "Preventing direct contact between the crystal and water", "Charging the water under a full moon"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The indirect method is used for crystals that may be toxic or degrade in water. Preventing direct contact is crucial to avoid contamination."

            "question": "A client presents with chronic anxiety. Which crystal is MOST commonly recommended for its calming and grounding properties?",
            "options": ["Citrine", "Amethyst", "Clear Quartz", "Carnelian"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Amethyst is widely recognized for its calming and stress-reducing properties, making it suitable for clients with anxiety."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "Which sound healing instrument is LEAST likely to effectively integrate with crystal therapy to amplify healing vibrations?",
            "options": ["Tibetan Singing Bowls", "Crystal Singing Bowls", "Tuning Forks", "Electric Guitar"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While music can be therapeutic, the resonant frequencies of Tibetan Singing Bowls, Crystal Singing Bowls, and Tuning Forks are more directly aligned with the vibrational properties of crystals, making them more synergistic. An electric guitar's sound is less directly resonant."

        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "In building a successful crystal healing practice, what percentage of your marketing efforts should ideally focus on providing valuable content and building relationships, rather than direct sales pitches?",
            "options": ["20%", "50%", "80%", "95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The recommended ratio is often 80% valuable content and relationship-building, and 20% direct sales. This approach fosters trust and establishes you as an authority."

            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 35, experienced persistent insomnia. After a crystal healing session incorporating a grid with lepidolite, amethyst, and moonstone, Sarah reported significantly improved sleep quality for two weeks. What aspect of this case highlights the importance of ongoing assessment?",
            "options": ["Crystal choice", "Grid configuration", "Temporary effect", "Client's age"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case demonstrates the potential for crystal healing to improve sleep, but the temporary effect emphasizes the need for ongoing assessment and potentially adjusted interventions to maintain long-term benefits."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A 2023 study showed that crystal elixirs, prepared with rose quartz and consumed daily for one month, led to a <span class='stat-highlight'>30%</span> reduction in self-reported stress levels (n=60). Which ethical consideration is MOST relevant when presenting this information to potential clients?",
            "options": ["Guaranteeing similar results for all clients", "Clearly stating that results may vary and this is not a replacement for medical treatment", "Ignoring the study's limitations", "Promoting the elixir as a cure for stress"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It is crucial to be transparent about the potential variability in results and to emphasize that crystal healing is a complementary practice, not a replacement for conventional medical care. Avoid making guaranteed claims."
