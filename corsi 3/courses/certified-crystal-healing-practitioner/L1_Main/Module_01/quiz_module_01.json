            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY goal of energy assessment in crystal healing?",
            "options": ["To diagnose medical conditions.", "To determine the client's favorite crystal.", "To identify energetic imbalances and guide crystal selection.", "To predict the client's future."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to identify energetic imbalances that can be addressed with crystal healing, guiding the selection of appropriate crystals and techniques."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "When performing intuitive scanning, what might a sensation of 'heat' over a specific area of the body indicate?",
            "options": ["A blockage or excess of energy.", "A lack of energy or depletion.", "Perfect energetic balance.", "The presence of a specific crystal affinity."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In intuitive scanning, heat often indicates an excess or blockage of energy in that area. Conversely, coldness might suggest a deficiency."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A pendulum consistently swings in a clockwise direction over a chakra during assessment. What does this USUALLY indicate?",
            "options": ["The chakra is blocked.", "The chakra is overactive.", "The chakra is balanced and energy is flowing freely.", "The pendulum is faulty."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A clockwise swing typically indicates that the chakra is balanced and energy is flowing properly. Counter-clockwise or erratic movements may suggest imbalances."

            "question": "In muscle testing, a 'strong' response generally suggests:",
            "options": ["The statement being tested is false.", "The statement being tested is true and resonates with the body's energy.", "The client is dehydrated.", "The practitioner is applying too much pressure."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong muscle response typically indicates that the statement being tested is true or aligned with the body's energetic system. A weak response suggests the opposite."

            "question": "According to Lesson 5, what might a dominant 'blue' color in the aura MOST commonly represent?",
            "options": ["Passion and energy.", "Communication and intuition.", "Grounding and stability.", "Love and compassion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blue is often associated with communication, intuition, and a calm, peaceful nature. Remember that interpretations can vary based on shade and context."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue and low motivation. During chakra assessment, you find that their solar plexus chakra shows a weak or sluggish energy flow. Which of the following crystals might be MOST appropriate to consider?",
            "options": ["Amethyst.", "Citrine.", "Rose Quartz.", "Lapis Lazuli."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Citrine is often used to stimulate the solar plexus chakra, boosting energy, confidence, and motivation. Amethyst is for the crown chakra, Rose Quartz for the heart, and Lapis Lazuli for the third eye."

            "options": ["Rely solely on your strongest intuitive ability.", "Prioritize the technique that provides the fastest results.", "Corroborate findings across different methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding.", "Discard any conflicting information between techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The key is to use multiple techniques to confirm and deepen your understanding. Conflicting information should be investigated further, not ignored."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A client reports feeling anxious and disconnected. During assessment, you observe a fragmented aura with dark patches. Which of the following crystals might be MOST suitable to begin with?",
            "options": ["Black Tourmaline", "Clear Quartz", "Carnelian", "Aventurine"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Black Tourmaline is known for its grounding and protective properties, helping to clear negative energy and stabilize the aura."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 35, reports chronic headaches. Using a pendulum, you detect an imbalance in her third eye chakra. Muscle testing indicates a sensitivity to artificial light. Based on this, what INITIAL recommendation would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Suggest she immediately purchase a specific crystal.", "Advise her to consult a medical doctor for a diagnosis.", "Recommend reducing screen time and using blue light filters, alongside crystal healing for the third eye.", "Tell her that her headaches are purely energetic and unrelated to physical factors."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A holistic approach considers both energetic and lifestyle factors. Reducing screen time addresses the light sensitivity identified through muscle testing and crystal healing targets the chakra imbalance."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important ethical consideration when documenting and interpreting assessment results?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's crucial to avoid practicing medicine without a license and to manage client expectations realistically. Ethical practice emphasizes responsible and transparent communication."
