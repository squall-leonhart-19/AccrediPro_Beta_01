            "question": "Which of the following is the BEST definition of an energy blockage, according to the principles discussed in the module?",
            "options": ["A complete cessation of energy flow.", "An impedance or disruption in the natural flow of energy within the body's energy systems.", "A temporary increase in energy flow due to external stimuli.", "The alignment of all chakras and meridians."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energy blockages are characterized by disruptions or impedances, not complete cessation or temporary increases. They prevent the natural flow."

            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "During a dowsing session, your pendulum swings erratically and inconsistently over a client's solar plexus chakra. What might this indicate?",
            "options": ["The chakra is perfectly balanced.", "The client is dehydrated.", "A potential energy blockage or imbalance within the solar plexus chakra.", "The pendulum is faulty."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Erratic pendulum movement often suggests imbalances or blockages. While dehydration and faulty pendulums are possibilities, the energetic interpretation is the most pertinent."

            "question": "Which intuitive scanning technique involves sensing the energy field with your hands a few inches away from the client's body?",
            "options": ["Aura reading.", "Chakra assessment.", "Hand scanning.", "Meridian tracing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hand scanning, also known as 'sweeping,' involves using the hands to sense the energy field without physical contact."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client reports feeling consistently fatigued and experiencing low self-esteem. Which chakra is MOST likely to be associated with these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Root Chakra.", "Sacral Chakra.", "Solar Plexus Chakra.", "Heart Chakra."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The solar plexus chakra is associated with personal power, self-esteem, and confidence. Imbalances can manifest as fatigue and low self-worth."

            "question": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine, which of the following is a key function of meridians?",
            "options": ["To transport blood throughout the body.", "To regulate hormone production.", "To circulate Qi (vital energy) throughout the body.", "To filter toxins from the lymphatic system."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meridians are pathways for Qi, the vital energy that nourishes and sustains the body."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "During an aura reading, you perceive a dark, dense area near a client's throat chakra. What might this indicate?",
            "options": ["Excellent communication skills.", "A strong connection to their intuition.", "Suppressed emotions or difficulty expressing oneself.", "Optimal physical health."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A dark or dense area in the aura near the throat chakra often suggests challenges related to communication, self-expression, or suppressed emotions."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of integrating multiple assessment techniques to locate a blockage?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on dowsing results.", "Performing a chakra assessment followed by an aura reading to confirm findings.", "Only using intuitive scanning.", "Ignoring client feedback."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating techniques involves using multiple methods to corroborate findings and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the client's energy field."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the case study involving 'Sarah,' the client with chronic shoulder pain, which assessment technique initially revealed a blockage in her meridian system?",
            "options": ["Aura reading.", "Chakra assessment.", "Dowsing.", "Meridian Identification and Assessment."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "As highlighted in the 'Sarah' case study, the meridian assessment was the first technique to identify the blockage linked to her chronic shoulder pain."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "While performing intuitive scanning, you notice a 'sticky' or resistant sensation over a client's sacral chakra. This sensation MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["An overactive chakra.", "A balanced chakra.", "A potential blockage or stagnation of energy.", "An open and flowing chakra."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 'sticky' or resistant sensation during intuitive scanning often suggests a blockage or stagnation of energy in the area."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "A client's aura appears consistently grey and weak throughout. According to the lesson, what is the MOST appropriate initial interpretation?",
            "options": ["The client has a naturally weak aura and is inherently unhealthy.", "The client is likely experiencing significant energy depletion or chronic illness.", "The client is lying about their symptoms.", "The client's aura is reflecting the color of their clothing."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A consistently grey and weak aura often indicates energy depletion, chronic illness, or a significant drain on the client's vital force."
