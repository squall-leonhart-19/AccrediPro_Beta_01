            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST ethical initial response when a client discloses suicidal ideation?",
            "options": ["Immediately refer the client to emergency psychiatric services.", "Attempt to dissuade the client from feeling suicidal through positive affirmations.", "Assess the immediate risk and ensure the client's safety while maintaining a supportive presence.", "Suggest specific crystals known for their calming properties."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing immediate risk and ensuring safety are paramount. While referral is necessary, it's crucial to first establish safety and support. Ethical guidelines prioritize client well-being and require a measured response."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A client experiencing acute grief after the loss of a loved one is struggling with insomnia. Which crystal would be MOST appropriate to incorporate into a calming bedtime ritual, considering energetic properties and potential contraindications?",
            "options": ["Red Jasper, for grounding and energy.", "Lepidolite, for calming and promoting restful sleep.", "Citrine, for joy and optimism.", "Clear Quartz, for amplification of intentions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lepidolite contains lithium, known for its calming properties, making it suitable for insomnia related to grief. Red Jasper might be too stimulating, Citrine is not ideal for sleep, and Clear Quartz could amplify underlying emotional states."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY ethical consideration when working with a trauma survivor who is also undergoing crystal healing?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the client is not overspending on crystals.", "Avoiding any energetic work that could potentially re-traumatize the client.", "Promising complete healing from trauma through crystal therapy.", "Encouraging the client to discontinue any prescribed medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Re-traumatization is a significant risk when working with trauma survivors. Practitioners must prioritize client safety and avoid any techniques that could trigger past trauma. Promising cures or advising against medication is unethical and potentially harmful."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "A client in recovery from alcohol addiction reports intense cravings. Which crystal might be helpful in supporting their sobriety, and how should it be presented within the context of a holistic treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Amethyst, presented as a standalone cure for addiction.", "Rose Quartz, to attract romantic love and distract from cravings.", "Amethyst, as a supportive tool alongside therapy, support groups, and medical supervision.", "Tiger's Eye, to increase willpower and eliminate cravings instantly."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Amethyst is often associated with sobriety and can be a supportive tool. However, it should NEVER be presented as a standalone cure. Addiction treatment requires a comprehensive approach involving therapy, support groups, and medical supervision."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "In a complex family dynamic where a client is experiencing emotional abuse from a parent, what is the MOST important step to take before initiating crystal healing sessions?",
            "options": ["Immediately confront the abusive parent.", "Encourage the client to cut off all contact with their family.", "Ensure the client has a strong support system and is receiving appropriate therapy.", "Recommend specific crystals for the abusive parent to wear."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Client safety and well-being are paramount. Ensuring the client has a support system and is in therapy is crucial before addressing the energetic imbalances. Confronting the abuser or recommending crystals for them is inappropriate and potentially harmful."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on integrating crystal healing with other modalities, which of the following is an example of effective integration in a crisis situation?",
            "options": ["Replacing medication with crystal therapy.", "Using crystals to enhance the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety.", "Discouraging clients from seeking medical attention.", "Promising immediate relief from PTSD symptoms using crystals alone."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective integration involves using crystals to complement and enhance other established therapies, such as CBT. Replacing medication or discouraging medical attention is unethical and potentially dangerous. Crystal healing should never be presented as a standalone cure for serious conditions."

        {
            "id": "q28_7",

            "options": ["Eliminating all pain symptoms immediately.", "Addressing the underlying emotional trauma and promoting energetic balance to support overall well-being.", "Replacing pain medication with crystal therapy.", "Diagnosing the client's medical conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study emphasized addressing the root causes of the client's suffering, which included emotional trauma. While pain management was a goal, the primary focus was on promoting energetic balance and overall well-being to support the client's healing journey. Replacing medication or diagnosing conditions is outside the scope of practice."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and disconnected after experiencing a natural disaster. Which combination of crystals might be MOST effective in promoting grounding and emotional stability?",
            "options": ["Amethyst and Clear Quartz.", "Black Tourmaline and Smoky Quartz.", "Citrine and Rose Quartz.", "Lapis Lazuli and Selenite."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Black Tourmaline is known for its grounding properties, and Smoky Quartz helps to release negative energy and promote emotional stability. This combination is particularly helpful after traumatic events that can leave individuals feeling ungrounded and overwhelmed."

        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "What is a key difference between providing support for grief and loss versus addressing suicidal ideation in a crystal healing context?",
            "options": ["Grief and loss require immediate referral to a mental health professional, while suicidal ideation does not.", "Suicidal ideation requires immediate action to ensure safety, while grief and loss involve providing compassionate support and facilitating emotional processing.", "Crystal healing is ineffective for both grief and loss and suicidal ideation.", "Both require the same crystals and techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both situations require compassion and sensitivity, suicidal ideation demands immediate action to ensure the client's safety, including risk assessment and referral. Grief and loss involve providing ongoing support and facilitating emotional processing through appropriate crystal healing techniques and referrals as needed."

            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "According to ethical guidelines discussed in the module, what information MUST be included in the informed consent process when working with clients in crisis situations?",
            "options": ["A guarantee of complete healing.", "A disclaimer that crystal healing is not a substitute for medical or psychiatric treatment.", "A detailed explanation of the practitioner's personal beliefs.", "A promise of immediate relief from all symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent must include a clear disclaimer that crystal healing is not a substitute for medical or psychiatric treatment. This ensures clients understand the limitations of crystal healing and are not misled about its potential benefits. Guaranteeing healing or promising immediate relief is unethical and inaccurate."
