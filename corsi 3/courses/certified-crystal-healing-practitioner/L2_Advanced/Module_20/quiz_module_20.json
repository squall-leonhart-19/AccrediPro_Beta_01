            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of dowsing in the context of energy assessment?",
            "options": ["Randomly swinging a pendulum for divination.", "Using tools like pendulums or rods to detect subtle energies and imbalances.", "A form of physical exercise using metal rods.", "Predicting future events with a forked stick."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dowsing involves using tools to detect subtle energies and imbalances, not random movements or fortune-telling."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client presents with persistent fatigue and muscle weakness. During muscle testing, you find that their deltoid muscle consistently tests weak when holding a piece of rose quartz. What is the MOST likely interpretation?",
            "options": ["The client is allergic to rose quartz.", "The rose quartz is amplifying an underlying energy imbalance related to the heart chakra.", "The client is dehydrated.", "The muscle test is invalid and needs to be repeated with a different muscle."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A weak muscle test while holding a specific crystal suggests a potential energy imbalance related to the crystal's properties (in this case, the heart chakra associated with rose quartz)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "In intuitive scanning, what does 'clairvoyance' primarily refer to?",
            "options": ["The ability to hear voices from the spirit world.", "The ability to experience physical sensations related to another person's energy field.", "The ability to see energy fields, colors, or images related to a person's aura or energy system.", "The ability to taste different energies."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clairvoyance, in the context of intuitive scanning, refers to clear seeing, which includes perceiving energy fields and related visual information."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which biofeedback device measures skin conductance to assess stress levels and autonomic nervous system activity?",
            "options": ["Electrocardiogram (ECG)", "Electromyography (EMG)", "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor", "Electroencephalogram (EEG)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor measures changes in skin conductance, which reflect activity in the autonomic nervous system and can indicate stress levels."

            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "The A.L.I.G.N. Framework™ emphasizes a holistic approach. What does the 'N' in A.L.I.G.N. stand for?",
            "options": ["Nutrition", "Nurture", "Network", "Nature"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the A.L.I.G.N. Framework™, 'N' stands for Nurture, emphasizing the importance of self-care, emotional support, and creating a supportive environment for healing."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When documenting assessment results, why is it crucial to include the specific crystal used, the muscle tested (in kinesiology), and the client's subjective experience?",
            "options": ["To create a longer report.", "To provide a comprehensive and reproducible record of the assessment process.", "To impress other practitioners.", "To justify the cost of the session."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Detailed documentation ensures that the assessment can be understood, reproduced, and compared over time, providing a clear picture of the client's progress."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "According to a case study, a client named Sarah, struggling with anxiety, showed a significant decrease in GSR readings after a 20-minute crystal healing session using amethyst. What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["Amethyst is a placebo.", "The client's anxiety was not real.", "The crystal healing session may have helped to regulate the client's autonomic nervous system activity and reduce stress.", "The GSR device was malfunctioning."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A decrease in GSR readings indicates reduced sympathetic nervous system activation, suggesting that the session may have helped to calm the client's anxiety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "You are using a pendulum to assess a client's chakra system. The pendulum swings strongly clockwise over the heart chakra but weakly and erratically over the solar plexus chakra. What might this indicate?",
            "options": ["The client is left-handed.", "The client has a strong and balanced heart chakra but a potentially blocked or imbalanced solar plexus chakra.", "The pendulum is faulty.", "The client is not receptive to energy work."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong, clockwise swing typically indicates balanced energy flow, while a weak or erratic swing suggests a potential imbalance or blockage in the corresponding chakra."

        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is MOST important to consider when interpreting the results of an energy assessment?",
            "options": ["The practitioner's personal biases.", "The client's expectations and beliefs.", "The alignment of the planets.", "The color of the client's aura."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The client's expectations and beliefs can significantly influence the results of energy assessments. It's important to consider the placebo effect and the client's openness to the process."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "During an advanced assessment, you notice a consistent pattern: muscle testing reveals weakness when the client holds crystals associated with the root chakra, combined with intuitive readings indicating feelings of insecurity and instability. How should you proceed?",
            "options": ["Conclude that the client needs a different crystal.", "Focus solely on balancing the root chakra through grounding techniques and addressing feelings of insecurity.", "Refer the client to a medical doctor immediately.", "Integrate the assessment findings to develop a holistic treatment plan addressing the root chakra imbalance and the associated emotional and energetic patterns."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A holistic approach involves integrating information from multiple assessment methods to create a comprehensive understanding of the client's needs and to develop an effective treatment plan."
