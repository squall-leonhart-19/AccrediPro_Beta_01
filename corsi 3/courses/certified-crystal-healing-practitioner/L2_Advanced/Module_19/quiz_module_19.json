        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following research methodologies is generally considered to provide the strongest evidence for cause-and-effect relationships?",
            "options": ["Observational studies", "Case reports", "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)", "Expert opinions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RCTs, with their random assignment and control groups, are designed to minimize bias and establish causality."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "What is a 'p-value' in statistical hypothesis testing?",
            "options": ["The probability of the null hypothesis being true", "The probability of observing results as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed results if the null hypothesis is true", "The probability of the alternative hypothesis being true", "The effect size of the intervention"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The p-value indicates the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key element in evaluating the quality of a research study?",
            "options": ["Sample size", "Conflict of interest disclosure", "Statistical significance", "The researcher's personal beliefs about crystal healing"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While sample size, conflict of interest disclosure, and statistical significance are crucial elements, the researcher's personal beliefs are irrelevant to the study's methodological quality."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A meta-analysis combines the results of multiple studies to:",
            "options": ["Increase the sample size of a single study", "Provide a qualitative summary of the literature", "Calculate an overall effect size and assess consistency across studies", "Focus on only the studies that support a specific hypothesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses use statistical methods to synthesize findings from multiple independent studies, providing a more precise estimate of the effect and examining heterogeneity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' presented in the module, who experienced reduced anxiety symptoms after crystal healing sessions, what is the most important limitation to consider when generalizing these findings?",
            "options": ["Sarah's age", "The lack of a control group", "The type of crystals used", "The duration of the sessions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Without a control group, it's impossible to determine whether Sarah's improvement was due to the crystal healing or other factors (e.g., placebo effect, spontaneous remission)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "What does 'publication bias' refer to in the context of research?",
            "options": ["The tendency for journals to publish only positive results", "Bias introduced by the researcher's choice of publication venue", "Bias in the peer-review process", "The tendency for researchers to publish only in high-impact journals"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Publication bias occurs when studies with statistically significant or positive results are more likely to be published than studies with null or negative results, potentially skewing the overall evidence base."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When communicating about crystal healing, which statement best reflects responsible communication?",
            "options": ["'This crystal will cure your disease!'", "'Crystals have been scientifically proven to heal all ailments.'", "'While some people find crystal healing helpful, more research is needed to understand its effects.'", "'Doctors don't want you to know about the power of crystals.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Responsible communication involves acknowledging the limitations of current research, avoiding exaggerated claims, and respecting conventional medical practices."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'double-blind' study design?",
            "options": ["To ensure that the study is conducted ethically", "To prevent both the participants and researchers from knowing who is receiving the active treatment", "To increase the sample size", "To simplify the data analysis process"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Double-blinding minimizes bias by preventing both participants and researchers from knowing who is receiving the treatment, reducing the risk of placebo effects and experimenter bias."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "According to the module, what is one potential avenue for future research in crystal healing?",
            "options": ["Developing new types of crystals", "Investigating the placebo effect in crystal healing", "Ignoring skeptical viewpoints", "Relying solely on anecdotal evidence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Further research is needed to disentangle the specific effects of crystals from the placebo effect and other contextual factors."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A client tells you they found a study 'proving' that amethyst eliminates all anxiety. What critical question should you ask yourself first when evaluating this claim?",
            "options": ["What is the client's favorite color?", "Who funded the study and what is the study's methodology?", "Does the client sell amethyst?", "How much did the client pay for the amethyst?"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing the source of funding and the methodology used in the study are crucial steps in determining the credibility and reliability of the research findings."
