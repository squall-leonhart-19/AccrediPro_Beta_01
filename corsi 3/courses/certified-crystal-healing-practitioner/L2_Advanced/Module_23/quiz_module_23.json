            "question": "Which geometric pattern in advanced crystal grids is MOST associated with manifestation and abundance?",
            "options": ["Square", "Triangle", "Hexagon", "Vesica Piscis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The hexagon, with its six points and connection to sacred geometry, is frequently used in crystal grids designed for attracting abundance and manifesting goals. Its structure represents harmony and interconnectedness, facilitating a powerful flow of energy."

            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Crystal Elixirs, what type of elixir preparation method is generally considered the SAFEST for internal consumption?",
            "options": ["Direct Method with Quartz", "Indirect Method with Rose Quartz", "Direct Method with Malachite", "Indirect Method with Pyrite"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The indirect method, particularly with a generally safe crystal like Rose Quartz, is considered the safest for internal consumption as it prevents direct contact between the crystal and the water. This minimizes the risk of contamination or ingestion of potentially toxic substances."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "Case Study: A client reports feeling disconnected and lacking purpose. Which crystal skull placement would be MOST appropriate to address these issues?",
            "options": ["At the feet", "Above the head (crown chakra)", "On the solar plexus", "In the left hand"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Placing a crystal skull above the head, near the crown chakra, can help to stimulate spiritual connection and enhance a sense of purpose. This placement aims to open the individual to higher consciousness and facilitate a deeper understanding of their life path."

            "question": "Which advanced crystal layout is BEST suited for balancing ALL seven major chakras simultaneously?",
            "options": ["Linear layout along the spine", "Circular layout around the body", "Star-shaped layout with a central crystal", "Triangular layout focusing on the lower chakras"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A linear layout along the spine, with crystals corresponding to each chakra, allows for a direct and focused flow of energy through the entire chakra system, promoting balance and alignment from the root to the crown."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "When programming a crystal for a specific intention, what is the recommended duration to hold the crystal during the visualization process?",
            "options": ["10 seconds", "1 minute", "5-10 minutes", "30 minutes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Holding the crystal for 5-10 minutes during visualization allows for a deeper energetic connection and more effective imprinting of the intention. This extended duration ensures that the crystal fully absorbs the desired frequency and program."
