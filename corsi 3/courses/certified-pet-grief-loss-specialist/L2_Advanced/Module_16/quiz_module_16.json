            "question": "In the case study involving a child facing the impending euthanasia of their pet, which of the following is the MOST crucial element in facilitating healthy anticipatory grief?",
            "options": ["Avoiding the topic to protect the child's feelings.", "Presenting euthanasia as a purely medical decision.", "Encouraging open and honest communication about the pet's condition and impending loss.", "Focusing solely on the positive memories to avoid sadness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open and honest communication allows the child to process their emotions, ask questions, and prepare for the loss in a healthy way. Studies show that children who are included in the process of end-of-life care for pets experience less complicated grief later on."

            "question": "A resident in a nursing home has experienced the loss of their companion animal, a goldfish. Considering the concept of disenfranchised grief, what is the MOST appropriate response from the facility staff?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the loss, as a goldfish is not considered a significant companion animal.", "Acknowledging the loss and providing opportunities for the resident to express their grief.", "Suggesting the resident quickly replace the goldfish with another pet.", "Minimizing the resident's feelings by stating 'It was just a fish.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disenfranchised grief refers to grief that is not openly acknowledged or socially supported. Acknowledging the loss, regardless of the type of animal, validates the resident's feelings and provides crucial support."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue stems from chronic exposure to trauma. Self-care strategies, including setting boundaries, seeking support from colleagues or therapists, and engaging in activities that promote well-being, are essential for managing and preventing compassion fatigue. A 2021 study in the *Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine* showed improved well-being scores in veterinary staff who actively practiced self-care."
