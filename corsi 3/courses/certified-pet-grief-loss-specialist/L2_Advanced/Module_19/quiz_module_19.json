            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which grief model, as discussed in the module, emphasizes the importance of adapting to loss rather than necessarily 'recovering' from it?",
            "options": ["Kübler-Ross Model", "Bowlby's Attachment Theory", "Dual Process Model", "Worden's Tasks of Mourning"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Dual Process Model highlights the oscillation between loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping mechanisms as individuals adapt to their loss."

            "question": "A client, Sarah, is struggling with intense guilt after euthanizing her terminally ill dog. Which evidence-based intervention would be MOST appropriate to address this specific issue?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT can help Sarah identify and challenge the negative thoughts and beliefs contributing to her feelings of guilt, leading to more adaptive coping strategies."

            "options": ["Having a strong social support network", "The pet dying of old age", "Ambiguous loss circumstances (e.g., a lost pet)", "Having previously experienced pet loss without complications"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ambiguous loss, where the pet's fate is uncertain, can significantly increase the risk of complicated grief due to the lack of closure."

            "question": "When critically evaluating research on pet loss, what is an important factor to consider regarding the study's sample?",
            "options": ["The researcher's personal experience with pet loss", "Whether the sample is representative of the broader pet-owning population", "The use of qualitative research methods", "The length of the study period"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A representative sample ensures that the study's findings can be generalized to a larger population of pet owners experiencing grief."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A study found a correlation of 0.65 between attachment level to a pet and grief intensity after loss. What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["There is no relationship between attachment and grief.", "Higher attachment is associated with lower grief intensity.", "Higher attachment is associated with higher grief intensity.", "Attachment level causes grief intensity."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A positive correlation of 0.65 indicates a moderately strong relationship where higher attachment levels tend to be associated with more intense grief responses."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "You are reviewing a research article on interventions for pet loss grief. The study claims a new therapy is 'highly effective' based on anecdotal evidence from 5 participants. What is the MOST significant limitation of this claim?",
            "options": ["The study used a qualitative approach.", "The sample size is too small to draw definitive conclusions.", "The study did not include a control group.", "Anecdotal evidence is inherently unreliable."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A sample size of only 5 participants is insufficient to generalize the findings to a larger population, making the claim of 'highly effective' premature and potentially misleading."
