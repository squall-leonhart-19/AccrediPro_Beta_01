            "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically covered by data privacy laws like GDPR or HIPAA when providing pet grief support?",
            "options": ["Client's name and contact information", "Client's pet's name and breed", "Client's emotional state during a session", "The specific therapeutic techniques used during a session"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While client's emotional state and pet details are sensitive, the specific therapeutic techniques used are generally considered the practitioner's intellectual property and not subject to data privacy laws in the same way."

            "options": ["Shielded from personal liability for business debts and lawsuits.", "Required to file a separate business tax return.", "Personally liable for business debts and lawsuits.", "Exempt from obtaining business licenses."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In a sole proprietorship, the business and the individual are legally the same entity, meaning the owner is personally liable for business debts and lawsuits. This is a key risk to consider when choosing a business structure."

            "id": "q33_3",
            "question": "Which of the following statements about advertising pet grief support services is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["It is acceptable to guarantee specific outcomes, such as complete grief resolution, to attract clients.", "Testimonials from clients can be used without obtaining explicit written consent.", "Claims about the effectiveness of services should be supported by evidence and avoid misleading statements.", "It is permissible to compare your services directly to competitors without any substantiation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Advertising must be truthful and non-misleading. Guaranteeing outcomes is unethical and potentially illegal. Testimonials require consent, and comparisons to competitors should be fair and substantiated."

            "question": "According to the lesson, what percentage of complaints against therapists relate to boundary violations?",

            "options": ["A detailed description of the therapist's personal experiences with pet loss.", "A guarantee of complete confidentiality, regardless of legal obligations.", "A clear explanation of the services offered, fees, and cancellation policies.", "A statement that the therapist is not responsible for any emotional distress experienced by the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent must clearly outline the services, fees, and policies to ensure the client understands what they are agreeing to. Guarantees of absolute confidentiality are unrealistic, and disclaiming responsibility for emotional distress is unethical."

            "question": "A client discloses that they are neglecting their surviving pets due to grief. Ethically, what is your FIRST course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately report the client to animal welfare authorities.", "Continue the grief support session without addressing the pet neglect.", "Explore the client's feelings and reasons for the neglect, while emphasizing the importance of animal welfare.", "Terminate the therapeutic relationship immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While reporting might be necessary eventually, the first step is to explore the client's feelings and educate them about responsible pet ownership. This allows for a therapeutic approach while prioritizing animal welfare. If the client refuses to address the neglect, reporting may become necessary."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accessibility guidelines require alt text for images to make websites usable for people with visual impairments. Jargon, distracting animations, and omitting important information violate accessibility principles."

            "explanation": "A service agreement clarifies the roles, responsibilities, and expectations of both the therapist and the client, minimizing misunderstandings and potential disputes. It doesn't guarantee outcomes or eliminate all liability."
