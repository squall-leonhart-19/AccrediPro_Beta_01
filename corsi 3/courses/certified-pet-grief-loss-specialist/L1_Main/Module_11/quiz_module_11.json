            "question": "Which of the following is a core tenet of Attachment Theory, as it applies to pet loss grief?",
            "options": ["Grief is primarily a cognitive process.", "Attachment bonds are easily replaced after a loss.", "The intensity of grief is directly proportional to the length of ownership.", "Disruptions in attachment bonds can lead to significant emotional distress."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Attachment Theory posits that the emotional bond with a pet is a significant attachment, and its disruption through loss can cause substantial grief. This aligns with Bowlby's original work on human attachment."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to Boss's Ambiguous Loss theory, what is the primary difference between physical and psychological absence in the context of pet loss?",
            "options": ["Physical absence always leads to more intense grief than psychological absence.", "Psychological absence refers to situations where the pet is physically present but not acting like themselves due to illness or injury, while physical absence is the pet's death.", "Ambiguous loss only applies to human relationships, not pet relationships.", "There is no significant difference; both types of absence result in the same grieving process."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boss's theory highlights that psychological absence, such as when a pet is present but 'not themselves' due to illness, creates unique challenges in grieving because the loss is unclear and ongoing."

            "question": "A client reports experiencing intense guilt and rumination after their pet's euthanasia, questioning if they made the right decision.

            "options": ["An antihistamine for anxiety.", "A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for obsessive thoughts and depressive symptoms.", "A stimulant medication to improve focus.", "An antipsychotic medication for sleep disturbances."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

Medication should always be considered in conjunction with therapy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Children need honest, age-appropriate explanations and validation of their feelings to process grief healthily. Avoiding the topic or using abstract language can be confusing and unhelpful."

            "question": "In some cultures, animals are seen as reincarnated ancestors. How might this belief impact the grieving process for pet loss?",
            "options": ["It would likely intensify grief due to the perceived loss of a family member.", "It might offer comfort and a sense of continuity, potentially easing the grieving process.", "It would have no impact on the grieving process.", "It would encourage immediate replacement of the pet with another animal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural beliefs about reincarnation can provide a framework for understanding death and loss, potentially offering comfort and mitigating the intensity of grief by suggesting a continued connection or future reunion."

            "options": ["Using vague language and metaphors to soften the blow.", "Providing concrete, literal explanations and visual aids.", "Avoiding the topic altogether to prevent emotional distress.", "Encouraging the client to suppress their emotions and move on quickly."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the client's reported hopelessness and disconnection, assessing for suicidal ideation is the priority. Complicated grief can significantly increase the risk of suicide, especially after the loss of a service animal which represents a profound loss of independence and support."
