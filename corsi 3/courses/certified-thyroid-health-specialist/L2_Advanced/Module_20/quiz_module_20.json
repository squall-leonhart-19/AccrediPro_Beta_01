        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY advantage of using a comprehensive thyroid health questionnaire as an initial assessment tool?",
            "options": ["It eliminates the need for any lab testing.", "It provides a structured framework for identifying potential thyroid-related symptoms and risk factors.", "It guarantees a definitive diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction.", "It is less time-consuming than a standard doctor's visit."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Comprehensive questionnaires help structure the assessment process, uncovering potential symptoms and risk factors that might be missed in a standard consultation, guiding further investigation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A patient's lab results show elevated TSH, low Free T4, and normal Free T3. Which of the following is the MOST likely interpretation?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "Subclinical Hyperthyroidism", "Primary Hypothyroidism", "T3 Dominance"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated TSH and low Free T4 strongly suggest primary hypothyroidism, indicating the thyroid gland itself is underactive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which functional medicine assessment is MOST directly aimed at evaluating the body's ability to convert T4 to the more active T3?",
            "options": ["Adrenal Stress Index", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "Reverse T3 testing", "Organic Acids Test"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 testing directly assesses levels of this inactive form of T3, providing insights into potential conversion issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "During a physical examination for thyroid assessment, what might a goiter indicate?",
            "options": ["Normal thyroid function", "Hyperthyroidism only", "Hypothyroidism only", "Either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, or other thyroid conditions"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) can be present in various thyroid conditions, including both hyper- and hypothyroidism, as well as in cases of iodine deficiency or thyroid nodules."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "Which dietary assessment tool is MOST effective for identifying potential food sensitivities that may be impacting thyroid function?",
            "options": ["A 3-day food diary", "The Dietary Guidelines for Americans", "An elimination diet followed by food reintroduction", "Macronutrient ratio analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Elimination diets help identify trigger foods by systematically removing and then reintroducing common allergens, allowing observation of symptom changes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "According to research, exposure to which environmental toxin has been MOST consistently linked to thyroid dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Phthalates", "Bisphenol A (BPA)", "Perchlorate", "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perchlorate, found in rocket fuel and some fertilizers, can interfere with iodine uptake by the thyroid, disrupting hormone synthesis. Studies have shown a correlation between perchlorate exposure and elevated TSH levels in populations with iodine deficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A patient presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. While considering hypothyroidism, what other condition should be ruled out FIRST due to overlapping symptoms?",
            "options": ["Iron deficiency anemia", "Vitamin D deficiency", "Chronic Kidney Disease", "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency anemia shares many symptoms with hypothyroidism (fatigue, weakness, hair loss), and is a common condition that should be ruled out before further thyroid investigation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with persistent fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her lab results show a TSH of 5.0 mIU/L (reference range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and normal Free T4. She reports no known environmental toxin exposure. Based ONLY on this information, what is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Immediately prescribe thyroid hormone replacement therapy.", "Recommend a comprehensive environmental toxin assessment.", "Repeat thyroid lab testing and assess for TPO antibodies.", "Advise the client to increase their iodine intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the slightly elevated TSH and normal Free T4, repeating the thyroid panel and checking for TPO antibodies is the most prudent initial step to assess for subclinical hypothyroidism or Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "Which lab test is MOST useful in assessing autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
            "options": ["Free T3", "Reverse T3", "Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) antibodies", "Thyroglobulin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TPO antibodies are highly indicative of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the thyroid gland."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is MOST important when synthesizing assessment data to create a personalized action plan for a client with suspected thyroid dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on lab results for diagnosis.", "Ignoring the client's subjective experience and symptoms.", "Prioritizing pharmaceutical interventions over lifestyle modifications.", "Considering the interconnectedness of thyroid health with other body systems and lifestyle factors."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A holistic approach is crucial. Thyroid health is influenced by many factors, including gut health, adrenal function, nutrient status, and lifestyle. A personalized plan must address these interconnected elements."
