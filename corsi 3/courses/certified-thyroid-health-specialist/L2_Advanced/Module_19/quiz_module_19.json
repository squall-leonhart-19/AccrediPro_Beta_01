            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following study designs is generally considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of a new thyroid medication?",
            "options": ["Case-control study", "Cohort study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Cross-sectional study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "RCTs are considered the gold standard because they minimize bias through randomization and control groups, allowing for stronger causal inferences."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A meta-analysis combines the results of multiple studies. What is the primary benefit of conducting a meta-analysis in thyroid research?",
            "options": ["To increase the sample size and statistical power", "To reduce the cost of research", "To eliminate publication bias", "To simplify the interpretation of individual studies"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses increase statistical power by pooling data from multiple studies, leading to more robust and reliable conclusions."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is publication bias, and how can it affect the interpretation of thyroid research?",
            "options": ["The tendency for researchers to publish only positive results", "The tendency for researchers to publish only negative results", "The tendency for researchers to publish only studies with large sample sizes", "The tendency for researchers to publish only studies funded by pharmaceutical companies"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Publication bias, where only positive results are published, can lead to an overestimation of the true effect of an intervention in thyroid health."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "According to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, what is the recommended TSH range for most adults?",
            "options": ["0.01-0.1 mIU/L", "0.4-4.0 mIU/L", "5.0-10.0 mIU/L", "10.0-20.0 mIU/L"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ATA generally recommends a TSH range of 0.4-4.0 mIU/L for most adults, although individual targets may vary based on specific clinical circumstances."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In a study evaluating the effect of selenium supplementation on Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the results show a p-value of 0.06. What does this p-value indicate?",
            "options": ["The results are statistically significant at the 0.05 level", "The results are not statistically significant at the 0.05 level", "The results are clinically significant", "The results are likely due to chance alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05, indicating that the results are not statistically significant."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which database is most comprehensive for finding systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to thyroid disorders?",
            "options": ["PubMed", "Cochrane Library", "Scopus", "Web of Science"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Cochrane Library is specifically designed for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, making it the most comprehensive resource for this type of evidence."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is interested in using ashwagandha to manage their symptoms. What is the MOST important step to take based on evidence-based practice?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend ashwagandha based on anecdotal evidence.", "Consult the client's endocrinologist for approval.", "Search for and critically appraise the available research on ashwagandha and Hashimoto's.", "Recommend a specific brand of ashwagandha."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice requires a thorough evaluation of the available research to determine the potential benefits and risks of an intervention."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A study reports a relative risk (RR) of 1.5 for developing hypothyroidism in individuals with high iodine intake compared to those with normal iodine intake. What does this RR indicate?",
            "options": ["Individuals with high iodine intake are 1.5 times less likely to develop hypothyroidism.", "Individuals with high iodine intake are 1.5 times more likely to develop hypothyroidism.", "High iodine intake causes hypothyroidism in all individuals.", "High iodine intake has no effect on the risk of hypothyroidism."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A relative risk of 1.5 indicates that individuals with high iodine intake have a 50% higher risk of developing hypothyroidism compared to those with normal iodine intake."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In the case study of Sarah, a 45-year-old woman with subclinical hypothyroidism, lifestyle interventions including stress reduction and regular exercise were implemented. What is the primary research-supported mechanism by which these interventions may improve thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Direct stimulation of thyroid hormone production", "Reduction of inflammation and improved HPA axis regulation", "Increased iodine absorption from the diet", "Decreased TSH receptor sensitivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress reduction and exercise can help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and reduce inflammation, both of which can positively impact thyroid function."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is a critical appraisal tool used to assess the risk of bias in randomized controlled trials?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement is a widely used tool for assessing the quality and risk of bias in randomized controlled trials."
