            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "A 35-year-old female with Hashimoto's presents with persistent fatigue, despite a TSH within the reference range. Further investigation reveals low ferritin (15 ng/mL) and Vitamin D (20 ng/mL). Based on the module's recommendations, what is the MOST appropriate initial step?",
            "options": ["Initiate T3-only therapy.", "Prescribe a high-dose iodine supplement.", "Address the nutrient deficiencies with appropriate supplementation.", "Increase the patient's levothyroxine dosage."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing nutrient deficiencies is crucial in Hashimoto's patients, as these deficiencies can exacerbate symptoms even with adequate thyroid hormone replacement. Correcting ferritin and Vitamin D levels may significantly improve fatigue before considering more aggressive thyroid hormone interventions."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A patient with Graves' disease experiences a significant exacerbation of symptoms following a period of intense stress. Which of the following mechanisms BEST explains this phenomenon?",
            "options": ["Increased TSH secretion due to stress hormones.", "Suppression of the immune system, leading to decreased thyroid antibody production.", "Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased cortisol production, impacting thyroid hormone conversion.", "Direct stimulation of thyroid hormone release by stress hormones."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Stress and increased cortisol levels can impair the conversion of T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, leading to a worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms. The HPA axis plays a significant role in this process."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "Ultrasound reveals a thyroid nodule in a 45-year-old male. The nodule is 1.5 cm, solid, hypoechoic, and has irregular margins. According to the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology, which of the following actions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Routine follow-up in 2 years.", "Thyroid scintigraphy to assess nodule function.", "Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.", "Empirical treatment with levothyroxine to suppress nodule growth."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Based on the ultrasound characteristics (solid, hypoechoic, irregular margins), the nodule has suspicious features, warranting FNA biopsy to evaluate for malignancy."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A 60-year-old female is diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 6.5 mIU/L, normal free T4). She is asymptomatic and has no family history of thyroid disease. According to the guidelines discussed in the module, what is the MOST appropriate initial management strategy?",
            "options": ["Initiate levothyroxine treatment immediately.", "Monitor TSH levels every 6-12 months and re-evaluate if symptoms develop.", "Prescribe a trial of T3-only therapy.", "Recommend a high-dose iodine supplement."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In asymptomatic individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and no risk factors, a 'watch and wait' approach with regular monitoring is often appropriate. Intervention is usually considered if symptoms develop or TSH levels significantly increase."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents 6 months postpartum with symptoms of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, palpitations, weight loss). Her TSH is suppressed, and free T4 is elevated. She likely has postpartum thyroiditis. What is the MOST appropriate initial treatment?",
            "options": ["Radioactive iodine ablation.", "Beta-blockers for symptom management.", "Propylthiouracil (PTU) to block thyroid hormone synthesis.", "Levothyroxine to suppress thyroid hormone production."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the hyperthyroid phase of postpartum thyroiditis, beta-blockers are often used to manage symptoms like anxiety and palpitations. Antithyroid medications are generally not indicated, as the hyperthyroidism is due to thyroid hormone release, not overproduction."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A patient taking levothyroxine also starts taking calcium carbonate supplements for osteoporosis. What advice should you give regarding the timing of these medications?",
            "options": ["Take levothyroxine and calcium carbonate at the same time to improve absorption.", "Take levothyroxine with breakfast and calcium carbonate with dinner.", "Take levothyroxine at least 4 hours before or after taking calcium carbonate.", "Calcium carbonate does not interact with levothyroxine, so timing is not important."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calcium carbonate can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine. It is important to advise patients to take levothyroxine at least 4 hours before or after taking calcium carbonate to ensure optimal absorption of the thyroid medication."

            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "A patient with a history of thyroid cancer is undergoing radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. What integrative support strategy is MOST appropriate to minimize potential side effects during and after treatment?",
            "options": ["High-dose iodine supplementation to protect the thyroid gland.", "Glutathione supplementation to support detoxification and reduce oxidative stress.", "Strict ketogenic diet to starve cancer cells.", "Discontinuation of all supplements to avoid interference with RAI uptake."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glutathione can help support detoxification and reduce oxidative stress associated with RAI therapy. High-dose iodine is contraindicated, as it would interfere with RAI uptake. A balanced diet and appropriate supplementation, under the guidance of a healthcare professional, are generally recommended."

            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "A 50-year-old male with a history of total thyroidectomy and persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite adequate T4 replacement is being considered for T3-only therapy. Which of the following factors would be a CONTRAINDICATION for this approach?",
            "options": ["History of anxiety and depression.", "Presence of reverse T3 dominance.", "Co-existing cardiovascular disease.", "Elevated thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "T3-only therapy can be risky in patients with cardiovascular disease due to its potential to increase heart rate and blood pressure. It should be used with caution and careful monitoring in such individuals."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis presents with elevated thyroid antibodies (TPO and TgAb). Which of the following interventions has shown evidence in the module to potentially reduce thyroid antibody levels?",
            "options": ["Iodine supplementation.", "Selenium supplementation.", "Gluten-free diet, regardless of celiac disease status.", "Strict vegan diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium supplementation has been shown in some studies to potentially reduce thyroid antibody levels in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. While more research is needed, it is a commonly used integrative approach."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A patient on levothyroxine reports experiencing palpitations and anxiety after starting a new supplement. Which of the following supplements is LEAST likely to interact with levothyroxine?",
            "options": ["Iron sulfate.", "Calcium citrate.", "Magnesium oxide.", "Vitamin C."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Iron, calcium, and magnesium can all interfere with levothyroxine absorption. Vitamin C is less likely to cause a significant interaction. Therefore, Vitamin C is the least likely to interact with levothyroxine."
