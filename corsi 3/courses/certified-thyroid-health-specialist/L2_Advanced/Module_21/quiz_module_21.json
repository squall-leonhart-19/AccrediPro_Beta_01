            "question": "Which element of the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™ focuses on identifying and addressing underlying infections that may be contributing to thyroid dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Gut Health", "Lifestyle", "Assessment", "Nutrient Deficiencies"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'G' in G.L.A.N.D. stands for Gut Health, which encompasses identifying and addressing gut-related issues, including infections that can impact thyroid function."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her TSH is slightly elevated (4.8 mIU/L), and she reports high stress levels due to work. According to the principles of prioritizing treatment goals, what should be the FIRST area of focus?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting thyroid hormone replacement", "Implementing stress management techniques", "Initiating a strict gluten-free diet", "Prescribing high-dose selenium supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's high stress levels and slightly elevated TSH, addressing stress management should be the initial focus. High stress can exacerbate thyroid symptoms and interfere with thyroid hormone conversion. Addressing lifestyle factors is often the first step in a client-centered approach."

        {
            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary recommendations is MOST appropriate for a client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
            "options": ["A high-iodine diet to stimulate thyroid hormone production", "A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables to support detoxification", "A gluten-free diet to reduce autoimmune reactivity", "A diet high in processed foods to provide quick energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A gluten-free diet is often recommended for individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to the potential for cross-reactivity between gluten and thyroid tissue, which can exacerbate autoimmune responses."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A client is taking levothyroxine and reports persistent fatigue despite normal TSH levels. Which supplement might be considered to support T4 to T3 conversion?",
            "options": ["Calcium", "Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is essential for the enzyme deiodinase, which converts T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) to T3 (active thyroid hormone). Supplementing with selenium may support this conversion process and improve symptoms in clients with persistent fatigue despite normal TSH."

            "id": "q21_5",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle modifications is MOST beneficial for improving sleep hygiene in a client with hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Drinking caffeine before bed", "Establishing a regular sleep-wake schedule", "Exercising vigorously right before sleep", "Using electronic devices in bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a regular sleep-wake schedule helps regulate the body's natural circadian rhythm, which can improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue associated with hypothyroidism. Consistent sleep patterns are crucial for optimal thyroid function and overall well-being."

        {
            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A client's initial treatment plan included dietary changes, stress management techniques, and selenium supplementation. After 3 months, their TSH has decreased slightly, but their T3 levels remain low, and they still experience fatigue. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Increase the dosage of selenium significantly", "Add T3 medication to their treatment plan (requires physician collaboration)", "Discontinue all supplements and focus solely on dietary changes", "Advise the client to accept that their fatigue may not improve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the persistent low T3 levels and continued fatigue despite initial interventions, adding T3 medication may be necessary. This requires collaboration with a healthcare professional to prescribe and monitor the medication appropriately."

            "id": "q21_7",
            "question": "When collaborating with a client's endocrinologist, which of the following pieces of information is MOST important to share regarding your nutritional and supplement recommendations?",
            "options": ["Your personal opinions on thyroid health", "A detailed list of all foods the client consumes", "The specific dosages and forms of supplements you are recommending", "A general overview of healthy eating habits"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sharing the specific dosages and forms of supplements is crucial for the endocrinologist to understand the client's complete treatment plan and potential interactions with medications. This ensures coordinated and safe care."

            "id": "q21_8",
            "question": "In the case study of Maria, the 38-year-old with subclinical hypothyroidism, what was a key factor that contributed to her initial thyroid imbalance?",
            "options": ["Excessive iodine intake", "Chronic stress and poor sleep", "Strict vegetarian diet", "Exposure to mold"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Maria's case study, chronic stress and poor sleep hygiene were identified as significant contributing factors to her subclinical hypothyroidism. Addressing these lifestyle factors was crucial in her treatment plan."

            "id": "q21_9",
            "question": "According to research by Romm et al. (2017), which adaptogenic herb has shown promise in supporting thyroid function by modulating the HPA axis and reducing stress?",
            "options": ["Ginseng", "Rhodiola Rosea", "St. John's Wort", "Valerian Root"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Romm et al. (2017) highlighted Rhodiola Rosea as a potential adaptogenic herb for supporting thyroid function by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and reducing stress, which can indirectly benefit thyroid health."

            "options": ["Reducing fiber intake", "Increasing water intake and incorporating regular physical activity", "Taking a laxative daily", "Avoiding probiotic-rich foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increasing water intake and incorporating regular physical activity are effective strategies to address constipation. Adequate hydration and movement help stimulate bowel function and improve digestive health, which is often compromised in individuals with hypothyroidism."
