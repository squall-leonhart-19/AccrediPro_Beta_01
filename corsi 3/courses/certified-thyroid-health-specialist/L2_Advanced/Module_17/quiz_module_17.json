        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue, constipation, and hair loss. Initial TSH is within the reference range, but free T3 is low. Which condition should be MOST strongly considered, according to the lesson on Non-Thyroidal Illness Syndrome (NTIS)?",
            "options": ["Hashimoto's thyroiditis", "Graves' disease", "Non-Thyroidal Illness Syndrome (NTIS)", "Subacute thyroiditis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "NTIS, also known as euthyroid sick syndrome, is characterized by abnormal thyroid hormone levels (often low T3) in the presence of normal TSH, frequently occurring in critically ill patients or those under significant physiological stress."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A 42-year-old female client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis reports persistent fatigue despite adequate T4 replacement. Further testing reveals low morning cortisol levels. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step?",
            "options": ["Increase T4 dosage", "Prescribe T3 medication", "Refer for comprehensive adrenal function testing", "Recommend a high-intensity exercise program"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low morning cortisol levels in a patient with autoimmune thyroid disease suggest possible adrenal dysfunction. Further comprehensive testing is needed before initiating treatment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client on levothyroxine reports continued hypothyroid symptoms despite a normal TSH. What is the FIRST step to consider in addressing potential thyroid medication resistance?",
            "options": ["Switch to a T3/T4 combination medication immediately.", "Assess medication adherence and absorption issues.", "Immediately increase the levothyroxine dosage.", "Order a thyroid ultrasound."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Before changing medication or increasing dosage, it's crucial to rule out basic issues like non-adherence, improper medication storage, or absorption problems (e.g., taking it with calcium or iron supplements)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client with hypothyroidism also experiences significant anxiety and panic attacks. Which of the following nutrients should be evaluated FIRST, considering the potential link between thyroid and mood disorders?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency is strongly linked to both thyroid dysfunction and mood disorders like anxiety and depression. Addressing iron levels can often improve both conditions."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A 30-year-old woman with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is trying to conceive. What is the OPTIMAL TSH range to aim for during preconception and pregnancy?",
            "options": [">2.5 mIU/L", "<2.5 mIU/L", "3.0-4.0 mIU/L", "4.0-5.0 mIU/L"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guidelines recommend maintaining a TSH level <2.5 mIU/L during preconception and throughout pregnancy to support optimal fetal development. A study mentioned in the lesson demonstrated increased risk of complications with higher TSH."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "During a thyroid ultrasound, a 1cm solid thyroid nodule is discovered. Which of the following characteristics is MOST indicative of potential malignancy?",
            "options": ["Smooth borders", "Presence of a halo", "Microcalcifications", "Cystic components"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Microcalcifications within a thyroid nodule are a strong indicator of potential malignancy and warrant further investigation, typically with a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A client taking levothyroxine starts a new medication for cholesterol management. Which of the following cholesterol-lowering medications is MOST likely to interfere with levothyroxine absorption?",
            "options": ["Atorvastatin", "Simvastatin", "Cholestyramine", "Ezetimibe"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine can bind to levothyroxine in the gut, reducing its absorption. It's important to separate the administration of these medications by several hours."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client with a family history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is concerned about their own risk. Which genetic factor is MOST strongly associated with increased susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid diseases?",
            "options": ["BRCA1 mutation", "HLA-DR3", "MTHFR C677T polymorphism", "Factor V Leiden"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The HLA-DR3 haplotype is a well-established genetic risk factor for autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease. While other genetic factors play a role, HLA-DR3 is a prominent association."

        {
            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "According to the case study of 'Sarah', a 35-year-old with persistent fatigue despite thyroid hormone replacement, what was the PRIMARY intervention that led to improved energy levels?",
            "options": ["Increased levothyroxine dosage", "Introduction of a gluten-free diet", "Adrenal support with adaptogens", "Initiation of a rigorous exercise program"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the case study, Sarah's fatigue improved significantly after implementing adrenal support using adaptogens, suggesting adrenal dysfunction was contributing to her symptoms despite optimized thyroid hormone levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "A client with a known MTHFR polymorphism is experiencing poor conversion of T4 to T3. Which of the following interventions is MOST likely to support thyroid hormone conversion in this individual?",
            "options": ["Selenium supplementation", "Iron supplementation", "Vitamin D supplementation", "Folate supplementation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While selenium and iron are important for thyroid health, folate is directly involved in methylation processes, which can impact thyroid hormone conversion, especially in individuals with MTHFR polymorphisms. Supplementation with methylated folate may be beneficial."
