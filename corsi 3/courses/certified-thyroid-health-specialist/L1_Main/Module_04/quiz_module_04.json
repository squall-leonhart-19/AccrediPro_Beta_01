            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Low T3 despite normal T4 and TSH suggests impaired T4 to T3 conversion. Identifying and addressing factors that hinder this conversion is crucial for optimizing thyroid hormone action and alleviating symptoms. This is a complex issue and requires further assessment before directly manipulating medication."
