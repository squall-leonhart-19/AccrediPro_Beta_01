            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "According to the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™, what is the FIRST area to investigate during thyroid lab analysis?",
            "options": ["Nutrient Deficiencies", "Thyroid Hormone Levels", "Gut Health", "Inflammation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The G.L.A.N.D. Framework™ prioritizes assessing Thyroid Hormone Levels (TSH, Free T4, Free T3) initially to understand the overall thyroid function before investigating other influencing factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A patient presents with a TSH of 0.3 mIU/L (reference range 0.4-4.0 mIU/L). Which of the following is the MOST likely interpretation?",
            "options": ["Hypothyroidism", "Hyperthyroidism", "Normal thyroid function", "Subclinical Hypothyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A TSH below the reference range typically indicates hyperthyroidism, suggesting the thyroid gland is overactive."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Free T4 represents:",
            "options": ["T4 bound to proteins in the blood", "The inactive form of thyroid hormone", "T4 that is unbound and available to enter cells", "The primary hormone produced by the pituitary gland"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Free T4 is the portion of T4 that is not bound to proteins and is therefore available to enter cells and be converted to T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Which of the following statements regarding Reverse T3 (rT3) is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["rT3 is more potent than T3.", "Elevated rT3 always indicates thyroid dysfunction.", "rT3 can be elevated due to stress, inflammation, or dieting.", "rT3 directly stimulates TSH production."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "rT3 production can increase under stress, inflammation, or calorie restriction as a protective mechanism, not always indicating primary thyroid disease. It acts as a 'brake' on thyroid function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Elevated levels of Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) MOST strongly suggest:",
            "options": ["Thyroid cancer", "Iodine deficiency", "Autoimmune thyroid disease", "Pituitary tumor"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The presence of TPOAb and TgAb are hallmarks of autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A comprehensive thyroid panel, beyond basic TSH and Free T4, ideally includes:",
            "options": ["TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, Thyroid Antibodies", "TSH, Total T4, Total T3", "TSH, Free T4, T3 Uptake", "TSH, Free T4, TSH Receptor Antibodies"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive panel offers a more complete picture of thyroid function by assessing active hormones (Free T3), potential conversion issues (Reverse T3), and autoimmune involvement (Thyroid Antibodies)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "A patient's lab results show: TSH 2.8 mIU/L, Free T4 1.1 ng/dL, Free T3 2.5 pg/mL, Reverse T3 20 ng/dL (high). Based on this pattern, what might you suspect?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "T3 Resistance", "Impaired T4 to T3 conversion", "Hashimoto's thyroiditis"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Elevated Reverse T3 with otherwise normal TSH, Free T4, and Free T3 suggests the body is favoring rT3 production over T3, potentially due to stress or inflammation, inhibiting the conversion of T4 to T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common pitfall in thyroid lab analysis interpretation?",
            "options": ["Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history", "Using narrow reference ranges", "Relying solely on TSH for diagnosis", "Ordering a comprehensive thyroid panel"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Relying only on TSH can be misleading, as it doesn't capture the full picture of thyroid hormone activity and conversion. Symptoms and a full panel are essential."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her labs show: TSH 5.5 mIU/L (0.4-4.0), Free T4 0.9 ng/dL (0.8-1.8). What is the MOST appropriate initial action?",
            "options": ["Prescribe T3 medication immediately.", "Re-test TSH and Free T4, and add Free T3 and thyroid antibodies.", "Recommend an iodine supplement.", "Advise her to follow a strict ketogenic diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the slightly elevated TSH and symptoms, retesting with a more comprehensive panel (including Free T3 and antibodies) is crucial to rule out subclinical hypothyroidism or autoimmune thyroid disease before starting treatment."

        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "According to a 2023 study discussed in the lesson, what percentage of patients with 'normal' TSH levels still experienced hypothyroid symptoms?",
            "options": ["Less than 5%", "Approximately 10%", "Approximately 15%", "Over 20%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson referenced a 2023 study indicating that approximately 15% of patients with TSH levels within the 'normal' range still reported persistent hypothyroid symptoms, highlighting the importance of considering the full clinical picture."
