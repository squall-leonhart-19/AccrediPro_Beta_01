            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In the GLAND framework, what does the 'N' specifically refer to in the context of Hashimoto's disease?",
            "options": ["Nutrient deficiencies impacting thyroid hormone conversion", "Neurological symptoms associated with thyroid autoimmunity", "Neutralizing antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO)", "Nervous system regulation and its influence on thyroid function"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'N' in the GLAND framework refers to addressing nutrient deficiencies that are critical for optimal thyroid hormone production and conversion, such as selenium, iodine, and zinc."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced thyroid panel markers provides the MOST direct information about the amount of thyroid hormone actively available to tissues?",
            "options": ["Total T4", "Free T4", "Total T3", "Free T3"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Free T3 is the unbound form of T3, meaning it is readily available to enter cells and exert its effects. Therefore, it provides the most direct information about thyroid hormone availability at the tissue level."

            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female with Hashimoto's presents with elevated anti-TPO antibodies despite being on a gluten-free diet for 6 months. What is the MOST appropriate next step in addressing her autoimmune response?",
            "options": ["Increasing her levothyroxine dosage", "Recommending a trial of AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) diet", "Prescribing a low-dose naltrexone (LDN)", "Adding a T3 medication"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While LDN and T3 medication might be considered later, the AIP diet is designed to further reduce inflammation and identify potential food triggers beyond gluten, making it the most appropriate next step."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which of the following adaptogens is BEST suited for an individual with hyperthyroidism experiencing anxiety and insomnia?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Eleuthero", "Lemon Balm"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lemon Balm has calming properties and can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality, making it a suitable adaptogen for individuals with hyperthyroidism experiencing these symptoms. Ashwagandha and Rhodiola are generally not recommended in hyperthyroid conditions."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which environmental toxin is MOST associated with thyroid disruption due to its ability to interfere with iodine uptake?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Perchlorate", "Arsenic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perchlorate is a known thyroid disruptor because it competitively inhibits iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis."

        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In a patient with hypothyroidism, which of the following supplements is MOST directly involved in the conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Selenium", "Iron", "Vitamin D", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a crucial cofactor for the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase, which is responsible for converting T4 (inactive) to T3 (active) thyroid hormone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Based on the Graves' Disease case study, what was a key non-pharmaceutical intervention used to manage the patient's hyperthyroid symptoms?",
            "options": ["High-dose iodine supplementation", "Strict ketogenic diet", "Elimination of cruciferous vegetables", "Stress reduction techniques and gut healing protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Graves' Disease case study emphasized stress reduction techniques (like meditation and yoga) along with a gut-healing protocol to address potential underlying immune triggers and reduce inflammation, which helped manage the hyperthyroid symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A patient with a history of Hashimoto's disease, now euthyroid on medication, reports increased fatigue and brain fog after a stressful life event. What is the MOST important initial step in addressing these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Immediately increasing their thyroid medication dosage", "Ordering a full thyroid panel including antibodies and reverse T3", "Recommending a stimulant medication for fatigue", "Advising complete bed rest"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the history of Hashimoto's and the recent stressor, it's crucial to rule out a flare-up or suboptimal thyroid hormone levels. A full thyroid panel, including antibodies and reverse T3, is the most appropriate initial step."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "What is the estimated percentage of individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease who also experience gastrointestinal issues, highlighting the importance of gut health?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "20-30%", "40-50%", "60-70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 60-70% of individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease also experience gastrointestinal issues, underscoring the strong link between gut health and thyroid autoimmunity. This statistic emphasizes the importance of addressing gut health in these patients."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle factors is MOST likely to exacerbate thyroid autoimmunity due to its impact on systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Regular exercise", "Adequate sleep", "Chronic stress", "Balanced diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress significantly impacts the immune system, leading to increased inflammation and immune dysregulation, which can exacerbate thyroid autoimmunity. While exercise, sleep, and diet are important, chronic stress has a more direct and profound effect on the immune system."
