            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding the relationship between thyroid hormones and cholesterol levels, based on the discussed research?",
            "options": ["Hypothyroidism consistently leads to lower LDL cholesterol.", "Hyperthyroidism consistently leads to elevated HDL cholesterol.", "Optimal thyroid hormone levels are crucial for maintaining healthy cholesterol levels, with both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism potentially contributing to dyslipidemia.", "Thyroid hormones have no significant impact on cholesterol metabolism."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can disrupt cholesterol metabolism, highlighting the importance of optimal thyroid function for healthy cholesterol levels. A 2018 study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism supports this."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her TSH is 6.0 mIU/L (reference range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), and her Free T4 is within the normal range. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Prescribe T3 medication immediately.", "Reassure her that her thyroid is functioning normally since her Free T4 is normal.", "Recommend further testing, including thyroid antibodies (TPOAb and TgAb), and dietary modifications focused on gut health and nutrient optimization.", "Suggest a high-intensity exercise program to combat fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the elevated TSH and symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, further investigation with thyroid antibodies is warranted to assess for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Addressing potential gut health issues and nutrient deficiencies is also a prudent initial step. T3 medication would not be the first course of action."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "According to the module, what percentage of individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have other autoimmune conditions?",
            "options": ["Less than 5%", "Approximately 10-15%", "Around 25-30%", "Greater than 50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The module highlights that approximately 10-15% of individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have other autoimmune conditions, emphasizing the importance of screening for comorbidities."

        {
            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "Which of the following nutrients plays the MOST direct role in the conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin B12"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a crucial component of the enzymes (deiodinases) responsible for converting T4 to the active thyroid hormone T3."

        {
            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client's lab results show elevated TPO antibodies but normal TSH and Free T4 levels. The client reports no noticeable symptoms. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Initiate thyroid hormone replacement therapy immediately.", "Monitor thyroid function regularly (every 6-12 months) and advise the client on lifestyle factors that support thyroid health.", "Prescribe a high dose of iodine to saturate the thyroid gland.", "Recommend a complete thyroidectomy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated TPO antibodies indicate autoimmune activity but normal thyroid function suggests subclinical Hashimoto's. Monitoring and lifestyle interventions are appropriate at this stage."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST reflects the current understanding of the role of gluten in Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
            "options": ["Gluten has no impact on Hashimoto's thyroiditis.", "A gluten-free diet is universally recommended for all individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.", "A gluten-free diet may be beneficial for individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity.", "Gluten is essential for thyroid hormone production."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While not universally required, a gluten-free diet may be beneficial for individuals with Hashimoto's, especially those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, due to potential molecular mimicry and inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "According to the case study presented, which of the following interventions showed the MOST significant improvement in symptoms for the client with Hashimoto's and gut dysbiosis?",
            "options": ["High-dose levothyroxine monotherapy", "Elimination diet, probiotic supplementation, and stress management techniques", "Aggressive exercise regimen", "Iodine supplementation alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study emphasized that a comprehensive approach including addressing gut dysbiosis with an elimination diet and probiotics, along with stress management, yielded the most significant symptom improvement. This highlights the importance of addressing root causes beyond thyroid hormone replacement alone."

        {
            "id": "q11_8",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which chronic stress can negatively impact thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Directly stimulating T4 production.", "Suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and increasing inflammation.", "Enhancing the conversion of T4 to T3.", "Reducing the need for thyroid hormones."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress can suppress the HPT axis, leading to decreased thyroid hormone production, and also contributes to systemic inflammation, which can further impair thyroid function."

        {
            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common symptom of hyperthyroidism that is NOT typically associated with hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Fatigue", "Weight gain", "Heat intolerance", "Constipation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While fatigue, weight gain, and constipation are more commonly associated with hypothyroidism, heat intolerance is a hallmark symptom of hyperthyroidism."

        {
            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A client reports taking a biotin supplement. How should this influence your interpretation of their thyroid lab results?",
            "options": ["Biotin has no impact on thyroid lab results.", "Biotin can falsely elevate TSH levels.", "Biotin can interfere with certain thyroid hormone assays, potentially leading to falsely high or falsely low results for TSH, Free T4, and Free T3.", "Biotin enhances the accuracy of thyroid lab results."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biotin is known to interfere with some thyroid hormone assays, potentially skewing results. It's crucial to ask clients about biotin supplementation before interpreting their thyroid labs and to advise them to discontinue biotin use for several days prior to testing, if possible. The FDA has issued warnings regarding biotin interference with lab tests."
