        {
            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "Which of the following enzymes is primarily responsible for converting T4 to the more active T3 in peripheral tissues?",
            "options": ["Thyroid peroxidase (TPO)", "5'-deiodinase", "Thyroglobulin", "Na+/I- symporter (NIS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "5'-deiodinase enzymes, particularly D2 and D3, are crucial for converting T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. This conversion is essential for thyroid hormone activity at the cellular level."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her lab results show elevated TSH and normal T4. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Graves' Disease", "Subclinical Hypothyroidism", "Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with hyperthyroidism", "Central Hypothyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated TSH with normal T4 indicates subclinical hypothyroidism, where the thyroid is struggling to maintain normal hormone levels, but T4 is still within the reference range. The patient is experiencing hypothyroid symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "In Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, which autoantibody is MOST commonly found?",
            "options": ["Anti-TSH receptor antibody (TRAb)", "Anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb)", "Anti-insulin antibody", "Anti-parietal cell antibody"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anti-thyroglobulin (TgAb) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) antibodies are commonly found in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. While both are present, TPOAb is often more prevalent and considered a key marker."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common symptom of Graves' Disease?",
            "options": ["Weight gain", "Constipation", "Bradycardia", "Exophthalmos"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeballs) is a characteristic symptom of Graves' Disease, caused by inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eyes due to antibody activity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which nutrient is MOST crucial for the conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Vitamin D", "Selenium", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a cofactor for the deiodinase enzymes that convert T4 to T3. Insufficient selenium can impair this conversion, leading to suboptimal thyroid hormone activity. A 2023 meta-analysis highlighted the importance of selenium supplementation in hypothyroid patients."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "According to the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™, what does the 'G' stand for?",
            "options": ["Gut Health", "Genetic Predisposition", "Glucose Metabolism", "Growth Factors"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'G' in the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™ represents Gut Health, emphasizing the critical role of the gut microbiome and intestinal permeability in thyroid health. Gut dysbiosis can exacerbate autoimmune thyroid conditions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "A client presents with a solitary thyroid nodule. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology results are reported as 'Bethesda category IV: follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm.' What is the recommended next step?",
            "options": ["Thyroid hormone suppression therapy", "Radioactive iodine ablation", "Total thyroidectomy", "Surgical lobectomy for histological examination"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A Bethesda category IV result indicates a follicular neoplasm. Surgical lobectomy is typically recommended to obtain a definitive histological diagnosis and rule out follicular thyroid cancer. Total thyroidectomy may be considered based on the final pathology report."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements is MOST likely to interfere with levothyroxine absorption?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Magnesium", "Probiotics", "Omega-3 fatty acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Magnesium can interfere with levothyroxine absorption if taken concurrently. It's generally recommended to separate levothyroxine and magnesium supplementation by at least 4 hours to ensure optimal absorption of the thyroid medication."

            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a 32-year-old client with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis improved significantly after addressing her chronic constipation and implementing a gluten-free diet. This scenario BEST illustrates the importance of which aspect of the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™?",
            "options": ["Lifestyle Factors", "Nutrient Deficiencies", "Adrenal Support", "Gut Health"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "This case study directly highlights the importance of Gut Health in managing Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. Addressing the client's constipation and implementing a gluten-free diet likely improved gut barrier function and reduced systemic inflammation, contributing to improved thyroid function."

        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "When discussing financial considerations with a new client for your thyroid health practice, which of the following is the MOST ethical and transparent approach?",
            "options": ["Offer a 'discounted' package that includes unnecessary services.", "Avoid discussing fees upfront to avoid deterring potential clients.", "Clearly outline all fees, payment options, and cancellation policies in advance.", "Guarantee specific outcomes to justify the cost of the program."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Transparency and clear communication regarding fees, payment options, and cancellation policies are essential for ethical practice. This builds trust and ensures that clients are fully informed before committing to your services. Promising specific outcomes is unethical and unrealistic."
