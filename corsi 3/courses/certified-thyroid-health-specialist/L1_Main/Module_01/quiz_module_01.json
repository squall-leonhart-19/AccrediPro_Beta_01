            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in comprehensive history taking for thyroid health?",
            "options": ["Ordering a complete thyroid panel", "Establishing rapport and trust with the client", "Reviewing the client's previous medical records", "Immediately recommending dietary changes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing rapport and trust is crucial for clients to feel comfortable sharing sensitive information, which is essential for an accurate history. As emphasized in L1, this foundation allows for a more open and honest dialogue."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing persistent fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Which of the following symptom assessment tools would be MOST appropriate to quantify the severity of these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Visual Analog Scale (VAS)", "The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale", "The Epworth Sleepiness Scale", "A general health questionnaire without specific thyroid focus"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) allows the client to rate the intensity of each symptom on a continuous scale, providing a quantifiable measure of their severity. The other options are not specific to thyroid symptoms or their severity. (L2)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "Which pre-existing autoimmune condition is MOST commonly associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
            "options": ["Rheumatoid arthritis", "Type 1 diabetes", "Celiac disease", "Lupus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Celiac disease has a strong association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to shared genetic and immunological pathways. Studies show a significantly higher prevalence of celiac disease in individuals with Hashimoto's. (L3)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A client reports that their mother and sister both have hypothyroidism. This information is MOST relevant to assessing which aspect of their health history?",
            "options": ["Personal medical history", "Lifestyle assessment", "Family history", "Dietary assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A family history of thyroid disorders significantly increases an individual's risk. This highlights the importance of tracing genetic predispositions. (L4)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle factors has the MOST significant impact on thyroid hormone conversion?",
            "options": ["Regular exercise", "Exposure to bright sunlight", "Chronic stress", "Adequate sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress can impair the conversion of T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, potentially exacerbating hypothyroid symptoms. High cortisol levels interfere with the enzyme responsible for T4 to T3 conversion. (L5)"
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "Which dietary component is MOST crucial for the production of thyroid hormones?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Iron", "Iodine", "Selenium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Iodine is an essential component of both T4 and T3 thyroid hormones. Insufficient iodine intake can lead to hypothyroidism. (L6)"

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious due to work-related stress. Which of the following stress assessment tools would be MOST appropriate to evaluate their stress levels?",
            "options": ["Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)", "Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)", "Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)", "Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measures an individual's perception of stress and their ability to cope with it, making it ideal for assessing work-related stress. (L7)"

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism. Her medical history reveals a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis 5 years ago. Her family history is unremarkable for thyroid disorders. She reports a high-stress job and a diet low in iodine-rich foods. Which of the following is the MOST important next step in synthesizing her history?",
            "options": ["Ordering a thyroid ultrasound", "Creating a timeline of symptoms and correlating them with significant life events", "Recommending a gluten-free diet", "Suggesting thyroid hormone replacement therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating a timeline of symptoms and correlating them with significant life events helps identify potential triggers and patterns, providing a comprehensive understanding of the client's condition. (L8)"

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "According to a 2021 study in the 'Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism,' what percentage of individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease also present with at least one other autoimmune condition?",
            "options": ["Approximately 5%", "Approximately 15%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 40%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The study indicated that approximately 25% of individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease also have another autoimmune condition, highlighting the importance of screening for comorbidities. (L3)"

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client mentions they consume a large amount of raw cruciferous vegetables daily. How might this impact their thyroid health, and what specific dietary recommendation is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["It will enhance thyroid hormone production; encourage continued consumption.", "It may inhibit iodine uptake; advise steaming or cooking cruciferous vegetables.", "It will have no impact; dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables is irrelevant.", "It will improve T4 to T3 conversion; advise increasing consumption."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Raw cruciferous vegetables contain goitrogens, which can interfere with iodine uptake and thyroid hormone synthesis. Steaming or cooking these vegetables reduces their goitrogenic effect. (L6)"
