        {
            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "Which of the following thyroid markers provides the MOST comprehensive assessment of thyroid hormone production and conversion?",
            "options": ["TSH", "Free T4", "Free T3", "Reverse T3"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While TSH and Free T4 are important, Free T3 directly reflects the amount of active thyroid hormone available to the cells. Reverse T3 can indicate conversion issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the Nutrient Powerhouses lesson, which nutrient is MOST critical for the conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin D", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a key component of the deiodinase enzymes responsible for converting T4 to the more active T3 hormone."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client presents with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and reports significant bloating and digestive discomfort. Which gut-related factor is MOST likely contributing to their thyroid condition?",
            "options": ["Increased stomach acid production", "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)", "Increased levels of beneficial gut bacteria", "Decreased intestinal permeability"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SIBO can trigger inflammation and immune responses that exacerbate autoimmune thyroid conditions like Hashimoto's."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Chronic stress significantly impacts the thyroid through the HPA axis. Which hormone dysregulation is MOST likely to suppress thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Increased DHEA levels", "Elevated cortisol levels", "Decreased estrogen levels", "Increased testosterone levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol, a stress hormone, can inhibit T4 to T3 conversion and increase Reverse T3, suppressing thyroid function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on environmental toxins, which of the following is considered a PRIMARY endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that can interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Fluoride", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Probiotics"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fluoride, commonly found in water and dental products, can interfere with iodine uptake and thyroid hormone production."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client with hypothyroidism also experiences irregular menstrual cycles and hot flashes. What hormonal imbalance is MOST likely contributing to her symptoms?",
            "options": ["Elevated testosterone", "Estrogen dominance", "Progesterone deficiency", "Low cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone deficiency is common during perimenopause and can exacerbate hypothyroid symptoms, leading to menstrual irregularities and hot flashes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Which dietary approach is MOST appropriate for managing Hashimoto's thyroiditis, based on the advanced dietary strategies discussed?",
            "options": ["High-iodine diet", "Strict ketogenic diet", "Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet", "High-gluten diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Autoimmune Protocol diet focuses on eliminating potential trigger foods to reduce inflammation and autoimmune reactions in conditions like Hashimoto's. A 2019 study showed significant symptom reduction with AIP."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™, what does the 'L' represent, and how does it directly impact thyroid health?",
            "options": ["Liver; detoxification of hormones", "Lymph; immune system regulation", "Lifestyle; stress management", "Lipids; hormone synthesis"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'L' in G.L.A.N.D. represents the Liver. A healthy liver is crucial for the detoxification of hormones, including thyroid hormones, ensuring proper balance and function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated thyroid antibodies (TPO and TgAb) but normal TSH and Free T4. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate as a first-line approach?",
            "options": ["Prescribing thyroid hormone replacement therapy", "Recommending a high-dose iodine supplement", "Implementing stress reduction techniques and gut health support", "Ignoring the antibody levels since TSH is normal"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated antibodies indicate an autoimmune process. Addressing potential triggers like stress and gut dysbiosis is crucial before considering hormone replacement, especially with normal TSH and Free T4. This aligns with the preventative approach emphasized in the course."

        {
            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "Based on the information presented in the module, which of the following statements about the relationship between thyroid health and overall well-being is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["Thyroid hormone levels only affect energy levels and metabolism.", "Optimal thyroid function is independent of other bodily systems.", "Addressing thyroid health can positively impact various aspects of health, including mood, digestion, and hormone balance.", "Thyroid conditions are primarily genetic and not influenced by lifestyle factors."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module emphasizes the interconnectedness of thyroid health with other systems. Addressing thyroid function can have widespread benefits, improving mood, digestion, hormone balance, and overall well-being. This reflects the holistic approach taught in the course."
