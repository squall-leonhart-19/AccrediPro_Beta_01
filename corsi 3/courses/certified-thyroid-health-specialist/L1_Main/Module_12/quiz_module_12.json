            "id": "q12_1",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements, when used in advanced thyroid support, requires careful monitoring of iodine levels due to its potential to exacerbate autoimmune reactions in sensitive individuals?",
            "options": ["Selenium", "Zinc", "L-Tyrosine", "Kelp"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Kelp is a natural source of iodine. While iodine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis, excessive intake can trigger or worsen autoimmune thyroiditis in susceptible individuals, as highlighted in the lesson on advanced supplement strategies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "Beyond TSH, T4, and T3, which of the following lab markers provides the MOST direct information about the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, a crucial aspect of thyroid hormone activity?",
            "options": ["Reverse T3 (rT3)", "Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)", "Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb)", "Free T4 Index (FTI)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 (rT3) is formed from T4 and competes with T3 for receptor sites. Elevated rT3 levels can indicate impaired T4 to T3 conversion, a key topic in advanced lab interpretation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "In a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which nutritional approach has demonstrated the MOST significant reduction in thyroid antibody levels in clinical trials?",
            "options": ["Strict Paleo diet", "Gluten-free diet", "Vegan diet", "High-iodine diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies have shown that a gluten-free diet can significantly reduce thyroid antibody levels (TPOAb and TgAb) in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, likely due to molecular mimicry between gluten and thyroid tissue. This was discussed in the personalized nutrition protocols section."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "Which of the following stress management techniques has been shown to MOST effectively lower cortisol levels and improve thyroid hormone regulation, according to a meta-analysis of studies on thyroid health?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Mindfulness meditation", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "Cold water immersion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation has consistently demonstrated significant reductions in cortisol levels and improvements in thyroid hormone regulation in studies examining the impact of stress on thyroid health. This was a key takeaway from the stress management techniques lesson."

        {
            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "Which of the following detoxification strategies is MOST effective at supporting thyroid function by reducing the burden of environmental toxins that can interfere with thyroid hormone production and receptor binding?",
            "options": ["Juice cleanse", "Coffee enemas", "Infrared sauna therapy", "Chelation therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infrared sauna therapy promotes detoxification through sweat, helping to eliminate heavy metals and other environmental toxins that can disrupt thyroid function. This was highlighted in the advanced detoxification strategies section."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "According to the lesson on the gut-thyroid axis, what percentage of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the gut, highlighting the importance of gut health for optimal thyroid function?",
            "options": ["5%", "20%", "50%", "80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Approximately 20% of T4 to T3 conversion occurs in the gut, emphasizing the crucial role of gut health in thyroid hormone metabolism, as discussed in the lesson on the gut-thyroid axis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which of the following sleep hygiene practices is MOST crucial for optimizing thyroid hormone levels, particularly TSH, during the night?",
            "options": ["Using blue light filters on electronic devices", "Taking a melatonin supplement", "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule", "Drinking chamomile tea before bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake schedule helps regulate the circadian rhythm, which influences TSH secretion. TSH typically peaks at night, and disruptions to sleep can interfere with this pattern, as covered in the sleep optimization lesson."

        {
            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "In the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™, which component focuses on identifying and addressing underlying infections that may be contributing to thyroid dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Gut", "Lifestyle", "Adrenals", "Nutrients"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Gut' component of the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™ emphasizes assessing and addressing gut health, including identifying and treating underlying infections that can contribute to thyroid problems, as demonstrated in the complex case studies."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation despite being on levothyroxine. Her lab results show elevated TPO antibodies and normal TSH. According to the principles discussed in this module, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Increase her levothyroxine dosage", "Evaluate her for nutrient deficiencies (e.g., selenium, zinc)", "Prescribe a T3-only medication", "Advise her to start a rigorous exercise program"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's elevated TPO antibodies and persistent symptoms despite normal TSH, evaluating for nutrient deficiencies, particularly selenium and zinc, which are crucial for thyroid hormone metabolism and immune modulation, is the most appropriate next step. This aligns with the personalized nutrition and advanced supplement strategies discussed in the module."
