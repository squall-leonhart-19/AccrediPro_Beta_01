            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between gut dysbiosis and thyroid autoimmunity, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": ["Gut dysbiosis has no impact on thyroid autoimmunity.", "Gut dysbiosis can trigger molecular mimicry, leading to immune attacks on the thyroid.", "Gut dysbiosis only affects nutrient absorption, not the immune system.", "Gut dysbiosis directly destroys thyroid cells."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gut dysbiosis can lead to increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and the translocation of bacterial antigens. These antigens can resemble thyroid tissue, triggering molecular mimicry and autoimmune attacks on the thyroid."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "According to L2, how does chronic stress primarily affect thyroid hormone conversion?",
            "options": ["It increases the conversion of T4 to T3.", "It decreases the conversion of T4 to T3 and increases the conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3).", "It has no effect on thyroid hormone conversion.", "It directly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more T4."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, which can inhibit the enzyme 5'-deiodinase, responsible for converting T4 to the active T3. This leads to an increase in inactive rT3 and a decrease in available T3."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "A patient presents with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and reports fatigue, constipation, and hair loss. According to L3, which nutrient deficiency is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Calcium", "Selenium", "Potassium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is crucial for the production of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that protects the thyroid gland from oxidative damage. Deficiency is common in Hashimoto's and can exacerbate symptoms like fatigue, constipation, and hair loss. Studies show supplementation can reduce TPOAb levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "Which environmental toxin, discussed in L4, is known to competitively inhibit iodine uptake in the thyroid gland?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Fluoride", "Arsenic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fluoride is a halogen that can competitively inhibit iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, potentially leading to hypothyroidism. Other halogens like chlorine and bromine can also interfere with thyroid function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of thyroid hormone resistance, as discussed in L5?",
            "options": ["Elevated TSH and low free T4", "Low TSH and elevated free T4 and free T3, but persistent hypothyroid symptoms", "Normal TSH, free T4, and free T3 with resolution of all hypothyroid symptoms", "Elevated TSH, normal free T4 and free T3 with no hypothyroid symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormone resistance is characterized by the body's cells being less responsive to thyroid hormone, despite normal or elevated levels of free T4 and free T3. This results in persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite seemingly normal lab results."

        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™ (L6), what does the 'G' represent?",
            "options": ["Genetic Predisposition", "Gut Health", "Glucose Metabolism", "Glandular Support"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the G.L.A.N.D. Framework™, 'G' represents Gut Health, emphasizing the critical role of the gut microbiome and intestinal permeability in thyroid health, especially in autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Beyond TSH, T4, and T3, which of the following advanced thyroid markers, discussed in L7, provides insight into the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb)", "Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)", "Reverse T3 (rT3)", "Thyroglobulin"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reverse T3 (rT3) is an inactive form of T3. Elevated rT3 levels, especially in relation to free T3, can indicate impaired peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, often due to stress, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "Which functional medicine principle, discussed in L8, is MOST relevant when addressing the root cause of a patient's hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Treating symptoms with medication", "Focusing solely on thyroid hormone replacement", "Investigating and addressing underlying imbalances in the body", "Ignoring the patient's lifestyle and environmental factors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A core principle of functional medicine is to identify and address the root causes of illness, rather than simply treating symptoms. This involves investigating underlying imbalances, such as gut dysbiosis, nutrient deficiencies, and environmental toxin exposure."

        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, 'Jane Doe', presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her TSH is within the 'normal' range (2.5 mIU/L), but she continues to experience symptoms. Based on L7 and L8, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Increase her carbohydrate intake.", "Prescribe a higher dose of thyroid hormone.", "Run a complete thyroid panel including free T3, free T4, reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies, and assess for other contributing factors.", "Tell her that her symptoms are likely unrelated to her thyroid."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even with a 'normal' TSH, persistent symptoms warrant a more comprehensive thyroid panel to evaluate free T3, free T4, reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies. Additionally, it's important to assess for other contributing factors, such as nutrient deficiencies, adrenal dysfunction, and gut health issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "According to L1, L3 and L4, which combination of strategies would be MOST effective in supporting thyroid health by addressing gut health, nutrient deficiencies, and toxin exposure?",
            "options": ["A gluten-free diet, selenium supplementation, and avoidance of processed foods.", "A high-fiber diet, iron supplementation, and regular exercise.", "A ketogenic diet, zinc supplementation, and exposure to sunlight.", "A dairy-free diet, vitamin D supplementation, and use of plastic food containers."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A gluten-free diet can reduce inflammation and gut permeability in susceptible individuals, selenium supplementation supports thyroid hormone production and protects against oxidative stress, and avoiding processed foods reduces exposure to toxins and inflammatory compounds that can negatively impact thyroid function."
