            "id": "q10_1",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements has shown the MOST consistent evidence for improving T4 to T3 conversion in individuals with hypothyroidism, assuming adequate selenium levels are already present?",
            "options": ["Zinc", "Iron", "Vitamin D", "NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Zinc is a crucial cofactor for the enzyme deiodinase, which converts T4 to T3. While other nutrients are important for thyroid health, zinc has the most direct impact on this conversion process, provided selenium is sufficient."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite TSH within the reference range and normal T4/T3 levels. Further testing reveals elevated Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb). Which nutritional strategy is MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Strict ketogenic diet", "Gluten-free diet", "High-iodine supplementation", "Intermittent fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the elevated TPOAb, the client likely has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A gluten-free diet is often recommended as molecular mimicry between gluten and thyroid tissue may exacerbate the autoimmune response. A 2019 study by Krysiak et al. found that a gluten-free diet significantly reduced TPOAb levels."

            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "Which of the following stress management techniques has demonstrated the GREATEST effect size in reducing cortisol levels and improving thyroid hormone levels in individuals with chronic stress and hypothyroidism, according to meta-analyses?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation", "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)", "Deep breathing exercises", "Yoga"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "MBSR has consistently shown significant reductions in cortisol and improvements in thyroid hormone levels in stressed individuals. A meta-analysis by Grossman et al. (2004) found a moderate to large effect size for MBSR in reducing stress and anxiety."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In the case study of Sarah, a 38-year-old with complex hypothyroid presentation, what was the PRIMARY environmental toxin suspected of contributing to her thyroid dysfunction, based on her history and lab results?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Bisphenol A (BPA)", "Perchlorate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah's case study highlighted the potential impact of BPA, a common endocrine disruptor found in plastics. Her elevated urinary BPA levels, combined with her symptoms, suggested a strong correlation."

        {
            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of 'Thyroid Hormone Resistance'?",
            "options": ["The thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient thyroid hormone.", "The body's cells are unable to properly respond to thyroid hormone despite adequate levels.", "The immune system attacks the thyroid gland, preventing hormone production.", "Excessive thyroid hormone is produced, leading to hyperthyroidism."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid Hormone Resistance (THR) is characterized by a reduced responsiveness of target tissues to thyroid hormones, even when thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range. This leads to cellular hypothyroidism despite seemingly normal lab results."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "According to the G.L.A.N.D. framework, which element focuses on identifying and addressing underlying infections that may be contributing to thyroid dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Gut Health", "Lifestyle Factors", "Adrenal Support", "Nutrition"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Gut Health' component of the G.L.A.N.D. framework specifically addresses the role of gut dysbiosis and infections (e.g., SIBO, parasites) in thyroid health. These imbalances can trigger inflammation and impair thyroid hormone conversion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "A client's thyroid antibody testing reveals significantly elevated levels of both TPOAb and TgAb. What does this combination MOST strongly suggest?",
            "options": ["Graves' disease", "Subacute thyroiditis", "Hashimoto's thyroiditis", "Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated levels of both TPOAb and TgAb are highly indicative of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary recommendations is LEAST likely to be beneficial for managing autoimmune thyroid disease?",
            "options": ["Prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods", "Ensuring adequate selenium intake", "Following a strict paleo diet with high red meat consumption", "Optimizing vitamin D levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While a paleo diet can be beneficial for some, high consumption of red meat may exacerbate inflammation in certain individuals with autoimmune conditions. Prioritizing plant-based protein sources and anti-inflammatory foods is generally more beneficial."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY mechanism by which perchlorate, a common environmental contaminant, disrupts thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Blocking T4 to T3 conversion", "Interfering with the sodium-iodide symporter", "Directly damaging thyroid cells", "Increasing thyroid hormone receptor sensitivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Perchlorate inhibits thyroid function by competitively inhibiting the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS), which is responsible for transporting iodide into thyroid follicular cells. This reduces iodide uptake and impairs thyroid hormone synthesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism, normal TSH, T4, and T3 levels, but consistently low body temperature and fatigue. Which of the following tests would be MOST helpful in further assessing potential cellular hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Reverse T3 (rT3)", "Thyroid antibodies (TPOAb, TgAb)", "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) assessment", "Complete Blood Count (CBC)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While rT3 and thyroid antibodies can provide useful information, a BMR assessment can help determine if the client's cells are utilizing thyroid hormone effectively. Low body temperature and fatigue, despite normal thyroid hormone levels, suggest potential cellular hypothyroidism, which a BMR test can help to identify."
