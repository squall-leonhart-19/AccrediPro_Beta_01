        {
            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following liver enzymes is MOST directly involved in the conversion of T4 to T3?",
            "options": ["Alanine transaminase (ALT)", "Aspartate transaminase (AST)", "5'-deiodinase", "Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "5'-deiodinase enzymes, particularly type 1 (D1) found in the liver, are responsible for the majority of peripheral T4 to T3 conversion. ALT, AST, and GGT are indicators of liver health but do not directly participate in thyroid hormone conversion."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated reverse T3 (rT3) and normal TSH, T4, and T3. Based on the lesson, which of the following is the MOST likely contributing factor?",
            "options": ["Selenium deficiency", "Iron overload", "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol", "Excessive iodine intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels can increase the activity of the enzyme that converts T4 to rT3, leading to elevated rT3 levels. Selenium deficiency can impair T4 to T3 conversion, iron overload is less directly related, and excessive iodine intake typically affects TSH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "According to research cited in the selenium lesson, what percentage of the population is estimated to have suboptimal selenium levels?",
            "options": ["Less than 5%", "Approximately 10-15%", "Between 20-30%", "Over 50%"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While geographically variable, several studies suggest that less than 5% of the population is truly selenium deficient, but many individuals may have suboptimal levels that affect thyroid function. It is important to test and not just assume deficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which form of iron is generally MOST bioavailable and effective for improving iron stores in individuals with hypothyroidism and iron deficiency anemia?",
            "options": ["Ferrous sulfate", "Ferric citrate", "Ferrous bisglycinate", "Ferric chloride"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ferrous bisglycinate is generally better tolerated and absorbed compared to ferrous sulfate. Ferric citrate and chloride have lower bioavailability. The key is to increase iron levels without causing digestive upset."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis reports feeling 'wired' and anxious after starting thyroid hormone replacement. Which adrenal hormone imbalance is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Elevated DHEA-S", "Low cortisol", "Elevated cortisol", "Normal cortisol levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated cortisol, particularly in the context of initiating thyroid hormone replacement, can exacerbate anxiety and hyperthyroid symptoms. The adrenal-thyroid axis interplay highlights that cortisol dysregulation can significantly impact how someone responds to thyroid medication."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which of the following environmental toxins is MOST strongly associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer and autoimmune thyroid disease?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Perchlorate", "Bisphenol A (BPA)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perchlorate, a common contaminant in drinking water, interferes with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer and autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's. While other toxins are harmful, perchlorate has the most direct impact on thyroid function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A client with Graves' disease is considering natural interventions to modulate their immune system. Which of the following supplements has the strongest evidence for reducing thyroid antibody levels in Graves' disease?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Selenium", "Curcumin", "Probiotics"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium supplementation has demonstrated efficacy in reducing thyroid antibody levels (specifically anti-TSHR antibodies) in individuals with Graves' disease. While other supplements may have immunomodulatory effects, selenium has the most robust evidence in this context."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "A client on T4-only medication still experiences fatigue and brain fog despite a 'normal' TSH. What is the MOST appropriate next step to consider, according to the module?",
            "options": ["Increasing the T4 dosage significantly", "Adding T3 medication to the treatment regimen", "Prescribing an antidepressant", "Recommending a low-iodine diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the client's persistent symptoms despite a 'normal' TSH on T4-only medication, adding T3 medication to the regimen is a logical next step. Some individuals do not convert T4 to T3 effectively, and a combination therapy may be beneficial."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced thyroid markers provides the MOST direct assessment of thyroid hormone action at the cellular level?",
            "options": ["Free T4 (FT4)", "Free T3 (FT3)", "Reverse T3 (rT3)", "Thyroid hormone resistance test"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While FT4, FT3, and rT3 provide information about thyroid hormone levels in the blood, a thyroid hormone resistance test assesses how well thyroid hormones are actually working at the cellular level. This is crucial for understanding if the body is responding appropriately to the available hormones."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "Using the GLAND framework, a client presents with persistent fatigue, weight gain, and constipation despite optimal thyroid hormone levels. Which of the following areas should be investigated FIRST?",
            "options": ["Liver function", "Gut health", "Adrenal function", "Nutrient deficiencies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Following the GLAND framework (Gut, Liver, Adrenals, Nutrients, Detoxification), gut health is prioritized due to its significant impact on nutrient absorption, immune function, and overall well-being. Addressing gut dysbiosis can often improve thyroid hormone utilization and alleviate symptoms."
