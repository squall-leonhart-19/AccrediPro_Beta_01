            "id": "q9_1",
            "question": "Which enzyme is primarily responsible for the conversion of T4 to the more active T3 in peripheral tissues?",
            "options": ["Thyroid peroxidase (TPO)", "5'-deiodinase", "Thyroglobulin", "Sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "5'-deiodinase enzymes, particularly D2 and D3, are critical for converting T4 to T3 or reverse T3 (rT3) in various tissues. TPO is involved in thyroid hormone synthesis within the thyroid gland."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Her TSH is 6.2 mIU/L (reference range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), and her free T4 is within the normal range. According to current guidelines, what is the MOST appropriate initial approach?",
            "options": ["Initiate levothyroxine treatment immediately.", "Repeat TSH and free T4 in 6-8 weeks, monitoring for symptom progression.", "Order thyroid antibody testing (TPOAb, TgAb) to assess for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.", "Prescribe a trial of T3-only medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the elevated TSH and normal free T4, subclinical hypothyroidism is suspected. Thyroid antibody testing is crucial to determine if Hashimoto's is the underlying cause. Repeat testing is also reasonable, but antibody assessment provides valuable diagnostic information early on."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the role of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in mediating thyroid hormone action at the cellular level?",
            "options": ["TRs are located exclusively in the cytoplasm and initiate signaling cascades upon T3 binding.", "TRs are nuclear receptors that bind to specific DNA sequences (TREs) to regulate gene transcription.", "TRs directly activate ribosomes to increase protein synthesis.", "TRs primarily influence cellular metabolism by altering mitochondrial membrane permeability."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are nuclear receptors that, upon binding T3, interact with thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) on DNA to modulate gene transcription. This is the primary mechanism of thyroid hormone action."

        {
            "id": "q9_4",
            "question": "In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which of the following autoantibodies is MOST commonly elevated?",
            "options": ["Anti-TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb)", "Thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb)", "Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies", "Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While both TgAb and TPOAb are commonly elevated in Hashimoto's, TPOAb is often found at higher levels and is more frequently positive. TRAb is associated with Graves' disease."

            "id": "q9_5",
            "question": "A 32-year-old pregnant woman is diagnosed with Graves' disease. Which of the following antithyroid medications is GENERALLY considered the safest option during the first trimester?",
            "options": ["Methimazole", "Propylthiouracil (PTU)", "Radioactive iodine (RAI)", "Potassium iodide (SSKI)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PTU is generally preferred over methimazole during the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of embryopathy associated with methimazole. RAI is contraindicated in pregnancy."

        {
            "id": "q9_6",
            "question": "According to the G.L.A.N.D. framework, what does the acronym 'N' stand for?",
            "options": ["Nutrition", "Nervous System", "Neurotransmitters", "New Habits"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the G.L.A.N.D. framework, 'N' represents the Nervous System, emphasizing the importance of addressing stress and nervous system dysregulation in thyroid health."

            "id": "q9_7",
            "question": "A thyroid nodule is classified as TIRADS 5. What does this classification suggest?",
            "options": ["Benign nodule", "Low suspicion for malignancy", "Intermediate suspicion for malignancy", "High suspicion for malignancy"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "TIRADS 5 indicates a high suspicion for malignancy (≥65-90% risk) based on ultrasound characteristics, warranting fine needle aspiration (FNA)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q9_8",
            "question": "Which of the following hormones is MOST directly involved in the feedback loop regulating thyroid hormone production?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)", "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)", "Growth hormone (GH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "TSH, produced by the pituitary gland, directly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T4 and T3. Elevated T4 and T3 levels inhibit TSH release, creating a negative feedback loop."

        {
            "id": "q9_9",
            "question": "Research suggests that individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease may have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune conditions. Which of the following is a commonly associated autoimmune disorder?",
            "options": ["Type 2 Diabetes", "Osteoarthritis", "Rheumatoid arthritis", "Gout"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a commonly associated autoimmune condition with autoimmune thyroid diseases like Hashimoto's and Graves'. The shared autoimmune mechanisms contribute to this increased risk."

        {
            "id": "q9_10",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism, but lab tests reveal normal TSH and free T4 levels. Further investigation reveals elevated levels of reverse T3 (rT3). Which of the following factors is MOST likely contributing to this elevated rT3?",
            "options": ["Excessive iodine intake", "Selenium deficiency", "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol", "Overconsumption of cruciferous vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels can increase the conversion of T4 to rT3, an inactive form of thyroid hormone, leading to a relative thyroid hormone deficiency despite normal TSH and free T4."
