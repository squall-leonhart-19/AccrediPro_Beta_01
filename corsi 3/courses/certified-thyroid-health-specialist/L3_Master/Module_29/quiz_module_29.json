            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary goal of the Advanced G.L.A.N.D. Framework when applied to complex thyroid cases?",
            "options": ["To solely focus on gut health and its direct impact on T4 to T3 conversion.", "To identify and address the interconnectedness of various body systems impacting thyroid function.", "To prescribe a standardized protocol of supplements and dietary changes for all thyroid patients.", "To rapidly increase T4 levels through medication, regardless of underlying causes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "question": "A client's lab results reveal elevated TSH, low Free T4, normal Free T3, and elevated Reverse T3. Based on the 'Decoding Complex Lab Panels' lesson, what is the MOST likely interpretation?",
            "options": ["The client is experiencing hyperthyroidism with T3 toxicosis.", "The client has adequate T4 production but impaired T4 to T3 conversion, possibly due to stress or inflammation.", "The client's thyroid gland is functioning optimally, and the lab results are within normal ranges.", "The client has severe iodine deficiency, requiring immediate supplementation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated Reverse T3 indicates that the body is converting T4 into the inactive Reverse T3 form instead of the active T3, which can be triggered by stress, inflammation, or nutrient deficiencies."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "Which nutritional strategy is MOST likely to benefit a client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and confirmed gluten sensitivity, as discussed in the 'Personalized Nutrition Strategies for Thyroid Health' lesson?",
            "options": ["A high-iodine diet with regular consumption of seaweed and iodized salt.", "A strict gluten-free diet combined with anti-inflammatory foods and targeted nutrient support.", "A ketogenic diet with high fat intake to reduce inflammation.", "A high-carbohydrate diet focused on complex carbohydrates for energy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gluten sensitivity is common in Hashimoto's patients, and a gluten-free diet can significantly reduce inflammation and improve thyroid function. Combining this with anti-inflammatory foods and targeted nutrients provides comprehensive support."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "According to the 'Targeted Supplementation Protocols' lesson, which supplement is MOST likely to support T4 to T3 conversion in a client with selenium deficiency?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Vitamin D", "Selenium", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a crucial cofactor for the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase, which is responsible for converting T4 to T3. Supplementation can improve conversion in deficient individuals."

            "id": "q29_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing significant stress and difficulty sleeping, which is negatively impacting their thyroid function. Which lifestyle modification, as discussed in 'Advanced Lifestyle Modifications for Thyroid Optimization', is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) every day.", "Implementing a consistent sleep schedule, practicing stress-reduction techniques like meditation, and optimizing light exposure.", "Intermittent fasting with a 16-hour eating window.", "Consuming caffeine throughout the day to combat fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress and sleep deprivation can significantly impair thyroid function. Prioritizing sleep, managing stress, and optimizing light exposure are crucial for thyroid health."

            "question": "In the 'Navigating Complex Client Communication' lesson, what is the MOST effective approach when a client expresses skepticism about the recommended dietary changes?",
            "options": ["Dismissing their concerns and insisting on strict adherence to the plan.", "Providing scientific evidence and explaining the rationale behind the recommendations in a clear and empathetic manner.", "Immediately recommending medication instead of dietary changes.", "Blaming the client for their lack of progress if they don't follow the plan."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective communication involves understanding the client's concerns, providing evidence-based explanations, and fostering a collaborative approach to treatment."

            "question": "In a case study presented in 'Advanced Case Study Analysis & Synthesis', a 45-year-old female with Hashimoto's experienced improved thyroid antibody levels and reduced fatigue after implementing a gluten-free diet and supplementing with selenium and Vitamin D. What key takeaway does this case study illustrate?",
            "options": ["Hashimoto's is easily curable with dietary changes and supplementation alone.", "Addressing underlying factors like gluten sensitivity and nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact Hashimoto's symptoms and thyroid function.", "Medication is always necessary for managing Hashimoto's, regardless of lifestyle interventions.", "Vitamin D supplementation is the primary treatment for Hashimoto's."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This case study demonstrates the power of addressing underlying factors in managing Hashimoto's, highlighting the importance of personalized interventions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An integrated approach emphasizes looking beyond TSH and Free T4 to identify underlying factors that may be contributing to thyroid symptoms, even with 'normal' lab results."
