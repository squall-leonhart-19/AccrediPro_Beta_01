            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "In structuring effective supervision sessions, what is the recommended initial step to ensure a productive and focused discussion?",
            "options": ["Reviewing client files immediately", "Establishing a clear agenda and objectives for the session", "Sharing personal experiences related to thyroid health", "Administering a knowledge-based quiz"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Setting a clear agenda at the beginning of the session helps both the supervisor and supervisee stay on track and ensures that the most important topics are addressed. This establishes a framework for focused discussion and efficient use of time."

            "question": "A supervisee consistently struggles with accurately interpreting thyroid lab results. Which type of feedback is MOST constructive in this scenario?",
            "options": ["'You're not good at reading labs.'", "'Try harder next time.'", "'Let's review the lab results together, focusing on reference ranges and potential interpretations. We can also explore additional resources for understanding lab analysis.'", "'Just ask someone else to interpret them for you.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Constructive feedback is specific, actionable, and focused on behavior rather than personal traits. Offering a collaborative review of lab results and suggesting additional resources provides the supervisee with the tools and support needed to improve their skills, and aligns with principles of effective feedback discussed in the lessons."
