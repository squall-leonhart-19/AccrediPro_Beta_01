            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention for a 32-year-old female with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, TSH of 6.0 mIU/L, and positive anti-TPO antibodies, who is planning to conceive in the next 6 months?",
            "options": ["Initiate levothyroxine to achieve a TSH level below 2.5 mIU/L.", "Recommend a strict gluten-free diet and monitor TSH levels monthly.", "Prescribe selenium supplementation at 200 mcg daily and retest thyroid antibodies in 3 months.", "Advise on stress reduction techniques and monitor TSH levels every 6 months."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "For women planning pregnancy, maintaining a TSH level below 2.5 mIU/L is crucial to support healthy fetal development and reduce the risk of complications, as discussed in the lesson on thyroid dysfunction and fertility."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 68-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease presents with new-onset atrial fibrillation. His TSH is currently suppressed at 0.1 mIU/L. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Increase his levothyroxine dosage to normalize TSH levels.", "Maintain the current levothyroxine dosage as long as he is asymptomatic.", "Decrease his levothyroxine dosage and monitor for symptom recurrence.", "Immediately discontinue levothyroxine due to the risk of further cardiac complications."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Suppressed TSH in older adults with cardiovascular disease can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Reducing the levothyroxine dosage is necessary while monitoring for symptom recurrence of hypothyroidism, as emphasized in the lesson on thyroid disorders and cardiovascular health."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "According to studies discussed in the lesson on neurological function, which cognitive domain is MOST commonly affected in individuals with untreated or poorly managed hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Verbal fluency", "Working memory", "Spatial reasoning", "Executive function"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Working memory is frequently impaired in individuals with hypothyroidism due to its sensitivity to thyroid hormone fluctuations, as highlighted in the lesson on thyroid health and neurological function."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A 12-year-old patient is diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and presents with symptoms of fatigue, constipation, and difficulty concentrating in school. Her TSH is 7.0 mIU/L. What is the FIRST-LINE treatment?",
            "options": ["Administer T3 (liothyronine) monotherapy.", "Initiate levothyroxine at a weight-based dosage and monitor TSH levels.", "Recommend dietary changes, including iodine supplementation.", "Prescribe a combination of T4 and T3 to improve symptom resolution."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In pediatric cases of Hashimoto's with elevated TSH, the first-line treatment involves levothyroxine at a weight-based dosage to normalize thyroid hormone levels, as discussed in the lesson on pediatric thyroid disorders."

        {
            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "Which of the following laboratory markers is MOST indicative of autoimmune thyroid disease, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",
            "options": ["Elevated free T3", "Elevated TSH with normal free T4", "Positive anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies", "Low reverse T3 (rT3)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The presence of positive anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies strongly suggests autoimmune thyroiditis, such as Hashimoto's, as detailed in the lesson on advanced lab interpretation."

        {
            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A 55-year-old woman, post-thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer, is on suppressive levothyroxine therapy. Her thyroglobulin level is undetectable, but her anti-thyroglobulin antibody level is elevated. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The patient is likely cured of thyroid cancer.", "The elevated antibodies may interfere with the accuracy of the thyroglobulin measurement.", "The patient is experiencing levothyroxine overtreatment.", "The patient has developed a new autoimmune disorder."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated anti-thyroglobulin antibodies can interfere with the accurate measurement of thyroglobulin, making it difficult to rely on thyroglobulin levels for monitoring cancer recurrence. This is discussed in the thyroid cancer lesson."
        },
        {
            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements has shown promise in supporting thyroid health by reducing thyroid antibody levels, particularly in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, according to research discussed in the autoimmune conditions lesson?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Selenium", "Iron", "Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium supplementation has been shown in some studies to help reduce thyroid antibody levels in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This was covered in the lesson on thyroid health and autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "A 75-year-old patient with a history of hypothyroidism reports experiencing increased fatigue, weight gain, and constipation despite being on a stable dose of levothyroxine for several years. Her TSH is within the normal range. What should be the NEXT step in evaluating this patient?",
            "options": ["Increase the levothyroxine dosage to alleviate symptoms.", "Assess for nutrient deficiencies, such as iron and vitamin D.", "Prescribe a trial of T3 (liothyronine) to improve symptom resolution.", "Recommend a high-intensity exercise program to combat fatigue."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In older adults on stable levothyroxine doses, new or worsening symptoms despite normal TSH may indicate nutrient deficiencies that can impair thyroid hormone function. Assessing for iron and vitamin D deficiencies is an appropriate next step. The aging thyroid lesson covers this."

            "options": ["Tachycardia", "Hypertension", "Increased left ventricular ejection fraction", "Bradycardia"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Bradycardia (slow heart rate) is a common cardiovascular manifestation of hypothyroidism. Untreated or poorly managed hypothyroidism can lead to a decrease in heart rate, as discussed in the lesson on thyroid disorders and cardiovascular health."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A 35-year-old pregnant woman with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is found to have a TSH of 3.5 mIU/L at 8 weeks gestation. Her levothyroxine dosage is 100 mcg daily. What is the MOST appropriate adjustment to her levothyroxine dosage?",
            "options": ["Decrease the levothyroxine dosage by 25 mcg daily.", "Maintain the current levothyroxine dosage.", "Increase the levothyroxine dosage by 25-50 mcg daily.", "Discontinue levothyroxine due to potential risks to the fetus."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During pregnancy, women with hypothyroidism often require an increase in levothyroxine dosage, typically by 25-50 mcg daily, to maintain a TSH level within the optimal range (ideally <2.5 mIU/L) for fetal development. This is covered in the lesson on thyroid dysfunction and fertility."
