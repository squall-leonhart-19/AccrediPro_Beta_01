            "id": "q28_1",
            "question": "A 35-year-old female presents with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status post-thyroidectomy. Which of the following is the MOST likely initial diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Myxedema Coma", "Thyroid Storm", "Adrenal Crisis", "Postpartum Thyroiditis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Thyroid storm is characterized by fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, often triggered by surgery or infection. Myxedema coma presents with hypothermia and bradycardia."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "What is the primary goal in managing airway obstruction caused by thyroid cancer?",
            "options": ["Administering intravenous corticosteroids", "Performing an emergency tracheostomy", "Initiating radioactive iodine therapy", "Prescribing high-dose levothyroxine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emergency tracheostomy is the primary intervention to relieve airway obstruction. While corticosteroids can reduce inflammation, they are not a definitive solution for immediate obstruction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A pregnant woman with Graves' disease presents with hypertension and seizures at 32 weeks gestation. Which condition is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Postpartum Thyroiditis", "Eclampsia", "Myxedema Coma", "Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hypertension and seizures during pregnancy are indicative of eclampsia. While thyroid dysfunction can complicate pregnancy, eclampsia is a distinct condition requiring immediate management."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "Which medication is MOST commonly associated with drug-induced hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Methimazole", "Propylthiouracil (PTU)", "Amiodarone", "Levothyroxine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Amiodarone is known to cause both hyper- and hypothyroidism due to its high iodine content and effects on thyroid hormone metabolism. It has been reported to cause thyroid dysfunction in up to 20% of patients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is admitted with profound weakness, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. What is the MOST likely underlying cause?",
            "options": ["Thyroid Storm", "Adrenal Crisis", "Hypercalcemia", "Lithium Toxicity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The combination of weakness, hypotension, and hypoglycemia in a patient with Hashimoto's suggests adrenal crisis, often linked to autoimmune adrenal insufficiency. It is estimated that 10-20% of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease also develop adrenal insufficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "According to the G.L.A.N.D. framework, what does the 'N' represent in the context of integrative thyroid care?",
            "options": ["Nutrient Optimization", "Nerve Function", "Neutralizing Antibodies", "Nodular Assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the G.L.A.N.D. framework, 'N' stands for Nutrient Optimization, focusing on identifying and addressing nutrient deficiencies that impact thyroid function. The framework emphasizes a holistic approach to thyroid health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A patient in myxedema coma is being mechanically ventilated. Which of the following parameters requires the MOST careful monitoring?",
            "options": ["Blood Glucose Levels", "Serum Calcium Levels", "Arterial Blood Gases (ABGs)", "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) Levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In myxedema coma, respiratory function is severely compromised. Monitoring ABGs is crucial to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Hypoventilation is a major concern."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "What is the ethical principle MOST directly violated when a physician withholds potentially life-saving thyroid hormone replacement from a patient based solely on personal beliefs?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Justice", "Non-maleficence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Beneficence, the principle of acting in the patient's best interest, is violated when a physician withholds necessary treatment based on personal beliefs, especially when it could save the patient's life."
        },
        {
            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A patient undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer develops severe hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Administering bisphosphonates", "Initiating calcitonin therapy", "Performing a parathyroidectomy", "Aggressive intravenous hydration with normal saline"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Aggressive intravenous hydration with normal saline is the initial step to dilute serum calcium and promote renal excretion. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used later to reduce bone resorption, but hydration is the immediate priority."

        {
            "id": "q28_10",
            "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of lithium use for bipolar disorder presents with constipation, fatigue, and cognitive slowing. TSH is elevated. What is the MOST likely cause?",
            "options": ["Thyroid Storm", "Lithium-Induced Hypothyroidism", "Adrenal Crisis", "Hypercalcemia"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lithium is known to interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis and can cause hypothyroidism. The symptoms (constipation, fatigue, cognitive slowing) and elevated TSH in a patient with a history of lithium use strongly suggest lithium-induced hypothyroidism. Studies show that up to 50% of patients on long-term lithium therapy develop thyroid abnormalities."
