            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client presents with elevated TSH, low free T4, and normal T3. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "Subclinical Hyperthyroidism", "Hypothyroidism", "Subclinical Hypothyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated TSH and low free T4 are indicative of hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough thyroid hormone. Normal T3 can occur in early stages or with T4-to-T3 conversion issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "Which nutrient is ESSENTIAL for the conversion of T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone?",
