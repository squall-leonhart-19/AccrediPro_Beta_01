            "question": "Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST appropriate for a senior cat experiencing age-related decline in kidney function?",
            "options": ["Increased protein intake to maintain muscle mass.", "Decreased phosphorus intake to reduce kidney workload.", "Supplementation with taurine to support cardiac function.", "Increased fiber intake to prevent constipation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Decreasing phosphorus intake is crucial for managing kidney disease in senior cats, as it reduces the workload on the kidneys and helps slow the progression of the disease. While the other options have benefits, they are not the primary dietary focus for kidney disease management."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A cat is exhibiting piloerection, hissing, and flattened ears. According to the feline communication signals discussed, what is the MOST likely emotional state of the cat?",
            "options": ["Playfulness", "Fear and Aggression", "Relaxation", "Affection"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Piloerection (raised fur), hissing, and flattened ears are classic signs of a cat experiencing fear and aggression. These behaviors are defensive mechanisms to ward off perceived threats."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which of the following environmental enrichment strategies is MOST effective in reducing inter-cat aggression in a multi-cat household?",
            "options": ["Providing a single, large litter box for all cats.", "Increasing vertical space and providing multiple perches.", "Feeding all cats from a single, shared food bowl.", "Using synthetic feline pheromones in a limited area."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Increasing vertical space and providing multiple perches allows cats to establish their own territories and avoid direct confrontation, reducing competition and aggression. Multiple resources are key to multi-cat harmony."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "What is the FIRST step you should take when encountering a cat exhibiting signs of severe respiratory distress, such as open-mouth breathing and blue-tinged gums?",
            "options": ["Administering oxygen via a mask or nasal cannula.", "Performing the Heimlich maneuver.", "Immediately transporting the cat to a veterinary hospital.", "Providing a quiet, stress-free environment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In cases of severe respiratory distress, immediate transport to a veterinary hospital is critical. While oxygen administration and creating a stress-free environment are important, they should be done en route to or at the veterinary facility. The cat needs immediate professional intervention."

            "question": "Client Mittens, a 14-year-old cat, has lost weight, is drinking excessively, and has increased urination. Based on the senior cat wellness lesson, which condition is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "Feline Cognitive Dysfunction", "Osteoarthritis", "Dental Disease"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Weight loss, excessive drinking (polydipsia), and increased urination (polyuria) are classic signs of hyperthyroidism in senior cats. While the other conditions are also common in older cats, they don't typically present with this specific combination of symptoms."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which of the following zoonotic diseases is MOST commonly transmitted to humans through cat scratches or bites?",

            "question": "A cat owner reports that their cat has been diagnosed with Tritrichomonas foetus. What dietary change is MOST recommended to manage this condition?",
            "options": ["Feeding a high-fiber diet.", "Feeding a grain-free diet.", "Feeding a highly digestible protein diet.", "Feeding a raw food diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A highly digestible protein diet is recommended for cats with Tritrichomonas foetus because it reduces the amount of undigested material in the colon, which can exacerbate the infection. High fiber diets can worsen the condition."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2021 study in the 'Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery' indicated that approximately 90% of cats over the age of 12 years have radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. This highlights the high prevalence of this condition in senior cats."

            "question": "In a case study, a cat named Whiskers was displaying inappropriate elimination outside the litter box. After ruling out medical causes, what was the MOST effective intervention based on the PURRS framework?",
            "options": ["Punishing the cat for eliminating outside the litter box.", "Adding an additional litter box in a different location and using a different type of litter.", "Restricting the cat's access to certain areas of the house.", "Ignoring the behavior in hopes that it will resolve on its own."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adding an additional litter box in a different location and using a different type of litter addresses the 'Safe Environment' and 'Understanding' components of the PURRS framework. Cats are often particular about their litter box preferences, and providing more options can resolve inappropriate elimination issues. Punishment is never recommended."
