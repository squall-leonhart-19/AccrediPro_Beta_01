            "question": "A cat presents with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST critical to manage phosphorus levels and slow disease progression, based on recent studies?",
            "options": ["Increasing protein intake to support muscle mass.", "Restricting phosphorus intake to <0.5% on a dry matter basis.", "Supplementing with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids.", "Adding fiber to promote gut health."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restricting phosphorus intake is crucial in managing CKD. Studies show that diets with <0.5% phosphorus on a dry matter basis can significantly slow the progression of CKD in cats."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "During a feline behavior consultation, a client reports their cat frequently bites them during petting. According to advanced feline communication principles, what is the MOST likely explanation for this behavior?",
            "options": ["The cat is displaying dominance and asserting control.", "The cat is experiencing static electricity buildup.", "The cat is overstimulated and displaying redirected aggression.", "The cat is trying to groom the owner."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Petting-induced aggression is often due to overstimulation. Cats have a threshold for tactile interaction, and exceeding this can lead to biting. It's not necessarily dominance, but a response to discomfort or overstimulation."

        {
            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Which environmental enrichment strategy has been shown to MOST effectively reduce inter-cat aggression in multi-cat households, according to behavioral research?",
            "options": ["Increasing the number of food bowls and water stations.", "Providing multiple vertical spaces (e.g., cat trees, shelves).", "Using synthetic feline pheromone diffusers.", "Introducing a new cat to the household."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing multiple vertical spaces allows cats to establish their own territories and avoid confrontations, reducing stress and aggression. Studies indicate a significant decrease in aggression with ample vertical resources."
        },
        {
            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A cat exhibits signs of stress, including hiding, dilated pupils, and decreased appetite, after a recent move. Which intervention is MOST likely to provide immediate relief, based on feline stress management techniques?",
            "options": ["Administering a sedative medication.", "Providing a safe and secure hiding place (e.g., a covered cat bed).", "Introducing a new toy to distract the cat.", "Changing the cat's food to a more palatable option."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing a safe hiding place allows the cat to feel secure and regain control over its environment, reducing anxiety. This is a fundamental principle of feline stress management."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "You suspect a cat is experiencing chronic pain. Which validated pain scale is BEST suited for assessing pain levels in cats, considering its sensitivity and ease of use in clinical practice?",
            "options": ["Visual Analog Scale (VAS)", "Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)", "Feline Grimace Scale (FGS)", "Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS) - Feline Version"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS) - Feline Version is a validated and reliable tool for assessing pain in cats, incorporating behavioral and physiological parameters. The Feline Grimace Scale is also useful, but the GCPS provides a more comprehensive assessment."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Which proactive strategy is MOST effective in maintaining cognitive function and delaying the onset of age-related cognitive decline in senior cats?",
            "options": ["Providing a high-protein diet.", "Implementing environmental enrichment activities and mental stimulation.", "Administering antioxidant supplements.", "Reducing the cat's activity level to prevent injury."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Environmental enrichment and mental stimulation are crucial for maintaining cognitive function in senior cats. Studies suggest that engaging in play and providing novel experiences can help delay cognitive decline."

            "question": "A client is considering breeding their cat. Which genetic test is MOST important to perform to screen for common inherited diseases in cats, regardless of breed?",
            "options": ["Blood type testing.", "PCR testing for feline leukemia virus (FeLV).", "DNA testing for polycystic kidney disease (PKD1).", "Fecal parasite examination."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) is a common inherited disease, particularly in Persian and Exotic Shorthair cats. DNA testing is essential to identify affected or carrier cats and prevent the disease from being passed on to offspring."

            "question": "According to the PURRS Framework™, which element focuses on addressing the cat's emotional state and reducing anxiety through techniques like counter-conditioning and desensitization?",
            "options": ["Physical Health", "Understanding", "Respect", "Routine & Resources", "Safety"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Routine & Resources' element of the PURRS Framework™ directly addresses the cat's emotional well-being by establishing predictable routines and providing access to essential resources, which can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of security."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A multimodal approach is crucial for managing osteoarthritis in cats. Combining NSAIDs with weight management, environmental modifications (e.g., ramps, soft bedding), and physical therapy provides the most comprehensive and effective long-term pain relief."
