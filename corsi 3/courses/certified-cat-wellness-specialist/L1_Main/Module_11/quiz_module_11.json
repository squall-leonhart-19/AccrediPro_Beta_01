            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of incorporating novel protein sources into a cat's diet, especially for cats with suspected food sensitivities, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": ["Enhanced palatability for picky eaters", "Reduced risk of allergic reactions due to unfamiliarity", "Increased taurine content compared to common proteins", "Lower cost compared to traditional protein sources"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Novel proteins are less likely to trigger allergic reactions because the cat's immune system has not been previously exposed to them. This reduces the likelihood of an allergic response."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to L2, which of the following feline communication signals is MOST likely to indicate a cat is feeling threatened or defensive?",
            "options": ["Slow blinking", "Tail held high with a slight curve", "Ears flattened against the head and dilated pupils", "Kneading on a soft surface"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flattened ears and dilated pupils are classic signs of fear and defensiveness in cats. These signals often precede aggressive behavior."

            "question": "In L3, what is the recommended minimum number of scratching posts for a single-cat household to promote environmental enrichment and reduce destructive scratching behavior?",
            "options": ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing at least three scratching posts in various locations and orientations (vertical, horizontal) allows cats to express their natural scratching behaviors appropriately and helps protect furniture."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "What is the MOST effective strategy for calming an anxious cat during a thunderstorm, as discussed in L4?",
            "options": ["Forcing the cat to interact with you for reassurance", "Playing loud music to drown out the storm sounds", "Creating a safe and secure hiding place with familiar scents", "Administering a sedative without veterinary consultation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing a safe hiding place with familiar scents (e.g., a blanket with the cat's scent) allows the cat to feel secure and reduces anxiety during stressful events."

            "question": "In L5, what is the 'one-plus-one' rule in the context of multi-cat households?",
            "options": ["Each cat should have one more food bowl than the number of cats in the household", "Each cat should have one more litter box than the number of cats in the household", "Each cat should have one more scratching post than the number of cats in the household", "Each cat should have one more elevated perch than the number of cats in the household"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'one-plus-one' rule suggests providing one more litter box than the number of cats in the household to reduce competition and territorial marking."

            "options": ["Increased ability to digest fats", "Decreased protein requirements", "Reduced kidney function", "Increased sensitivity to bitter tastes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Reduced kidney function is a common age-related change in senior cats. This often necessitates dietary adjustments to support kidney health, such as reduced phosphorus levels and increased moisture content in the diet."

            "options": ["Recommend a new brand of litter", "Immediately prescribe anti-anxiety medication", "Schedule a veterinary appointment for a thorough medical evaluation", "Suggest adding another cat to the household for companionship"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "According to the PURRS Framework™, the first step is always to rule out underlying medical issues. Urinating outside the litter box and withdrawal can be signs of various health problems, especially in senior cats."

            "options": ["Punishing Shadow for aggressive behavior", "Increasing the number of shared resources (food bowls, litter boxes) and creating more vertical space", "Removing Shadow from the household", "Forcing Shadow to interact with the other cats under supervision"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that increasing resources and vertical space allowed the cats to avoid each other more easily and reduced competition, leading to a decrease in aggression."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Feline Calming Pheromone, often marketed as Feliway, mimics the natural facial pheromones that cats use to mark their territory as safe and secure. This can reduce stress and anxiety, especially in multi-cat environments."
