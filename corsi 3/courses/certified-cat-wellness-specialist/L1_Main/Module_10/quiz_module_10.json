            "question": "A 14-year-old cat with diagnosed chronic kidney disease (CKD) is exhibiting decreased appetite and weight loss. Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST appropriate, based on IRIS guidelines and recent studies?",
            "options": ["Increase protein intake to compensate for muscle wasting.", "Restrict phosphorus intake significantly to slow CKD progression.", "Supplement with high levels of vitamin D to improve kidney function.", "Offer dry kibble to encourage dental health and appetite."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restricting phosphorus is crucial in managing CKD. Studies show that lower phosphorus diets can significantly slow the progression of CKD in cats. High protein intake can exacerbate kidney issues."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "According to research on feline behavioral enrichment, which of the following environmental modifications is MOST likely to reduce inter-cat aggression in a multi-cat household?",
            "options": ["Removing all vertical space to prevent one cat from dominating.", "Increasing the number of shared food and water bowls to promote resource sharing.", "Providing multiple, separated feeding stations and litter boxes, each exceeding the number of cats.", "Using pheromone diffusers that emit a scent undetectable to humans."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Multiple, separated resources minimize competition and reduce stress, a key factor in inter-cat aggression. The rule of thumb is N+1, where N is the number of cats."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_3",
            "question": "A cat is displaying subtle signs of stress, including increased grooming, dilated pupils, and a flattened ear posture. According to the feline communication lesson, what is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately confine the cat to a small, quiet space.", "Offer a high-value treat to distract the cat.", "Identify and remove the potential stressor from the environment.", "Approach the cat and attempt to provide reassurance through petting."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Identifying and removing the stressor is the most effective initial response. Increased grooming, dilated pupils, and flattened ears are often subtle signs of stress that require immediate attention to the environment."

        {
            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "In a multi-cat household, one cat consistently blocks another cat from accessing resources. What strategy, based on the P.U.R.R.S. framework, would be MOST effective in addressing this issue?",
            "options": ["Punish the blocking cat with a spray of water.", "Ignore the behavior and hope it resolves on its own.", "Provide separate resources in multiple locations and use positive reinforcement to encourage peaceful interactions.", "Isolate the victim cat in a separate room."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing separate resources in multiple locations minimizes competition and reduces stress. Positive reinforcement helps build positive associations and encourages peaceful interactions."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "An 18-year-old cat is experiencing cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate to improve their quality of life?",
            "options": ["Increase the cat's physical activity to stimulate brain function.", "Provide a predictable routine, easily accessible resources, and cognitive enrichment activities.", "Significantly reduce the cat's caloric intake to prevent weight gain.", "Discontinue all veterinary care to minimize stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A predictable routine, easily accessible resources, and cognitive enrichment activities are crucial for managing CDS and improving quality of life in senior cats. Regular veterinary checks are also essential."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "During a home visit, you discover a cat has ingested a significant amount of chocolate. What is the FIRST action you should advise the owner to take?",
            "options": ["Induce vomiting immediately using hydrogen peroxide.", "Monitor the cat for symptoms and wait for them to pass.", "Contact a veterinarian or animal poison control center immediately.", "Administer activated charcoal at home."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Contacting a veterinarian or animal poison control center is the most appropriate first action. They can provide specific guidance based on the type and amount of chocolate ingested."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_7",
            "question": "In the 'Shadow' case study (P.U.R.R.S. Framework), a cat displayed aggression towards visitors due to underlying anxiety. Which combination of interventions proved MOST effective?",
            "options": ["Pharmaceutical intervention alone", "Environmental modification alone", "A combination of environmental modification, behavior modification, and pharmaceutical intervention", "Complete isolation from visitors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Shadow' case study highlighted that a multi-faceted approach, combining environmental changes, behavioral training (desensitization and counterconditioning), and medication (under veterinary supervision) was most successful."

            "id": "q10_8",
            "question": "You are consulting with a client who wants to declaw their cat. Ethically, what is your BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Perform the declawing procedure if the client insists and is willing to pay.", "Educate the client about the procedure's potential negative impacts and offer alternative solutions.", "Recommend declawing only on the front paws.", "Decline to work with the client altogether."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Educating the client about the procedure's potential negative impacts and offering alternative solutions aligns with ethical feline wellness consulting. Declawing is considered inhumane by many veterinarians and behaviorists."
        },
        {
            "id": "q10_9",
            "question": "A cat in a multi-cat household is consistently displaying signs of stress (hiding, hissing) despite environmental modifications. Feliway diffusers have not proven effective. What further intervention should be considered?",
            "options": ["Increasing the number of cats in the household to promote socialization.", "Rehoming the stressed cat to a single-cat household.", "Consulting with a veterinary behaviorist for potential pharmaceutical intervention.", "Ignoring the behavior and hoping the cat adapts over time."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If environmental modifications and pheromone therapy are ineffective, consulting with a veterinary behaviorist is the next logical step. Pharmaceutical intervention may be necessary to manage the cat's anxiety."

            "id": "q10_10",
            "question": "A client reports that their senior cat has started urinating outside the litter box. Besides ruling out medical causes, what is the MOST important environmental adjustment to recommend?",
            "options": ["Moving the litter box to a less accessible location to discourage inappropriate urination.", "Switching to a scented litter to mask the odor of urine.", "Providing litter boxes with low sides or ramps for easier access.", "Discontinuing litter box use altogether and transitioning to puppy pads."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senior cats may have mobility issues, making it difficult to enter and exit a standard litter box. Low-sided boxes or ramps can make it easier for them to use the litter box comfortably."
