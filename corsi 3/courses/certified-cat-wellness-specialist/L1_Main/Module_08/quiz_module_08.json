            "question": "According to the PURRS Framework™, what does the 'S' stand for?",
            "options": ["Socialization", "Stimulation", "Safety", "Security"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in the PURRS Framework™ represents Safety, focusing on creating a secure and predictable environment for the cat."

            "question": "A client reports their cat, Mittens, frequently scratches furniture. What is the FIRST step you should advise them to take, based on feline behavior principles?",
            "options": ["Apply deterrent sprays to the furniture.", "Provide multiple scratching posts of different materials and orientations.", "Consider declawing the cat.", "Confine the cat to a room without furniture."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing appropriate scratching outlets is the first and most important step in addressing furniture scratching. Deterrent sprays and confinement are less effective and can be stressful. Declawing is ethically unacceptable."

            "question": "A cat exhibits a low, rumbling purr, flattened ears, and a twitching tail. What is the MOST likely emotional state of the cat?",
            "options": ["Contentment", "Relaxation", "Anxiety or Fear", "Playfulness"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While purring is often associated with contentment, in combination with flattened ears and a twitching tail, it's more likely an indication of anxiety or fear. Context is crucial in interpreting feline communication."

            "question": "What percentage of a cat's daily water intake is typically derived from their food when fed a wet food diet?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50-70%", "Approximately 90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Wet food diets can provide approximately 50-70% of a cat's daily water needs, making them beneficial for cats prone to dehydration or urinary issues. A 2018 study by Becker et al. demonstrated the impact of moisture content on feline hydration levels."

            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective strategy for introducing a new cat to a household with an existing cat?",
            "options": ["Immediately placing them in the same room to 'sort things out'.", "Supervised short visits, gradually increasing time spent together, while providing separate resources.", "Rubbing a towel on one cat and then placing it near the other cat.", "Isolating the new cat for a week, then releasing it into the house."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual introductions, allowing cats to adjust to each other's scent and presence before direct interaction, minimize stress and aggression. Separate resources are essential to prevent competition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The AAFP recommends veterinary checkups every six months for senior cats due to the increased risk of age-related health issues. This allows for early detection and management of potential problems."

            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "Which type of play is MOST beneficial for stimulating a cat's natural hunting instincts?",
            "options": ["Chasing a laser pointer.", "Playing with a stationary toy mouse.", "Interactive play with a wand toy mimicking prey behavior.", "Providing a puzzle feeder with dry food."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interactive play with a wand toy that mimics the movement of prey (hunting, chasing, catching) is most effective in satisfying a cat's natural hunting instincts. Laser pointers can cause frustration as the cat can never 'catch' the light."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Addressing potential underlying causes, such as boredom, hunger, or a dirty litter box, is crucial before resorting to punishment or medication. Environmental enrichment and routine can reduce nighttime vocalization."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Daily brushing removes loose fur, preventing the cat from ingesting it during self-grooming and reducing the formation of hairballs. While diet can play a role, brushing is the primary preventative measure."

            "explanation": "Providing a safe haven allows the cat to adjust to the new environment at its own pace, reducing stress and promoting a sense of security. Gradually expanding the territory prevents overwhelming the cat."
