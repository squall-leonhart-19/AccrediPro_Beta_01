        {
            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of positive reinforcement in cat training?",
            "options": ["To punish undesirable behaviors", "To increase the frequency of desirable behaviors", "To confuse the cat with mixed signals", "To ignore all behaviors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Positive reinforcement focuses on rewarding desired behaviors to increase their occurrence, rather than punishing undesirable ones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is the BEST example of a primary reinforcer for most cats?",
            "options": ["Verbal praise", "A favorite toy", "A gentle scratch behind the ears", "A small piece of cooked chicken"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Primary reinforcers are naturally rewarding, such as food. While toys and praise can be effective, food typically has a stronger initial impact."

        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to a study discussed in the module, what percentage of cats showed improved litter box habits when positive reinforcement was used consistently?",
            "options": ["25%", "50%", "75%", "90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The module highlighted a study indicating that approximately 75% of cats demonstrated improved litter box habits with consistent positive reinforcement strategies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which of the following schedules of reinforcement is MOST resistant to extinction?",
            "options": ["Continuous reinforcement", "Fixed ratio reinforcement", "Fixed interval reinforcement", "Variable ratio reinforcement"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Variable ratio reinforcement, where rewards are given after an unpredictable number of responses, is highly resistant to extinction because the cat never knows when the next reward will come."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "You are trying to train your cat to use a scratching post. You reward her every time she touches the post. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Negative punishment", "Shaping", "Extinction", "Classical conditioning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shaping involves reinforcing successive approximations of the desired behavior. In this case, touching the scratching post is a step towards the desired behavior of scratching it."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Client Mittens, a 3-year-old cat, has started urinating outside the litter box. After a vet visit rules out medical causes, what is the FIRST step you should recommend to the owner regarding positive reinforcement?",
            "options": ["Punish Mittens when she eliminates outside the box", "Thoroughly clean soiled areas with an enzymatic cleaner", "Ignore the behavior and hope it stops", "Move the litter box to a less accessible location"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cleaning soiled areas with an enzymatic cleaner removes the scent, which can attract the cat back to the same spot. This is crucial before implementing positive reinforcement for using the litter box."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "When reinforcing calm behavior, what is the optimal timing for delivering the reinforcement?",
            "options": ["Immediately after the cat exhibits a calm behavior", "30 minutes after the cat exhibits a calm behavior", "Right before the cat is expected to exhibit a calm behavior", "Whenever the owner remembers to do so"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Timing is crucial in positive reinforcement. Delivering the reward immediately after the desired behavior (calmness) helps the cat associate the behavior with the reward."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a sign that your positive reinforcement strategy needs adjustment?",
            "options": ["The cat's behavior is not improving after several weeks", "The cat is showing signs of stress or anxiety", "The cat consistently performs the desired behavior without reinforcement", "The cat is becoming overly reliant on treats"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the cat consistently performs the desired behavior without reinforcement, it indicates that the behavior is well-established, and the reinforcement can be gradually faded."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "According to case studies in the module, what is a common mistake owners make when trying to reinforce positive scratching behavior?",
            "options": ["Providing too many scratching posts", "Using a scratching post that is too tall", "Not making the scratching post more appealing than furniture", "Rewarding the cat every time it scratches, even on furniture"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Owners often fail to make the scratching post more attractive than furniture, leading the cat to continue scratching the furniture. The scratching post needs to be appealing in terms of location, texture, and stability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "You are using clicker training to reinforce calm behavior in a nervous cat. The cat flinches at the sound of the clicker. What should you do?",
            "options": ["Continue using the clicker, as the cat will eventually get used to it", "Pair the clicker with a high-value treat to create a positive association", "Switch to a different marker signal, such as a soft verbal cue", "Stop training altogether, as the cat is clearly too anxious"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If the cat is negatively reacting to the clicker, using a different marker signal is the best course of action. A soft verbal cue can be less startling and more effective for nervous cats."
