            "question": "A client reports that their cat, Mittens, has started urinating outside the litter box. According to the principles discussed in 'Stress and Anxiety: Identifying and Managing Triggers', what is the MOST important first step?",
            "options": ["Immediately try a new type of litter.", "Consult with a veterinarian to rule out medical causes.", "Add another litter box in a different location.", "Punish Mittens for urinating outside the box."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ruling out medical causes is paramount. Urinary issues can be caused by underlying health problems, and addressing those first is crucial before considering behavioral interventions. As discussed in the lesson, pain can significantly contribute to changes in elimination habits."

            "question": "In 'Decoding Feline Communication: Beyond Meows and Purrs,' what does a slow blink from a cat typically indicate?",
            "options": ["Aggression and potential attack.", "Fear and a desire to escape.", "Affection and trust.", "Boredom and a need for stimulation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A slow blink is often referred to as a 'cat kiss' and indicates that the cat feels comfortable and safe in your presence. It's a sign of trust and affection, as covered in the lesson on feline communication."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to 'Environmental Enrichment: Meeting Behavioral Needs,' which of the following is the LEAST effective form of environmental enrichment for an indoor cat?",
            "options": ["Providing multiple scratching posts of different materials.", "Offering puzzle feeders to stimulate foraging behavior.", "Allowing the cat unsupervised access to an open window.", "Creating vertical space with cat trees and shelves."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Unsupervised access to an open window poses significant safety risks, including falls and escapes. While observing the outdoors can be enriching, it should always be done under supervision or with secure window perches. The other options all provide safe and stimulating enrichment."

            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Based on the 'Nutritional Needs: Fueling Physical and Mental Health' lesson, what is the primary reason cats require a diet high in animal protein?",
            "options": ["To maintain a healthy coat and skin.", "To support proper digestion and nutrient absorption.", "To provide essential amino acids that they cannot synthesize themselves.", "To prevent the formation of hairballs."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cats are obligate carnivores and require essential amino acids, such as taurine, that are primarily found in animal protein. They cannot synthesize these amino acids adequately on their own, making a high-protein diet crucial for their health."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "You observe two cats in a multi-cat household engaging in allorubbing (rubbing against each other). According to 'Social Dynamics: Understanding Feline Relationships,' what does this behavior MOST likely indicate?",
            "options": ["An impending fight over resources.", "Establishment of a shared group scent and social bond.", "One cat is trying to assert dominance over the other.", "One cat is sick and seeking comfort from the other."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Allorubbing is a common affiliative behavior in cats, indicating a positive social bond. It helps to create a shared group scent, reinforcing their connection and reducing tension within the group. As discussed in the lesson, scent is a key element of feline social dynamics."

            "question": "A 14-year-old cat, Whiskers, has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis. According to 'Pain Recognition and Management: A Crucial Aspect of Wellness,' which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial approach to pain management?",
            "options": ["Administering human pain medication, such as ibuprofen.", "Ignoring the pain as a normal part of aging.", "Consulting with a veterinarian to develop a multimodal pain management plan.", "Encouraging Whiskers to exercise more vigorously to loosen joints."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Osteoarthritis is a common source of chronic pain in senior cats. A multimodal pain management plan, developed in consultation with a veterinarian, is essential to address the pain effectively and improve Whiskers' quality of life. Human pain medications can be toxic to cats."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Based on 'Cognitive Function: Maintaining Mental Acuity in Senior Cats,' what is one strategy to help slow cognitive decline in aging cats?",
            "options": ["Decreasing interaction to avoid overstimulation.", "Introducing new and challenging toys regularly.", "Maintaining a consistent routine and predictable environment.", "Switching to a less palatable diet to encourage better eating habits."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing novel enrichment and stimulating activities can help maintain cognitive function in senior cats. Introducing new toys, puzzle feeders, and interactive play sessions can challenge their minds and help slow age-related decline. Maintaining routine is also important, but novel enrichment provides cognitive stimulation."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In 'The Role of Play: Stimulating Mind and Body,' what is the primary benefit of providing cats with toys that mimic prey?",
            "options": ["To reduce the risk of obesity.", "To satisfy their natural hunting instincts and reduce predatory behavior towards other pets or people.", "To improve their balance and coordination.", "To prevent the development of allergies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Play that mimics hunting allows cats to express their natural predatory behaviors in a safe and controlled manner. This can help reduce frustration and the likelihood of redirecting these behaviors towards inappropriate targets, such as other pets or people. The lesson emphasized the importance of satisfying these natural instincts."

            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "Case Study: A client reports their cat, Shadow, is hiding more frequently and hissing at the other cat in the household. Based on the lessons in this module, what combination of factors is MOST likely contributing to Shadow's behavior?",
            "options": ["Increased playtime and a new scratching post.", "Introduction of a new cat scent into the home environment and perceived resource competition.", "A recent change in diet and improved litter box hygiene.", "Consistent daily routine and ample vertical space."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hiding and hissing are often signs of stress and anxiety in cats. The introduction of a new scent can disrupt the established social order, and perceived resource competition (e.g., food, water, litter boxes) can exacerbate these issues, as discussed in several lessons in this module. These factors create a stressful environment for Shadow."

            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 20%", "Around 50%", "Over 80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that approximately 50% of cats in multi-cat households may exhibit stress-related behaviors. This highlights the importance of understanding feline social dynamics and providing adequate resources and environmental enrichment to minimize stress in these environments. This statistic was discussed in the lesson to emphasize the prevalence of stress."
