            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) case study, what percentage of cats showed improvement in clinical signs after environmental enrichment strategies were implemented?",
            "options": ["20%", "40%", "60%", "80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study demonstrated that approximately 60% of cats with FIC showed a reduction in clinical signs following the implementation of environmental enrichment strategies."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A rescue cat exhibiting anxiety and destructive behavior is diagnosed with separation anxiety. Which of the following is the LEAST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Providing puzzle feeders for mental stimulation", "Punishing the cat for destructive behavior", "Creating a safe and predictable environment", "Using pheromone diffusers to reduce anxiety"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Punishment is counterproductive in managing anxiety-related behaviors and can worsen the cat's fear and stress. Positive reinforcement and environmental modifications are more effective."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the weight management case study, what is the recommended initial percentage reduction in daily caloric intake for an obese cat to promote safe weight loss?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "10-15%", "15-20%", "20-25%"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A gradual reduction of 5-10% in daily caloric intake is recommended to promote safe and sustainable weight loss in obese cats, minimizing the risk of hepatic lipidosis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "Which of the following strategies is most likely to reduce aggression between cats in a multi-cat household, based on the case study?",
            "options": ["Punishing the aggressor cat", "Forcing the cats to interact more frequently", "Providing separate resources and safe spaces for each cat", "Removing the victim cat from the household"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing separate resources (food, water, litter boxes, scratching posts) and safe spaces minimizes competition and reduces the likelihood of conflict between cats."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A cat with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is exhibiting decreased appetite and nausea. Which of the following interventions is most appropriate to improve their quality of life?",
            "options": ["Administering a corticosteroid to stimulate appetite", "Switching to a diet with high phosphorus content", "Administering an antiemetic medication as prescribed by a veterinarian", "Forcing the cat to eat a large meal"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Antiemetic medications can help reduce nausea and improve appetite in cats with CKD, thus enhancing their quality of life. Corticosteroids have potential side effects and are not always the first-line treatment."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the hyperthyroidism case study, which of the following systemic effects is LEAST likely to be associated with untreated hyperthyroidism in cats?",
            "options": ["Weight loss", "Increased appetite", "Bradycardia (slow heart rate)", "Hypertension"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperthyroidism typically causes tachycardia (rapid heart rate), not bradycardia, due to the increased levels of thyroid hormones affecting the cardiovascular system."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "According to the FLUTD case study, what environmental factor is most strongly correlated with increased risk of FLUTD recurrence in cats?",
            "options": ["Access to a water fountain", "Multi-cat household with resource competition", "Indoor-only lifestyle", "High-protein diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stress associated with multi-cat households and resource competition is a significant risk factor for FLUTD recurrence. Cats may feel threatened or unable to access resources, leading to increased stress and urinary issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "When using the PURRS framework for a cat presenting with both anxiety and FLUTD, what does the 'R' in PURRS specifically represent?",
            "options": ["Routine", "Resources", "Relationship", "Rest"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the PURRS framework, 'R' stands for Resources, which includes ensuring adequate and accessible food, water, litter boxes, scratching posts, and resting areas for the cat."

            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client reports their cat, previously well-behaved, has started urinating outside the litter box. Applying the PURRS framework, which aspect should be investigated FIRST?",
            "options": ["Stressors in the environment or routine", "Kidney function", "Dietary changes", "Play schedule"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "According to the PURRS framework, addressing potential stressors (S) in the cat's environment or routine is the first step when investigating behavioral changes like inappropriate elimination."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A 10-year-old cat presents with weight loss, increased appetite, and increased thirst. Bloodwork reveals elevated T4 levels and mild azotemia. Integrating information from the hyperthyroidism and CKD case studies, what is the most likely primary diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)", "Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)", "Hyperthyroidism with secondary renal changes", "Diabetes Mellitus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The combination of weight loss, increased appetite/thirst, elevated T4, and mild azotemia strongly suggests hyperthyroidism with secondary renal changes (CKD). Hyperthyroidism can exacerbate underlying kidney issues."
