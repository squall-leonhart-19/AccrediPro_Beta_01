            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical first step in synthesizing assessment data to formulate effective treatment goals for a feline wellness plan?",
            "options": ["Identifying the cat's favorite treats.", "Determining the owner's lifestyle and preferences.", "Prioritizing identified issues based on their impact on the cat's overall well-being and safety.", "Measuring the cat's weight and body condition score."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing issues ensures that the most pressing concerns, such as those affecting safety or well-being, are addressed first. While other options are important, they follow the initial prioritization."

            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A 3-year-old indoor cat, 'Cleo,' presents with chronic stress-related cystitis and destructive scratching. Based on evidence-based intervention strategies, which of the following should be the FIRST line of treatment?",
            "options": ["Prescription medication for anxiety.", "Surgical declawing to prevent scratching.", "Environmental enrichment, including increased vertical space and interactive play.", "Punishment-based training techniques to deter scratching."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental enrichment is a non-invasive, evidence-based strategy that addresses the underlying causes of stress and provides alternative outlets for natural behaviors. Medication may be considered later if environmental changes are insufficient."

            "id": "q21_3",
            "question": "When tailoring a treatment plan for a cat with anxiety, which of the following factors is LEAST important to consider?",
            "options": ["The cat's individual personality and temperament.", "The owner's ability to consistently implement the plan.", "The cat's breed predispositions to certain health conditions.", "The veterinarian's preferred treatment protocols."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While veterinary input is crucial, the plan should be tailored to the individual cat and owner. Overriding individual needs with solely the veterinarian's preference is not in the best interest of the cat."

            "id": "q21_4",
            "question": "A cat is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. What is the MOST important aspect of integrating veterinary care into the wellness plan?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diabetes management requires ongoing veterinary monitoring to ensure the cat's blood glucose levels are well-controlled and to adjust insulin dosages as needed. Ignoring veterinary advice can lead to serious complications."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Ignoring behavioral problems is never an appropriate solution. A multifaceted approach involves actively addressing the issue through various strategies."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective environmental enrichment aims to satisfy a cat's inherent instincts and behaviors, promoting physical and psychological well-being. The other options are counterproductive to this goal."

            "options": ["Immediately switching to a very low-calorie diet.", "Consulting with a veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist to determine the appropriate calorie restriction and diet composition.", "Feeding the cat only dry food to reduce calorie intake.", "Ignoring the weight issue as long as the cat seems happy."],

            "options": ["Strictly adhering to the initial plan without making any adjustments.", "Regularly reassessing the cat's needs and making adjustments to the plan as necessary.", "Assuming the plan will work indefinitely without ongoing monitoring.", "Focusing solely on the physical aspects of wellness and neglecting behavioral or emotional needs."],

            "explanation": "A successful wellness plan requires ongoing monitoring and adaptation to address changes in the cat's health, behavior, and environment. Rigidity can lead to plan failure."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inappropriate elimination often stems from litter box aversion or stress. Providing multiple, clean, and accessible litter boxes addresses these underlying issues, leading to long-term resolution."
