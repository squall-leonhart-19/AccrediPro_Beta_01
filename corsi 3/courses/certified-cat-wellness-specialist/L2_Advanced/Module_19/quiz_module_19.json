A new client, Mr. Jones, is skeptical. How should you best explain the benefit of environmental enrichment to him?",
            "options": ["Dismiss his skepticism and insist he trust your expertise.", "Explain that while individual results vary, research strongly suggests enrichment can significantly reduce stress in most shelter cats.", "Tell him the study proves enrichment will eliminate stress in his cat.", "Ignore the research and focus solely on his personal observations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledge individual variability but emphasize the overall positive impact based on research evidence."
