            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of ethical practice in cat wellness?",
            "options": ["Following personal beliefs about what is right and wrong.", "Adhering strictly to the letter of the law, regardless of context.", "Acting in accordance with professional guidelines and moral principles to ensure the well-being of the cat and client.", "Prioritizing the financial interests of the practitioner above all else."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice in cat wellness prioritizes the well-being of the cat and client by adhering to professional guidelines and moral principles. This goes beyond personal beliefs or legal compliance and avoids prioritizing financial gain over welfare."

            "question": "According to the lesson on Informed Consent, what information should a cat wellness specialist ALWAYS provide to a client before initiating a new intervention?",
            "options": ["The specialist's hourly rate.", "A guarantee of a successful outcome.", "A detailed explanation of the intervention, potential risks and benefits, alternative options, and the right to refuse or withdraw consent.", "The names and contact information of previous clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "A client discloses to you that they occasionally 'discipline' their cat with a spray bottle when the cat scratches furniture. What is your ethical obligation regarding confidentiality?",
            "options": ["You must immediately report this to animal welfare authorities, regardless of the client's wishes.", "You should maintain confidentiality unless you believe the cat is at significant risk of harm, in which case you should follow your professional guidelines for reporting suspected abuse.", "You should confront the client and demand they stop the behavior.", "You should ignore the behavior, as it is a common practice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is crucial, it is not absolute. If there is a reasonable belief that the cat is at significant risk of harm, ethical guidelines typically require reporting suspected abuse to the appropriate authorities, balancing confidentiality with the duty to protect the animal."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "You are offered a significant discount on cat food by a company if you recommend their product to all your clients. What ethical conflict of interest does this present?",
            "options": ["A conflict between your financial interests and your professional obligation to provide unbiased recommendations based on the best interests of the cat.", "No conflict of interest, as long as the cat food is of reasonable quality.", "A conflict between your personal preference for the brand and your client's budget.", "No conflict of interest, as discounts are a normal business practice."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Accepting incentives to recommend specific products creates a conflict of interest, as your recommendations may be influenced by personal gain rather than the cat's best interests. Maintaining professional objectivity is paramount."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aversive training methods, such as shock collars, carry a high risk of causing physical and psychological harm to cats. Ethical guidelines strongly discourage their use and emphasize positive reinforcement techniques."

If the cat's condition continues to worsen, escalate the concern following established protocols.", "Continue to offer advice on essential oil usage to minimize harm.", "Terminate the relationship with Mrs. Davis immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In this scenario, the initial ethical response involves education and clear communication about the risks of the client's actions. If the cat's condition deteriorates, further action, such as reporting to relevant authorities, may be necessary, but the first step is to attempt to educate and persuade the client to seek appropriate veterinary care."
