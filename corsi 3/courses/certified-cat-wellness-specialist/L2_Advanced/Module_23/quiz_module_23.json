            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective environmental enrichment strategy for a cat exhibiting predatory behavior towards housemates, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": ["Providing a taller cat tree.", "Increasing the frequency of interactive play sessions using a fishing-pole toy.", "Adding a scratching post near the target's resting area.", "Using Feliway diffusers throughout the house."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interactive play, especially with toys mimicking prey, allows the cat to fulfill its predatory instincts in a safe and controlled manner, reducing the likelihood of directing these behaviors towards other pets."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "According to the precision nutrition guidelines in L2, what percentage of protein (on a dry matter basis) is generally recommended for a cat with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the IRIS stage 2?",
            "options": ["Greater than 40%", "Between 30-35%", "Between 25-30%", "Less than 20%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lowering protein intake to between 25-30% dry matter basis is recommended for cats with IRIS stage 2 CKD to help manage azotemia and reduce the workload on the kidneys. However, it's important to maintain adequate protein to prevent muscle wasting."

            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "A client reports their cat is consistently exhibiting displacement behaviors (e.g., excessive grooming, redirected aggression) after a new baby arrives. Based on L3, what is the FIRST modification you should suggest to the client's approach?",
            "options": ["Administering a daily dose of L-theanine.", "Creating predictable routines and ensuring the cat has access to safe, quiet spaces.", "Using a citronella spray to deter the cat from entering the baby's room.", "Recommending a consult with a veterinary behaviorist for psychotropic medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing predictability and safe spaces is crucial for reducing stress in cats, especially during significant environmental changes like the arrival of a new baby. This addresses the underlying anxiety causing the displacement behaviors."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Which of the following stress-reduction techniques discussed in L4 has demonstrated the MOST significant reduction in cortisol levels in shelter cats according to peer-reviewed research?",
            "options": ["Providing classical music enrichment.", "Introducing visual barriers between cages.", "Administering synthetic facial pheromones (Feliway).", "Increasing human interaction time to 30 minutes per day."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that visual barriers significantly reduce stress in shelter cats by minimizing visual confrontation and perceived threats, leading to lower cortisol levels. Music and human interaction can be helpful, but visual barriers are more impactful in this context."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "A 14-year-old cat diagnosed with osteoarthritis experiences breakthrough pain despite being on meloxicam. According to L5, which of the following adjunctive pain management therapies would be MOST appropriate to consider FIRST?",
            "options": ["Amantadine", "Gabapentin", "Acupuncture", "Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycan (PSGAG) injections"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gabapentin is often used as an adjunctive analgesic for chronic pain in cats, particularly neuropathic pain or pain not fully controlled by NSAIDs like meloxicam. It is generally well-tolerated and can provide additional pain relief."

            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In L6, the concept of 'biophilia' is discussed in relation to holistic feline wellness. Which of the following best exemplifies applying biophilic design principles to a cat's indoor environment?",
            "options": ["Using brightly colored, artificial toys.", "Providing a water fountain with filtered water.", "Creating a stimulating indoor environment using natural materials, sunlight, and plants (non-toxic).", "Regularly cleaning the litter box with scented cleaner."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biophilia refers to the innate human connection to nature. For cats, this translates to providing environments that mimic natural settings, including access to sunlight, natural materials like wood and sisal, and safe plants for exploration and interaction."

            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when administering subcutaneous fluids to a senior cat with reduced skin elasticity (as covered in L7)?",
            "options": ["Using a larger gauge needle for faster administration.", "Administering the fluids at room temperature.", "Avoiding overhydration by carefully monitoring the cat's hydration status and adjusting fluid volume accordingly.", "Administering the entire prescribed volume in one location."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Senior cats are more prone to overhydration due to decreased kidney function and reduced skin elasticity. Careful monitoring and appropriate fluid volume adjustments are crucial to prevent complications."

            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "Client: 'My cat, Whiskers, 10 years old, has started urinating outside the litterbox. I've added another box, but it didn't help. He still seems to enjoy playing and eating.' According to the PURRS Framework™ (L8), which area should be addressed FIRST?",
            "options": ["Play & Predatory Behavior", "Understanding & Unconditional Love", "Resources", "Safe Place"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PURRS framework prioritizes Resources, which include litter box location, type, and cleanliness. Addressing this area first is crucial, as inappropriate elimination can stem from aversion to the litter box itself. Since adding a box didn't solve the issue, further investigating the type of litter, location, or cleanliness is warranted."

        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A cat is displaying signs of cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) including disorientation and altered sleep-wake cycles. Which nutritional supplement, discussed in L7, has shown the MOST promise in mitigating these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Taurine", "L-Lysine", "SAMe (S-Adenosylmethionine)", "Omega-3 Fatty Acids"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "SAMe has shown promise in improving cognitive function and reducing oxidative stress in aging cats with CDS. While other supplements may offer general health benefits, SAMe specifically targets the neurological aspects of CDS."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "In L8, the PURRS Framework™ emphasizes 'Safe Place' as crucial for feline well-being. Which of the following actions BEST supports this element for a multi-cat household experiencing inter-cat aggression?",
            "options": ["Ensuring each cat has multiple elevated resting spots and hiding places distributed throughout the home.", "Using a single large litter box to encourage communal elimination.", "Forcing the cats to interact during playtime to encourage bonding.", "Punishing aggressive behavior to discourage future conflicts."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Providing multiple, strategically placed safe spaces allows cats to retreat and avoid confrontation, reducing stress and the likelihood of aggression. Elevated spots and hiding places offer a sense of security and control over their environment."
