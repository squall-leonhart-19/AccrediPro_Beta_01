            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A client has three cats exhibiting inter-cat aggression, despite ample resources. Which of the following is the MOST crucial first step, according to the PURRS protocol?",
            "options": ["Immediately rehoming the least assertive cat.", "Increasing food bowl proximity to encourage resource sharing.", "Identifying and addressing the underlying cause of the aggression.", "Administering calming pheromones to all cats."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying the underlying cause (e.g., fear, competition, redirected aggression) is paramount for effective intervention, as emphasized in the PURRS protocol. Addressing the cause before other interventions increases the likelihood of success."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "An 18-year-old cat presents with disorientation, altered sleep-wake cycles, and inappropriate elimination. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome", "Feline Cognitive Dysfunction (FCD)", "Pancreatitis", "Hyperthyroidism"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disorientation, altered sleep-wake cycles, and inappropriate elimination are hallmark signs of Feline Cognitive Dysfunction (FCD) in senior cats. While other conditions can cause similar symptoms, FCD is the most probable diagnosis given the age and presentation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A cat with a Body Condition Score (BCS) of 8/9 is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis. What is the MOST appropriate initial dietary recommendation?",
            "options": ["A high-carbohydrate diet to increase insulin sensitivity.", "A calorie-restricted, high-protein diet to promote weight loss and muscle maintenance.", "A diet rich in omega-6 fatty acids to reduce inflammation.", "A completely raw food diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A calorie-restricted, high-protein diet is ideal for obese diabetic cats with osteoarthritis. It promotes weight loss, which improves insulin sensitivity and reduces joint stress, while maintaining muscle mass. According to recent studies, a high protein diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A cat exhibits fear-based aggression towards visitors. The owner reports the cat hides for hours after someone leaves. What intervention should be prioritized?",
            "options": ["Flooding the cat with exposure to visitors.", "Creating a safe room and using counter-conditioning techniques.", "Administering a sedative before visitors arrive.", "Ignoring the behavior in hopes it will extinguish."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating a safe room provides the cat with a secure retreat, while counter-conditioning gradually associates visitors with positive experiences, reducing fear and aggression. Flooding can worsen anxiety, and ignoring the behavior is unlikely to resolve the issue."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A cat with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is in IRIS Stage 3 and exhibits decreased appetite and weight loss. Which intervention is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Increasing the protein content of the diet to improve energy levels.", "Administering subcutaneous fluids and phosphate binders.", "Encouraging exercise to stimulate appetite.", "Switching to a completely dry food diet for dental health."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Subcutaneous fluids help maintain hydration, and phosphate binders reduce phosphorus levels, both crucial for managing CKD. Increasing protein can worsen kidney function, and dry food can exacerbate dehydration. Appetite stimulants may also be considered in consultation with a veterinarian."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client is resistant to implementing environmental enrichment strategies for their indoor cat, stating, 'My cat is happy just sleeping all day.' What is the BEST response?",
            "options": ["Agreeing with the client to avoid conflict.", "Emphasizing that enrichment is optional and only for 'bored' cats.", "Educating the client about the link between enrichment and feline well-being, providing examples of simple, low-cost options.", "Insisting that the client immediately purchase expensive cat trees and toys."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Educating the client about the benefits of enrichment, such as reduced stress and improved physical health, and offering practical, affordable suggestions is the most effective approach. A study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery indicated that even minimal environmental changes can positively impact feline behavior."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Which of the following environmental modifications is MOST beneficial for a senior cat with mobility issues due to osteoarthritis?",
            "options": ["Removing all soft bedding to encourage mobility.", "Placing food and water bowls on elevated surfaces.", "Providing ramps or steps to access favorite resting spots.", "Relocating the litter box to a distant location to promote exercise."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing ramps or steps allows senior cats to access preferred locations without straining their joints, improving their quality of life. Elevated food and water bowls can be helpful for some cats, but may also cause discomfort in cats with neck or back pain."

        {
            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A client is considering euthanasia for their cat with advanced CKD, citing financial constraints. What is the MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending euthanasia.", "Pressuring the client to pursue all available treatments, regardless of cost.", "Exploring all available options, including palliative care, financial assistance programs, and quality-of-life assessment, before discussing euthanasia.", "Providing false hope by downplaying the severity of the condition."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A thorough exploration of all available options, including palliative care and financial assistance, is ethically paramount before considering euthanasia. The goal is to support the client in making an informed decision that prioritizes the cat's well-being."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A cat is displaying signs of anxiety, including hiding, excessive grooming, and vocalization. The owner has already tried Feliway diffusers with limited success. What additional environmental enrichment strategy is MOST likely to be beneficial?",
            "options": ["Removing all hiding places to force the cat to socialize.", "Providing interactive food puzzles and vertical climbing structures.", "Switching to a scented litter to mask urine odors.", "Playing loud music to drown out external noises."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interactive food puzzles and vertical climbing structures provide mental and physical stimulation, helping to reduce anxiety and redirect the cat's focus. These strategies address the cat's need for enrichment and control over its environment."

        {
            "id": "q17_10",
            "question": "During a consultation, a client becomes defensive and dismissive when you suggest dietary changes for their overweight cat. What is the BEST approach to de-escalate the situation and promote collaboration?",
            "options": ["Immediately challenging the client's beliefs and asserting your expertise.", "Acknowledging the client's feelings, expressing empathy, and collaboratively exploring solutions.", "Ending the consultation to avoid further conflict.", "Ignoring the client's resistance and focusing solely on the cat's needs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the client's feelings and expressing empathy creates a safe space for open communication and collaboration. This approach allows you to address the client's concerns and work together to develop a plan that benefits the cat."
