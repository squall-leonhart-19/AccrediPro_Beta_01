            "options": ["Profile & Preferences", "Uncover Underlying Needs", "Recommend & Refine Strategies", "Reinforce Positive Habits"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Uncover Underlying Needs' step in the P.U.R.R.S. Framework™ is specifically focused on identifying the root causes of wellness challenges by exploring the cat's physical, mental, and emotional needs. This involves a deep dive into the cat's history, environment, and behavior to determine the underlying factors contributing to any issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_2",
            "question": "A client reports that their cat, Mittens, is exhibiting increased vocalization and destructive scratching. According to the P.U.R.R.S. Framework™, which of the following is the MOST appropriate first step?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend a scratching post and ignore the vocalization.", "Prescribe anti-anxiety medication.", "Assess Mittens' current health, behavior, environment, and the owner's lifestyle.", "Advise the owner to spend more time playing with Mittens."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Profile & Preferences' step of the P.U.R.R.S. Framework™ emphasizes the importance of a thorough assessment of the cat's current health, behavior, environment, and the owner's lifestyle. This initial assessment provides a baseline for understanding the cat's needs and developing a personalized wellness plan."

        {
            "id": "final_3",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of environmental enrichment for indoor cats?",
            "options": ["To eliminate all scratching behavior.", "To reduce the cat's dependence on human interaction.", "To provide opportunities for cats to express their natural behaviors and reduce stress.", "To completely eliminate the need for veterinary care."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Environmental enrichment aims to provide opportunities for cats to engage in natural behaviors such as hunting, scratching, climbing, and exploring, thereby reducing stress, boredom, and behavioral problems. It does not aim to eliminate scratching entirely, but rather to redirect it to appropriate outlets."

        {
            "id": "final_4",
            "question": "A 2023 study by Ellis et al. found that cats prefer food bowls that are:",
            "options": ["Deep and narrow.", "Wide and shallow.", "Made of plastic.", "Elevated significantly above floor level."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ellis et al. (2023) demonstrated that cats generally prefer wide and shallow food bowls, as these do not compress their whiskers and cause whisker fatigue (vibrissae stress). This preference is important to consider when advising clients on appropriate feeding equipment."

            "id": "final_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key consideration when recommending a multi-cat household management strategy?",
            "options": ["Ensuring all cats share the same resources (food, water, litter boxes).", "Forcing cats to interact regularly to establish a hierarchy.", "Providing multiple, separate resources and vertical space to reduce competition and stress.", "Punishing cats for any displays of aggression."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In multi-cat households, it is crucial to provide multiple, separate resources such as food, water, litter boxes, and scratching posts to minimize competition and stress. Vertical space, like cat trees, also allows cats to establish their own territories and avoid unwanted interactions. Punishment is never recommended as it can increase anxiety and aggression."
        },
        {
            "id": "final_6",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of using pheromone therapy (e.g., Feliway) in feline wellness?",
            "options": ["To cure all behavioral problems.", "To mask unpleasant odors in the home.", "To create a sense of security and reduce stress-related behaviors.", "To attract more cats to the household."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Pheromone therapy, such as Feliway, mimics natural feline facial pheromones, which cats use to mark their territory as safe and secure. This can help reduce stress-related behaviors such as urine spraying, scratching, and aggression, creating a more comfortable environment for the cat."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hiding the pill in a palatable treat or using a pill popper are gentle and effective methods for administering oral medication to cats. Forceful methods can cause stress and trauma, while skipping doses or punishing the cat can negatively impact its health and well-being."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senior cats (11+ years) should have veterinary check-ups every six months to monitor for age-related health issues such as kidney disease, arthritis, and hyperthyroidism. More frequent check-ups allow for early detection and management of these conditions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When ethical dilemmas arise, the welfare of the cat should always be the priority. This means advocating for the cat's best interests, even if it conflicts with the owner's preferences. Maintaining client confidentiality and avoiding guarantees are also important ethical considerations."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing inappropriate elimination requires a multi-faceted approach, including cleaning soiled areas with an enzymatic cleaner to remove odors, identifying and addressing any underlying medical conditions (e.g., urinary tract infection), and addressing any behavioral issues such as stress or litter box aversion. Punishment is never recommended as it can worsen the problem."

            "id": "final_12",
            "question": "What is the significance of understanding feline body language in wellness consultations?",
            "options": ["It is irrelevant as cats communicate primarily through vocalization.", "It allows for accurate assessment of the cat's emotional state and identification of potential stressors.", "It is only useful for diagnosing medical conditions.", "It is only important for feral cats, not domestic cats."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Understanding feline body language is crucial for accurately assessing a cat's emotional state and identifying potential stressors. Subtle cues such as ear position, tail movement, and body posture can provide valuable information about the cat's well-being."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Constant begging for food can be a sign of an underlying medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, diabetes) or a nutritionally inadequate diet. It is important to rule out any medical issues and assess the cat's diet to ensure it is meeting their nutritional needs. Ignoring the behavior or giving treats can exacerbate the problem."

            "explanation": "A successful feline weight management program includes a combination of controlled calorie intake, increased physical activity through interactive play and environmental enrichment, and regular monitoring of weight and body condition. Drastic food restriction can be dangerous and lead to health problems."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
