            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "A cat diagnosed with diabetes mellitus presents with persistent hyperglycemia despite insulin therapy. Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST likely to improve glycemic control?",
            "options": ["Increasing carbohydrate content to improve palatability.", "Switching to a diet with high fiber content and moderate protein.", "Implementing a raw food diet with high fat content.", "Offering small, frequent meals of dry kibble throughout the day."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "High-fiber, moderate-protein diets can help regulate blood glucose levels in diabetic cats. Fiber slows glucose absorption, and moderate protein supports muscle mass."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 14-year-old cat diagnosed with Stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibits anorexia and weight loss. What initial nutritional intervention is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Force-feeding a high-protein diet to prevent muscle wasting.", "Offering a renal-specific diet that is palatable and lower in phosphorus and protein.", "Administering subcutaneous fluids only, withholding food until kidney function improves.", "Supplementing with high doses of vitamin D to improve calcium absorption."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Renal-specific diets are formulated to reduce the workload on the kidneys and are often more palatable. Lowering phosphorus and protein helps manage CKD progression. Anorexia is common and should be addressed promptly to avoid further complications."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "Which of the following treatments is generally considered the GOLD standard for managing feline hyperthyroidism?",
            "options": ["Dietary restriction of iodine.", "Oral administration of methimazole.", "Radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy.", "Surgical thyroidectomy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy is often considered the gold standard due to its high success rate and minimal long-term side effects. It selectively destroys hyperactive thyroid tissue."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A cat with recurrent feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is displaying signs of stress-related overgrooming. In addition to dietary and environmental modifications, which of the following behavioral interventions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Punishing the cat for overgrooming to discourage the behavior.", "Providing more attention and playtime to distract the cat.", "Using synthetic feline pheromones (e.g., Feliway) and creating multiple safe spaces.", "Restricting access to grooming to prevent further skin irritation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "FLUTD is often linked to stress. Using pheromones and creating safe spaces can reduce anxiety and overgrooming. Punishment is contraindicated as it increases stress and worsens the problem."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "An 18-year-old cat is exhibiting signs of feline cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS), including disorientation and altered sleep-wake cycles. Which of the following dietary supplements is MOST likely to improve cognitive function?",
            "options": ["Taurine to support cardiac function.", "Omega-3 fatty acids to reduce inflammation and support brain health.", "Vitamin C to boost the immune system.", "Glucosamine to improve joint mobility."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, have been shown to improve cognitive function in aging cats by reducing inflammation and supporting neuronal health. Studies indicate a positive correlation between omega-3 supplementation and improved cognitive scores in cats with CDS."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A cat undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma is experiencing nausea and reduced appetite. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate for managing these side effects?",
            "options": ["Withholding food until the nausea subsides.", "Administering antiemetics (e.g., maropitant) and offering highly palatable, easily digestible food.", "Force-feeding a high-protein diet to maintain muscle mass.", "Increasing the dose of chemotherapy to eliminate the cancer cells faster."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Antiemetics can effectively manage nausea, allowing the cat to eat. Palatable, easily digestible food encourages intake. Force-feeding is stressful and can worsen nausea. Chemotherapy doses should not be increased without veterinary guidance."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a CORE vaccine recommended for ALL cats, regardless of lifestyle?",
            "options": ["Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV).", "Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).", "Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV).", "Chlamydophila felis."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Feline Panleukopenia Virus (FPV) is a core vaccine because the disease is highly contagious and potentially fatal. Core vaccines are recommended for all cats, while non-core vaccines are given based on risk assessment."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "A cat is exhibiting severe anxiety and aggression towards visitors. After ruling out medical causes, which of the following behavior modification techniques is MOST appropriate as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Flooding: Exposing the cat to numerous visitors at once to desensitize it quickly.", "Punishment: Using a spray bottle to deter aggressive behavior.", "Systematic Desensitization and Counterconditioning: Gradually exposing the cat to visitors while pairing their presence with positive reinforcement.", "Ignoring the cat's behavior and hoping it will resolve on its own."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic desensitization and counterconditioning are effective methods for reducing anxiety and aggression. This involves gradually exposing the cat to the stimulus (visitors) while associating it with positive experiences (treats, praise). Flooding and punishment are contraindicated as they can worsen anxiety."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "According to recent studies discussed in the Feline Oncology Support lesson, what percentage of cats with lymphoma experience improved quality of life with palliative care alone?",
            "options": ["Less than 10%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 50%", "Over 75%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 50% of cats with lymphoma can experience an improved quality of life with palliative care, including pain management and nutritional support, even without aggressive chemotherapy."

            "question": "A cat with a history of FLUTD is now urinating outside the litter box and showing signs of discomfort. The owner reports using a scented litter. What is the FIRST step you should recommend?",
            "options": ["Administer antibiotics immediately.", "Switch to an unscented, clumping litter and increase the number of litter boxes.", "Recommend a urinary acidifier supplement.", "Advise the owner to confine the cat to a smaller area."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Scented litters can be aversive to cats and contribute to litter box avoidance. Switching to an unscented, clumping litter and increasing the number of boxes are essential first steps. Antibiotics should only be used if a bacterial infection is confirmed by a veterinarian."
