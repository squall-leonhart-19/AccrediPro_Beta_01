            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The PURRS framework emphasizes a holistic approach. Assessing Pain, Understanding Resources, Relationships, and Safety/Security allows for a comprehensive understanding of the cat's overall well-being and how each aspect influences the other conditions."

            "options": ["A high-fiber diet to promote gut motility.", "A diet restricted in magnesium, phosphorus, and protein.", "A novel protein diet with added omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics.", "A completely raw food diet to eliminate processed ingredients."],

            "explanation": "FIC is often triggered by stress. Environmental enrichment aims to reduce stress and anxiety, which can help to minimize flare-ups of the condition. A 2016 study in the *Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery* demonstrated a significant reduction in FIC symptoms with increased environmental enrichment (Buffington, 2016)."
