            "options": ["To eliminate all distress and suffering.", "To restore the client to their pre-crisis level of functioning.", "To prolong life at all costs.", "To provide immediate comfort and then connect clients with appropriate resources for long-term support."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Dismiss their feelings as normal grief.", "Immediately call emergency services.", "Engage in active listening and assess their level of distress and protective factors.", "Tell them that everything will be alright."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even without an active plan, suicidal ideation requires careful assessment. Active listening, exploring their feelings, and identifying protective factors are crucial first steps before determining the need for further intervention. A 2021 study in 'Palliative Medicine' showed that early intervention significantly reduces risk."
