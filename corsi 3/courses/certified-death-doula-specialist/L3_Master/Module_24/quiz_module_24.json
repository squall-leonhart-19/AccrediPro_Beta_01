            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective advanced communication technique for uncovering a client's unspoken fears surrounding death?",
            "options": ["Direct questioning about fears.", "Using reflective listening and open-ended questions to explore underlying emotions.", "Offering immediate reassurance and solutions.", "Sharing personal anecdotes about death and dying."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reflective listening and open-ended questions allow the client to explore their feelings at their own pace, fostering trust and revealing deeper concerns. Direct questioning can be confrontational and shut down communication."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While respecting family dynamics is important, the client's autonomy and right to information take precedence. Encouraging open communication within the family is the most ethical approach. As covered in L2, the client's autonomy is paramount."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
