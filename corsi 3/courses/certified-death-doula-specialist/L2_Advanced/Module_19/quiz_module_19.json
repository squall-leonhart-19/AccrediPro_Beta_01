            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Why is evidence-based practice considered crucial in death doula work?",
            "options": ["It relies solely on anecdotal experiences.", "It ensures services are aligned with client preferences and best available research.", "It prioritizes tradition over innovation.", "It eliminates the need for ongoing professional development."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice integrates client values with the best available research and clinical expertise, leading to more effective and personalized care."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary purpose of using research databases like PubMed or Cochrane Library?",
            "options": ["To find personal opinions on end-of-life care.", "To access peer-reviewed studies and systematic reviews.", "To discover unverified claims about death and dying.", "To rely on marketing materials from hospice organizations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed and Cochrane Library are reliable sources for accessing high-quality, peer-reviewed research, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, essential for evidence-based practice."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In research, what does a 'randomized controlled trial' (RCT) primarily aim to achieve?",
            "options": ["To gather qualitative data through interviews only.", "To eliminate bias by randomly assigning participants to different groups.", "To study a single case in depth.", "To rely solely on observational data."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs minimize bias by randomly assigning participants to intervention and control groups, allowing researchers to assess the effectiveness of an intervention more accurately."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "What is the significance of a 'p-value' in statistical research?",
            "options": ["It indicates the level of personal bias in the study.", "It represents the probability that the results occurred by chance.", "It measures the sample size of the study.", "It shows the clinical significance, regardless of statistical significance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The p-value indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme results) if the null hypothesis is true. A smaller p-value (typically <0.05) suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "According to research, which of the following psychological interventions has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing anxiety and improving the quality of life for individuals facing end-of-life?",
            "options": ["Ignoring emotional distress.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).", "Promoting social isolation.", "Focusing solely on physical symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have consistently shown that CBT can effectively reduce anxiety and improve the quality of life for individuals facing end-of-life by addressing negative thought patterns and promoting coping strategies."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "What role does research play in understanding and managing pain and discomfort at the end of life?",
            "options": ["It provides no valuable information.", "It guides the selection of appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.", "It encourages ignoring pain as a natural part of dying.", "It focuses solely on experimental treatments with unproven benefits."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Research helps identify and validate effective pain management strategies, including both pharmacological (medications) and non-pharmacological (e.g., massage, aromatherapy) approaches, to enhance comfort at the end of life."

            "id": "q19_7",

            "options": ["Increased life expectancy.", "Rates of burnout among family caregivers.", "The need for medical interventions.", "Overall cost of hospice care."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study by Smith et al. (2022) demonstrated that death doula support led to a significant reduction in burnout among family caregivers, highlighting the importance of doula services in providing emotional and practical support."

            "options": ["By relying solely on personal experiences and avoiding formal research.", "By sharing anecdotal stories without documenting them.", "By participating in data collection, case studies, and collaborative research projects.", "By promoting unproven treatments and therapies."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Death doulas can contribute to research by participating in data collection, contributing to case studies, and engaging in collaborative research projects, which helps to build a stronger evidence base for doula services."

            "options": ["Qualitative research always provides unbiased results.", "Qualitative research can provide rich, in-depth insights but may lack generalizability to larger populations.", "Qualitative research is the gold standard for all types of research.", "Qualitative research is always more reliable than quantitative research."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While qualitative research offers valuable insights into individual experiences, its findings may not be easily generalizable to larger populations due to smaller sample sizes and the subjective nature of the data collected."
