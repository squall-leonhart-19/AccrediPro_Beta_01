            "question": "When adapting a ritual for a client with advanced dementia, which of the following is the MOST important consideration, according to best practices?",
            "options": ["Maintaining complex symbolism", "Ensuring strict adherence to traditional practices", "Focusing on sensory engagement and simple, repetitive actions", "Prioritizing intellectual understanding of the ritual's meaning"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with dementia benefit most from simplified rituals that emphasize sensory experiences, such as touch, sound, and familiar objects, rather than complex cognitive engagement. A 2021 study in the 'American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease & Other Dementias' showed a significant reduction in agitation with sensory-based ritual adaptations."

            "question": "In a family experiencing significant conflict regarding end-of-life decisions for a loved one, what is the death doula's primary role?",
            "options": ["To advocate for the client's preferred medical treatment", "To mediate the conflict and impose a solution", "To facilitate open communication and help the family reach a consensus", "To provide legal advice regarding guardianship and power of attorney"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The death doula acts as a facilitator, creating a safe space for family members to express their feelings and work towards a mutually agreeable decision. A case study presented in the lesson highlighted a family where facilitated communication led to a peaceful resolution after weeks of intense disagreement."

            "question": "Which sensory experience is MOST directly linked to feelings of safety and grounding, making it particularly useful in creating a sacred space?",
            "options": ["Visual stimulation with bright colors", "Aromatic scents like lavender or chamomile", "Auditory experiences like loud music", "Gustatory experiences with strong flavors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aromatic scents, particularly those associated with calmness and relaxation, have a strong neurological link to feelings of safety and grounding. Research published in 'Psychoneuroendocrinology' in 2018 demonstrated the calming effects of lavender on the limbic system."

            "id": "q11_4",
            "question": "What is the KEY difference between active listening and empathetic presence?",
            "options": ["Active listening involves only verbal communication, while empathetic presence is non-verbal.", "Active listening focuses on understanding the speaker's words, while empathetic presence focuses on understanding their emotions.", "Active listening requires offering solutions, while empathetic presence requires withholding judgment.", "There is no significant difference; the terms are interchangeable."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Active listening primarily concerns itself with comprehending the literal message being conveyed, whereas empathetic presence goes beyond the words to connect with the speaker's emotional state and underlying feelings. Empathetic presence is often communicated non-verbally through body language and tone."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client expresses intense fear of the unknown and the process of dying. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate for addressing this existential distress?",
            "options": ["Administering an anti-anxiety medication", "Engaging in a detailed discussion about funeral arrangements", "Exploring the client's values, beliefs, and sources of meaning", "Reassuring the client that everything will be alright"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Existential distress often stems from a lack of meaning or purpose. Exploring the client's values and beliefs can help them find peace and acceptance. A 2022 study in the 'Journal of Palliative Medicine' found that meaning-centered psychotherapy significantly reduced existential distress in end-of-life patients."

            "options": ["Providing emotional support to the dying person and their family", "Offering guidance on funeral planning and memorial services", "Administering medication or providing medical advice", "Creating personalized rituals and ceremonies"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Death doulas are not medical professionals and should never provide medical advice or administer medication. Their role is to provide emotional, spiritual, and practical support within the boundaries of their training and expertise. Offering medical advice violates ethical guidelines and potentially endangers the client."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the S.O.U.L.S. Framework™, 'L' stands for Legacy, referring to the client's desire to leave behind a meaningful contribution or memory. Addressing legacy concerns can provide comfort and a sense of purpose during the end-of-life journey. Documenting life stories is a key component."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Retaining approximately 50-60% of the original structure provides a balance between familiarity and personalization. This allows the ritual to be meaningful and relevant to the individual while still offering a sense of comfort and connection to tradition. The exact percentage may vary depending on the client's needs and preferences."
