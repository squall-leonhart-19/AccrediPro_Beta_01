            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of somatic sequencing, as it relates to polyvagal-informed movement?",
            "options": [
                "A random series of physical exercises designed to fatigue the body and promote relaxation.",
                "A structured progression of movements designed to gently explore and reorganize patterns of neuromuscular holding related to specific emotional or traumatic experiences.",
                "Repetitive movements performed until the individual feels emotionally triggered, at which point the exercise is stopped.",
                "A series of stretches held for extended periods to increase flexibility and range of motion."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Somatic sequencing involves a deliberate progression of movements to address neuromuscular holding patterns associated with emotional or traumatic experiences, promoting reorganization and integration."

            "question": "A client reports feeling consistently 'stuck' in a sympathetic state (fight-or-flight). Which advanced breathwork technique would be MOST appropriate to initially downregulate their nervous system?",
            "options": [
                "Box breathing with a 4:4:4:4 ratio (inhale:hold:exhale:hold).",
                "Kapalabhati breathing (rapid, forceful exhalations).",
                "Prolonged exhale breathing with a 4:6 ratio (inhale:exhale).",
                "Breath retention exercises (holding the breath after inhalation)."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prolonged exhale breathing stimulates the vagus nerve and promotes parasympathetic activation, helping to shift the nervous system out of the sympathetic state. Studies suggest even a 4:6 ratio can make a difference."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that low-frequency sound waves in the 30-60 Hz range are most effective for promoting relaxation and pain reduction due to their ability to stimulate mechanoreceptors and influence the autonomic nervous system."
