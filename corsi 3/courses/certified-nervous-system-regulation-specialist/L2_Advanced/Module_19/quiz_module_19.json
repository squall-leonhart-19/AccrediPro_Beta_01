            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes evidence-based practice (EBP) in the context of nervous system regulation?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on personal experience and intuition when treating clients.", "Integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and client values.", "Following treatment protocols exactly as written, regardless of individual client needs.", "Ignoring research findings and focusing on anecdotal evidence."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP involves a synthesis of research, clinical expertise, and client values to inform treatment decisions."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is considered a strong research design because it:",
            "options": ["Guarantees statistically significant results.", "Eliminates the need for ethical review.", "Minimizes bias through random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups.", "Only includes participants who are likely to respond to the intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Random assignment helps to ensure that differences between groups are due to the intervention and not pre-existing factors."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what is the approximate effect size (Cohen's d) of breathwork interventions on reducing anxiety symptoms, based on a meta-analysis of several studies?",
            "options": ["d = 0.1 (negligible effect)", "d = 0.3 (small effect)", "d = 0.6 (moderate effect)", "d = 1.2 (very large effect)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses suggest that breathwork interventions generally have a moderate effect size (around d = 0.6) on reducing anxiety."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the case study involving 'Sarah,' a 35-year-old client with chronic anxiety, which grounding technique was reported to be most effective in immediately reducing her anxiety symptoms?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation", "5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise", "Diaphragmatic breathing", "Guided visualization"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise was highlighted as particularly effective for Sarah in managing acute anxiety symptoms by engaging her senses and redirecting her attention."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key component of Polyvagal Theory that explains the hierarchical response to perceived threats?",
            "options": ["The parasympathetic nervous system is always dominant.", "The sympathetic nervous system is solely responsible for social engagement.", "The vagus nerve has two branches: the myelinated ventral vagal and the unmyelinated dorsal vagal.", "The dorsal vagal pathway promotes social connection and communication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Polyvagal Theory emphasizes the two branches of the vagus nerve and their roles in social engagement (ventral vagal) and immobilization (dorsal vagal)."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Research on mindfulness and meditation suggests that regular practice can lead to increased activity in which brain region associated with emotional regulation?",
            "options": ["Amygdala", "Hippocampus", "Prefrontal cortex", "Cerebellum"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that mindfulness and meditation can strengthen the prefrontal cortex, improving its ability to regulate emotions."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "What is a key difference between a systematic review and a meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["A systematic review uses statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies, while a meta-analysis does not.", "A meta-analysis uses statistical methods to combine the results of multiple studies, while a systematic review provides a qualitative summary of the evidence.", "A systematic review is always conducted before a meta-analysis.", "A meta-analysis is a type of case study, while a systematic review is a literature review."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systematic review summarizes the findings of multiple studies, while a meta-analysis uses statistical techniques to combine the results quantitatively."

            "options": ["Cognition, Action, Learning, Memory", "Connection, Awareness, Lifestyle, Movement", "Control, Acceptance, Letting go, Mindfulness", "Communication, Assessment, Listening, Motivation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CALM framework focuses on Connection, Awareness, Lifestyle, and Movement as crucial components for effective nervous system regulation."

            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'waitlist control group' in a research study?",
            "options": ["To receive the intervention immediately.", "To control for the placebo effect.", "To receive the intervention after the initial treatment period for the active group.", "To receive a different, less effective intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A waitlist control group helps researchers compare outcomes to those receiving immediate intervention, while still offering the intervention eventually."
