        {
            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "In trauma-informed care, what is the MOST important initial step when working with a complex client?",
            "options": ["Immediately addressing traumatic memories.", "Establishing safety and trust.", "Implementing advanced nervous system regulation techniques.", "Gathering a detailed trauma history."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing safety and trust is paramount in trauma-informed care. Addressing traumatic memories or implementing advanced techniques before safety is established can be re-traumatizing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of anxiety and depression alongside chronic pain. According to the lesson, which neurotransmitter system is MOST likely implicated in this co-occurrence?",
            "options": ["GABAergic system.", "Dopaminergic system.", "Serotonergic system.", "Glutamatergic system."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The serotonergic system plays a crucial role in mood regulation and pain modulation. Dysfunction in this system is often implicated in co-occurring anxiety, depression, and chronic pain."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "You are working with a client with sensory processing sensitivities who becomes overwhelmed during a session. What is the MOST appropriate immediate intervention?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to push through the discomfort.", "Remove them from the sensory environment.", "Provide a grounding exercise, such as focusing on their breath or a specific object.", "Ask them to describe their feelings in detail."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises help to bring the client back to the present moment and regulate their nervous system. Removing them from the sensory environment is also helpful but grounding is often more immediately accessible."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "According to attachment theory, clients with disorganized attachment styles often exhibit which of the following behaviors in therapeutic relationships?",
            "options": ["Consistent need for reassurance.", "Difficulty trusting the therapist.", "Alternating between seeking closeness and pushing away.", "Idealizing the therapist."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Disorganized attachment is characterized by inconsistent and unpredictable behavior, often involving a push-pull dynamic in relationships due to unresolved trauma and fear."

        {
            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "A client with a history of addiction is experiencing intense cravings. Using the C.A.L.M. Framework™, which step would MOST directly address the craving?",
            "options": ["Connecting with supportive relationships.", "Acknowledging the craving without judgment.", "Locating the physical sensations associated with the craving.", "Managing environmental triggers."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Locating the physical sensations associated with the craving helps the client to become more aware of their body and to regulate their nervous system response to the craving, a core component of the C.A.L.M. framework."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY ethical consideration when working with clients who have complex trauma histories?",
            "options": ["Maintaining strict professional boundaries.", "Ensuring client confidentiality.", "Avoiding re-traumatization.", "Providing a diagnosis within the first session."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Avoiding re-traumatization is a paramount ethical consideration. Therapists must be mindful of their approach and techniques to prevent triggering past trauma."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, 35, reports chronic fatigue, anxiety, and a history of childhood emotional neglect. Her affect is often flat, and she struggles to express her emotions. Which nervous system regulation technique would be MOST appropriate to introduce FIRST?",
            "options": ["Polyvagal exercises focusing on social engagement.", "Somatic experiencing to process past trauma.", "Simple grounding exercises, such as mindful breathing.", "Exposure therapy to address her anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's flat affect and difficulty expressing emotions, starting with simple grounding exercises is the most appropriate first step. This will help her to connect with her body and regulate her nervous system before moving on to more complex techniques."

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "A 2023 study by Jones et al. found that mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduced pain perception in patients with fibromyalgia. What percentage reduction in pain scores was observed, on average?",
            "options": ["10%", "25%", "40%", "55%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2023 study by Jones et al. reported an average reduction of 40% in pain scores among fibromyalgia patients who participated in mindfulness-based interventions, highlighting the potential of these techniques for chronic pain management."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Individuals with SPD typically have a decreased pain tolerance, not an increased one. They may be overly sensitive to stimuli that others find mild."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
