            "options": ["Selecting specific somatic interventions", "Conducting a thorough client assessment", "Establishing clear treatment goals", "Reviewing the client's insurance coverage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A thorough client assessment, including history, symptoms, and contributing factors, forms the foundation for effective treatment planning. Without it, interventions may be misdirected."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) is specifically designed to screen for symptoms of posttraumatic stress and is therefore the most appropriate initial tool in this scenario."

            "options": ["Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)", "Mindfulness and breathwork techniques", "Polyvagal exercises", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness and breathwork techniques are generally considered Tier 1 interventions due to their accessibility, low risk, and potential for broad application in promoting nervous system regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Feldenkrais Method emphasizes gentle movement and awareness to reorganize patterns of movement and reduce muscular tension, promoting nervous system regulation."

            "options": ["Immediately discontinue somatic interventions.", "Refer the client to a psychiatrist for medication evaluation.", "Consult with a colleague specializing in trauma-informed care.", "Increase the frequency of somatic intervention sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Consulting with a colleague specializing in trauma-informed care allows for a fresh perspective and potential modifications to the treatment plan based on their expertise. This approach aligns with collaborative practice and ensures the client receives the most appropriate care."
