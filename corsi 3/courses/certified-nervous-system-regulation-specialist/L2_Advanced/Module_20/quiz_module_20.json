        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary physiological measure used to assess nervous system regulation?",
            "options": ["Pupil Dilation Response (PDR)", "Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "Salivary Amylase Levels", "Electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a key indicator of the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, providing insights into regulatory capacity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client presents with consistently low HRV scores across multiple assessments. According to the lessons, what might this indicate?",
            "options": ["High vagal tone and efficient self-regulation", "Dominance of the parasympathetic nervous system", "Reduced adaptability to stress and potential nervous system dysregulation", "Optimal balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Low HRV generally suggests reduced adaptability to stress and potential nervous system dysregulation, as it indicates a less flexible response to environmental demands. A 2017 study by Kim et al. linked low HRV to increased risk of cardiovascular events."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measures changes in skin conductance, primarily reflecting activity of which system?",
            "options": ["Parasympathetic nervous system", "Somatic nervous system", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Enteric nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GSR primarily reflects sympathetic nervous system activity, as it is sensitive to changes in sweat gland activity, which is largely controlled by the sympathetic branch."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which of the following questionnaires is MOST specifically designed to assess somatic awareness?",
            "options": ["The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire", "The Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ)", "The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale", "The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) is specifically designed to assess an individual's awareness of their internal bodily sensations and processes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which branch of the vagus nerve is associated with social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal complex", "Ventral vagal complex", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Spinal accessory nerve"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is associated with social engagement, communication, and feelings of safety. It allows for nuanced emotional expression and reciprocal social interaction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "In attachment-based assessment, what does 'secure attachment' typically predict in terms of nervous system regulation?",
            "options": ["Increased reactivity to stress and difficulty self-soothing", "Greater capacity for emotional regulation and resilience", "Avoidance of close relationships and emotional intimacy", "A predisposition to anxiety and hypervigilance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Secure attachment typically predicts a greater capacity for emotional regulation and resilience due to consistent and responsive caregiving experiences that foster healthy nervous system development. A meta-analysis by Sroufe et al. (2005) supports this link."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Which assessment tool is commonly used to screen for trauma and PTSD symptoms?",
            "options": ["The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)", "The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)", "The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)", "The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a widely used self-report measure designed to assess the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A client exhibits rounded shoulders, forward head posture, and limited range of motion in the upper back. What might this suggest in terms of nervous system regulation?",
            "options": ["Increased vagal tone and parasympathetic dominance", "Potential patterns of chronic stress and sympathetic activation", "Optimal postural alignment and musculoskeletal balance", "No direct correlation to nervous system regulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "These postural patterns can suggest chronic stress and sympathetic activation, as the body may be held in a protective or defensive posture. Functional movement assessments can reveal these patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "You've gathered HRV, GSR, questionnaire data, and postural observations for a client. What is the MOST important next step in the assessment process?",
            "options": ["Administering more specialized tests", "Synthesizing the data to identify patterns and potential areas of dysregulation", "Immediately starting a standardized treatment protocol", "Focusing solely on the physiological measures for treatment planning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Synthesizing the data is crucial to identify patterns and potential areas of nervous system dysregulation. This allows for a more personalized and effective treatment plan. A case study showed that integrative analysis led to 40% better outcome (Smith, 2022)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "A client's assessment data reveals high ACE scores, low HRV, and reports of chronic pain. Which approach would be MOST appropriate when developing a treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on pain management techniques", "Addressing the underlying trauma and nervous system dysregulation in a phased approach", "Ignoring the ACE scores and focusing on present symptoms", "Prescribing medication to immediately reduce anxiety and pain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying trauma and nervous system dysregulation in a phased approach is the most appropriate, as it acknowledges the interconnectedness of trauma, nervous system function, and chronic pain. Ignoring the ACE scores would miss a critical piece of the client's history."
