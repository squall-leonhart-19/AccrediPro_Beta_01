            "id": "q5_1",
            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which of the following is the primary function of the <span class=\"highlight\">ventral vagal pathway</span>?",
            "options": ["Fight-or-flight response", "Social engagement and connection", "Immobilization and conservation of energy", "Digestive processes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal pathway is responsible for social engagement, communication, and creating a sense of safety and connection with others."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes <span class=\"highlight\">neuroception</span>?",
            "options": ["Conscious perception of environmental threats", "The body's unconscious assessment of safety and danger", "A cognitive evaluation of social interactions", "A learned response to specific stimuli"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neuroception is an unconscious process where the nervous system scans the environment for cues of safety and danger, without conscious awareness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic anxiety and difficulty forming close relationships. Based on Polyvagal Theory, which part of their nervous system is MOST likely dysregulated?",
            "options": ["Dorsal vagal pathway", "Sympathetic nervous system", "Ventral vagal pathway", "Parasympathetic nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Difficulty forming close relationships often indicates a dysregulated ventral vagal pathway, hindering social engagement and connection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_4",
            "question": "In the context of trauma, the <span class=\"highlight\">dorsal vagal pathway</span> can lead to which of the following responses?",
            "options": ["Hypervigilance", "Dissociation and shutdown", "Aggression", "Increased social engagement"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the face of overwhelming threat, the dorsal vagal pathway can trigger a state of immobilization, dissociation, and shutdown as a survival mechanism."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of <span class=\"highlight\">co-regulation</span>?",
            "options": ["A person independently managing their anxiety through deep breathing", "An infant calming down when held and soothed by a caregiver", "An individual avoiding social situations to minimize stress", "A person using medication to regulate their mood"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Co-regulation involves regulating one's nervous system through interaction with another person. An infant being soothed by a caregiver is a prime example."

        {
            "id": "q5_6",
            "question": "According to Porges (2011), what is the correct order of the nervous system's defensive strategies, from most to least evolutionarily advanced?",
            "options": ["Social Engagement, Fight-or-Flight, Freeze", "Fight-or-Flight, Social Engagement, Freeze", "Freeze, Fight-or-Flight, Social Engagement", "Social Engagement, Freeze, Fight-or-Flight"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Porges' Polyvagal Theory suggests that social engagement is the most evolved response, followed by fight-or-flight (sympathetic activation), and finally, freeze (dorsal vagal shutdown)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "A client is experiencing chronic pain and fatigue. Which branch of the autonomic nervous system is MOST likely dominant, according to Polyvagal Theory?",
            "options": ["Ventral Vagal", "Sympathetic", "Dorsal Vagal", "Somatic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic pain and fatigue can often be associated with a dominant dorsal vagal state, characterized by low energy and immobilization."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_8",
            "question": "Within the CALM framework for integrating Polyvagal Theory into clinical practice, what does the 'L' represent?",
            "options": ["Listening", "Learning", "Labeling", "Linking"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the CALM framework, 'L' stands for 'Listening' to the client's story and observing their nonverbal cues to understand their nervous system state."

        {
            "id": "q5_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study by Smith et al. found that interventions targeting the <span class=\"highlight\">ventral vagal pathway</span> resulted in a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">35% reduction</span> in symptoms of which condition?",
            "options": ["PTSD", "Social Anxiety Disorder", "Generalized Anxiety Disorder", "Depression"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Smith et al. (2023) found that interventions such as mindfulness and social skills training, which target the ventral vagal pathway, significantly reduced symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder."

        {
            "id": "q5_10",
            "question": "Which of the following interventions would be MOST effective in activating a client's <span class=\"highlight\">social engagement system</span>?",
            "options": ["Encouraging solitary meditation", "Recommending intense physical exercise", "Facilitating eye contact and shared storytelling in a safe environment", "Prescribing medication to reduce anxiety"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The social engagement system is activated through connection and communication. Facilitating eye contact and shared storytelling in a safe environment will promote feelings of safety and connection."
