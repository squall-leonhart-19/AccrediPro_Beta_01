            "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)?",
            "options": ["Voluntary muscle control", "Regulation of internal organ functions", "Cognitive processing", "Sensory perception"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ANS primarily regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration."

            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During a stressful situation, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activates the 'fight or flight' response. Which physiological change is LEAST likely to occur?",
            "options": ["Increased heart rate", "Pupil dilation", "Increased digestion", "Release of glucose from the liver"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SNS inhibits digestion during stress to prioritize energy for immediate survival actions."

            "id": "q9_3",
            "question": "The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is often referred to as the 'rest and digest' system. Which neurotransmitter is primarily associated with PNS activity?",
            "options": ["Norepinephrine", "Epinephrine", "Acetylcholine", "Dopamine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and digestion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body, including sensations like hunger, pain, and heart rate."

            "options": ["To immediately implement regulation strategies", "To establish rapport and understand the client's experience", "To assess the client's physiological responses", "To challenge the client's beliefs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Connect & Clarify' stage focuses on building a therapeutic relationship and gaining a clear understanding of the client's perspective and needs."

            "options": ["Instruct the client to take deep breaths immediately", "Acknowledge and validate the client's observed state of dysregulation", "Challenge the client's thoughts about the situation", "Ignore the symptoms and proceed with the planned intervention"],

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing and mindfulness practices can help to increase HRV and promote relaxation, addressing both anxiety and sleep issues."

            "question": "A 2023 study by Thompson et al. found that individuals with higher levels of somatic awareness experienced a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30% reduction</span> in anxiety symptoms compared to those with lower awareness. How can this finding inform your practice?",
            "options": ["Prioritize cognitive restructuring techniques over somatic practices", "Encourage clients to develop somatic awareness through practices like body scans and mindful movement", "Avoid discussing bodily sensations with clients who have anxiety", "Focus solely on medication management for anxiety symptoms"],
