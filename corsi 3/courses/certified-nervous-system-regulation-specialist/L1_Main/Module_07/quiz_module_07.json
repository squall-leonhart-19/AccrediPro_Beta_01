            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which neural platform is associated with social engagement and feeling safe?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Complex", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Ventral Vagal Complex", "Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is responsible for social engagement, communication, and feeling safe and connected to others. It inhibits the fight-or-flight responses of the Sympathetic Nervous System and the freeze response of the Dorsal Vagal Complex."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration in Somatic Experiencing® involves gradually exposing a client to traumatic memories in a controlled and supportive environment, allowing them to process the trauma in manageable doses."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Interoception is the sense of the internal state of the body, including visceral sensations such as heartbeat, breathing, and digestion. It plays a crucial role in emotional regulation and self-awareness."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Porges' research highlights that the social engagement system, mediated by the ventral vagal nerve, is primarily responsible for promoting connection, communication, and feelings of safety, thereby reducing perceived threat."
