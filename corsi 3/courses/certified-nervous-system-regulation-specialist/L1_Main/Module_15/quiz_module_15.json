            "question": "According to Polyvagal Theory, which neural circuit is MOST associated with social engagement and feelings of safety?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Complex", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Ventral Vagal Complex", "Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ventral Vagal Complex is responsible for social engagement, facial expression, vocalization, and feeling safe and connected."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "In Somatic Experiencing, what is 'titration' primarily used for?",
            "options": ["To immediately release all traumatic energy at once.", "To gradually expose the client to the full intensity of the traumatic memory.", "To help clients gradually access and process traumatic material in manageable amounts.", "To completely avoid any discussion of the traumatic event."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration involves gently accessing small amounts of trauma-related activation, allowing the nervous system to process and discharge it gradually, preventing overwhelm and re-traumatization. This aligns with Levine's (1997) emphasis on building resilience."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoception involves sensing internal bodily signals. Focusing on the breath is a direct way to enhance awareness of these internal sensations."

            "options": ["The brain's ability to change solely due to genetic factors.", "The brain's ability to reorganize itself based on experiences and learning.", "The brain's fixed structure that cannot be altered after childhood.", "The brain's response to traumatic events, always resulting in negative changes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "Which statement is MOST accurate regarding the relationship between interoception and emotional regulation?",
            "options": ["Interoception has no impact on emotional regulation.", "Greater interoceptive awareness always leads to improved emotional regulation.", "Reduced interoceptive awareness is always linked to mental health conditions.", "Enhanced interoceptive awareness can improve the ability to identify and regulate emotions, but is not always sufficient."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that enhanced interoceptive awareness can facilitate emotional regulation by improving the ability to recognize and respond to internal emotional cues. However, other factors, such as coping skills and social support, also play crucial roles."
