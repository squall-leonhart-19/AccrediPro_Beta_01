            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The ventral vagal pathway is primarily responsible for social engagement, communication, and creating a sense of safety and connection with others, as highlighted in advanced Polyvagal Theory."

            "options": ["Kapalabhati breathing (Skull Shining Breath)", "Box breathing (Equal Breathing)", "Bhastrika breathing (Bellows Breath)", "Ujjayi breathing (Ocean Breath)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Box breathing, or equal breathing, is highly effective for down-regulating the nervous system during a panic attack. It involves inhaling, holding the breath, exhaling, and holding again for equal counts, promoting a sense of calm and balance."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interoceptive awareness practices primarily focus on enhancing the awareness of internal bodily sensations and signals, such as heart rate, breath, and muscle tension, allowing for better self-regulation."
