            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "Which advanced breathwork technique focuses on creating a coherent heart rhythm to enhance vagal tone and promote relaxation?",
            "options": ["Box Breathing", "Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)", "Coherent Breathing", "Diaphragmatic Breathing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Coherent breathing, typically involving 5-6 breaths per minute, aims to synchronize heart rate variability (HRV) and promote a state of physiological coherence, thereby enhancing vagal tone and relaxation."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In Somatic Experiencing, <span class=\"highlight\">titration</span> refers to what process?",
            "options": ["Completely flooding the client with traumatic memories to expedite processing.", "Gradually exposing the client to manageable fragments of the trauma.", "Administering medication to reduce anxiety during trauma processing.", "Using hypnosis to uncover repressed memories."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Titration involves gradually exposing the client to manageable fragments of the traumatic experience, allowing the nervous system to process the trauma in a controlled and safe manner."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Humming stimulates the vagus nerve through sound vibrations, which can help to increase vagal tone and promote relaxation. This is thought to work by activating the muscles in the throat and vocal cords that are connected to the vagus nerve."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary components is MOST directly linked to the production of serotonin in the gut, impacting mood and nervous system function?",
            "options": ["Saturated Fats", "Tryptophan", "Gluten", "Refined Sugars"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that serves as a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter crucial for mood regulation and nervous system function. A deficiency in tryptophan can impair serotonin production."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of trauma reports feeling overwhelmed by interoceptive awareness during a body scan meditation. What modification is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encourage the client to push through the discomfort to build resilience.", "Suggest the client focus on external sounds or sensations instead.", "Advise the client to immediately stop the meditation and avoid body scans in the future.", "Administer a sedative to reduce anxiety during the exercise."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "If a client feels overwhelmed by interoceptive awareness, shifting the focus to external sensations (e.g., sounds) can provide a sense of grounding and safety, preventing further dysregulation. This allows for a more gradual and controlled exploration of internal sensations."
