            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary goal of somatic awareness in nervous system regulation?",
            "options": ["Increasing interoceptive awareness", "Identifying patterns of tension and holding", "Directly suppressing unpleasant sensations", "Enhancing the client's ability to self-regulate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal is not to suppress sensations, but to understand and work with them. Suppression can reinforce dysregulation patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client scores high on the 'Hyperarousal' subscale of a self-assessment questionnaire. This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Predominant parasympathetic nervous system activation", "Chronic under-activation of the sympathetic nervous system", "An overactive sympathetic nervous system response", "Balanced autonomic nervous system function"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperarousal is directly linked to an overactive sympathetic nervous system, leading to heightened alertness and reactivity."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "During a body scan, a client reports a 'numb' sensation in their legs. According to somatic experiencing principles, this could be indicative of which state?",
            "options": ["Fight", "Flight", "Freeze", "Fawn"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Numbness often correlates with the freeze response, where the body shuts down sensation to conserve energy and avoid further perceived threat."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "When observing a client's movement, a practitioner notices consistently shallow breathing and a rigid posture. Which nervous system state might this suggest?",
            "options": ["Dorsal Vagal Activation", "Ventral Vagal Activation", "Sympathetic Activation", "Parasympathetic Activation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Shallow breathing and rigidity are common indicators of sympathetic activation (fight or flight), as the body prepares for action and restricts unnecessary movement."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing anxiety primarily when around large crowds. This is an example of what type of trigger?",
            "options": ["Internal Trigger", "Somatic Trigger", "External Trigger", "Emotional Trigger"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Large crowds are an external stimulus that consistently provokes an anxiety response in this client, making it an external trigger."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a defining characteristic of the 'fawn' response?",
            "options": ["Aggression and confrontation", "Seeking safety through compliance and appeasement", "Withdrawal and isolation", "Hyperactivity and impulsivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The fawn response involves prioritizing the needs and desires of others to avoid conflict and seek safety through compliance."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "According to the lesson, what percentage of individuals experiencing chronic pain also report symptoms of nervous system dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that around 80% of individuals with chronic pain also exhibit signs of nervous system dysregulation, highlighting the strong connection between the two."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client states, 'I know I shouldn't feel this way.' What is the MOST appropriate response from a practitioner emphasizing acknowledgment?",
            "options": ["'You're right, there's no reason to feel that way.'", "'Let's focus on changing those thoughts.'", "'It makes sense that you feel that way, given what you've experienced.'", "'Try to think more positively.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating the client's feelings by acknowledging the connection between their feelings and experiences is a core principle of acknowledgment."

            "question": "In the case study of 'Sarah,' a 35-year-old with chronic anxiety, which intervention proved MOST effective in regulating her nervous system?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) alone", "Medication management alone", "A combination of body scan techniques and mindful movement", "Exposure therapy alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sarah's case study highlighted the effectiveness of integrating body scan techniques and mindful movement to help her connect with her body and regulate her anxiety."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Integrating assessment and acknowledgment, what is the NEXT best step after identifying a client's primary nervous system state (e.g., chronic fight/flight)?",
            "options": ["Immediately implementing advanced trauma resolution techniques", "Teaching the client to suppress their physiological responses", "Collaboratively developing personalized strategies to promote safety and regulation", "Focusing solely on cognitive restructuring"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The goal is to work collaboratively with the client to create a safe and personalized approach to promote regulation, rather than forcing change or solely focusing on cognitive aspects."
