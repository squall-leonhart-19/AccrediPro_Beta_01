            "question": "A client reports difficulty identifying their emotions. Which interoceptive exercise would be MOST beneficial to begin with?",
            "options": ["Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Biofeedback", "Body Scan Meditation", "Emotional Labeling during intense activity", "Mindful Movement focusing on subtle shifts in posture"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A body scan meditation cultivates awareness of bodily sensations without judgment, providing a foundational step for recognizing and understanding the connection between physical sensations and emotional states. Starting with subtle awareness is important before moving to more intense activities."

            "options": ["The Pulmonary Artery", "The Gut-Brain Axis via the vagus nerve", "The Lymphatic System", "Direct diffusion across the blood-brain barrier"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Gut-Brain Axis facilitates bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain, with the vagus nerve serving as a major conduit for transmitting signals related to inflammation, neurotransmitter production, and immune responses."

            "options": ["Valsalva Maneuver", "Diaphragmatic Breathing with Extended Exhalation", "Apnea Training", "Forced Hyperventilation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing with extended exhalation stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, increasing HRV and promoting vagal tone. Extended exhalations slow the heart rate and enhance the calming effect."

            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "A diet rich in processed foods and sugars", "Probiotic supplementation and a fiber-rich diet", "Complete elimination of all carbohydrates"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Probiotic supplementation and a fiber-rich diet can promote a healthy gut microbiome, which, in turn, can positively influence nervous system function and reduce anxiety symptoms through the Gut-Brain Axis."
