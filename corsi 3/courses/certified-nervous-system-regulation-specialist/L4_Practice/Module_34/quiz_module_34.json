            "question": "A client named Sarah, age 35, becomes visibly triggered during a group exercise involving guided imagery. What is the MOST appropriate immediate response?",
            "options": ["Continue the exercise and encourage her to push through the discomfort", "Publicly address her reaction to demonstrate appropriate emotional expression", "Privately offer her support, grounding techniques, and an option to step away", "Immediately stop the exercise and focus solely on Sarah"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Offering private support, grounding techniques, and the option to step away allows Sarah to regulate her nervous system without feeling pressured or exposed, ensuring her safety and comfort."
