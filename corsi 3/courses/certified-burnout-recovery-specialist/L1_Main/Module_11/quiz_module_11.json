            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element of advanced goal setting for burnout recovery, focusing on intrinsic motivation?",
            "options": ["Setting SMART goals with external rewards.", "Aligning goals with core values and personal meaning.", "Prioritizing tasks based on urgency determined by external deadlines.", "Focusing solely on achieving measurable outcomes, regardless of personal satisfaction."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aligning goals with core values creates intrinsic motivation, which is vital for sustained effort and reduces the risk of burnout. Extrinsic rewards are less effective long-term."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently catastrophizes minor setbacks at work. Which cognitive restructuring technique would be MOST effective in addressing this?",
            "options": ["Thought records to identify and challenge negative thoughts.", "Engaging in more social activities to distract from negative thoughts.", "Avoiding situations that trigger negative thoughts.", "Using affirmations to suppress negative thoughts."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Thought records help Sarah identify, evaluate, and challenge her catastrophic thinking patterns, replacing them with more balanced perspectives. Distraction and avoidance are temporary and suppressive approaches."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-compassion involves treating oneself with kindness, recognizing shared humanity, and practicing mindfulness, which directly counters the self-criticism and isolation often associated with burnout, as supported by Neff's research."

            "options": ["Agreeing to every request to avoid conflict.", "Clearly communicating his limits and saying 'no' assertively, while offering alternative solutions when possible.", "Ignoring requests and hoping they go away.", "Blaming others for his overcommitment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assertive communication is key to boundary setting. John needs to clearly state his limits and offer alternatives when possible to maintain professional relationships while protecting his well-being."

            "explanation": "Effective delegation and energy-based prioritization tackle the root causes of time stress, unlike rigid scheduling or multitasking, which can exacerbate burnout. Working longer hours is counterproductive."

Which aspect of self-compassion was MOST strongly correlated with this reduction?",
            "options": ["Self-pity.", "Self-kindness.", "Self-isolation.", "Self-criticism."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "explanation": "Regular, short mindfulness exercises integrated throughout the day are more effective for sustainable stress reduction than infrequent, prolonged sessions. Mindfulness aims to cultivate awareness, not suppress emotions, and results are gradual."
