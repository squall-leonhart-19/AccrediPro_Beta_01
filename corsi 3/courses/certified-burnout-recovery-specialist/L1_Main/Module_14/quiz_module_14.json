            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which advanced technique focuses on identifying and challenging deeply ingrained, often unconscious, beliefs that contribute to burnout vulnerability, as discussed in L1?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Restructuring", "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction", "Internal Family Systems (IFS)", "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal Family Systems (IFS) directly addresses the various 'parts' within us that may be contributing to burnout, including those driven by unconscious beliefs. Cognitive Restructuring primarily targets conscious thoughts, while MBSR and ACT focus on acceptance and present moment awareness."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "In L2, what is the primary focus of 'lifestyle integration' for burnout prevention?",
            "options": ["Implementing drastic changes to daily routines", "Gradually incorporating sustainable well-being practices into existing routines", "Focusing solely on eliminating stressors", "Ignoring personal preferences to adhere to strict guidelines"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Lifestyle integration emphasizes gradual and sustainable incorporation of well-being practices, making them a natural part of daily life rather than imposing drastic changes. This approach is key to long-term burnout prevention."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently takes on extra work to avoid conflict, leading to burnout. Which advanced boundary-setting strategy from L3 would be MOST effective for her?",
            "options": ["Using assertive communication to decline additional tasks", "Completely isolating herself from work requests", "Agreeing to all requests but performing them poorly", "Ignoring her own needs to fulfill others' expectations"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Assertive communication is the most effective strategy as it allows Sarah to express her needs and limits respectfully while declining additional tasks that contribute to her burnout. Isolation or poor performance are not healthy boundary-setting techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to L4, which of the following is a CORE component of self-compassion, as defined by Kristin Neff?",
            "options": ["Self-pity", "Self-criticism", "Mindfulness", "Ignoring personal suffering"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness is a core component of self-compassion, allowing us to acknowledge our suffering without judgment. Self-pity and self-criticism are the opposite of self-compassion, and ignoring suffering is not a healthy coping mechanism."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "In L5, what is the significance of 'ikigai' in the context of finding purpose and meaning?",
            "options": ["It is a complex mathematical formula for success", "It represents a balance between what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for", "It is a synonym for 'retirement'", "It encourages complete selflessness"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ikigai represents the intersection of passion, profession, vocation, and mission, providing a framework for finding purpose and meaning in life by aligning personal strengths and desires with external needs and rewards."

        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "L6 discusses existential concerns in burnout recovery. Which of the following is an example of an existential question that might contribute to burnout?",
            "options": ["What should I have for lunch?", "What is the meaning of my work?", "How can I improve my typing speed?", "Which brand of coffee is the best?"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Existential questions delve into the deeper meaning and purpose of life, including work. A lack of perceived meaning in one's work can significantly contribute to burnout. The other options are more mundane and do not address existential concerns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A client has shown initial improvement in burnout symptoms but relapses after a stressful period. According to L7, what is the MOST important next step in monitoring and refining their recovery strategy?",
            "options": ["Discontinuing the current strategy and starting a new one", "Analyzing the specific stressors that triggered the relapse and adjusting coping mechanisms accordingly", "Ignoring the relapse and hoping it resolves on its own", "Blaming the client for not adhering to the strategy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Analyzing the relapse to identify specific triggers and adjusting coping mechanisms is crucial for refining the recovery strategy and preventing future relapses. This iterative approach ensures the strategy remains effective and tailored to the client's needs."

        {
            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the ethical guidelines discussed in L8, what is the MOST important consideration when providing long-term burnout support?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Maintaining client confidentiality is paramount in ethical practice, ensuring a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship. Dependence, guaranteed cures, and ignoring conflicts of interest are all unethical practices."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation and boundary setting in managing burnout symptoms. While diet and career changes can be helpful in some cases, the case specifically demonstrated the positive impact of mindfulness and boundaries."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2023 study demonstrated a significant correlation between value-aligned activities and reduced burnout, with individuals experiencing a 55% reduction in burnout symptoms. This highlights the importance of purpose and meaning in burnout recovery."
