            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Avoidance, while providing temporary relief, prevents addressing the root causes of stress and can lead to a worsening of burnout symptoms over time. The module emphasized the importance of active coping strategies."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While all options can contribute to well-being, consistent sleep patterns are fundamental for physiological recovery and have been repeatedly shown to have a direct and significant impact on burnout levels. The module highlighted research indicating that sleep deprivation significantly impairs stress regulation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Perceived control over one's work is a significant factor in burnout risk. Studies show that a lack of autonomy and control over tasks and deadlines significantly contributes to feelings of helplessness and exhaustion. This relates to the Job Demands-Resources model discussed in the module."

            "id": "q2_4",

            "explanation": "The Eisenhower Matrix provides a framework for prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing the client to focus on high-impact activities first and address urgent issues strategically. Starting with prioritization helps to regain control and reduce feelings of overwhelm."
