            "question": "Which of the following is a core dimension assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)?",
            "options": ["Cognitive Impairment", "Emotional Exhaustion", "Physical Aches", "Financial Strain"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional Exhaustion is one of the three core dimensions measured by the MBI, along with Depersonalization and Reduced Personal Accomplishment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client scores high on Depersonalization and Emotional Exhaustion on the MBI, but also reports feeling highly effective at their job. Which MBI dimension might be buffering the overall burnout score?",
            "options": ["Increased Personal Accomplishment", "Cognitive Resilience", "Emotional Regulation", "Job Satisfaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Increased Personal Accomplishment can act as a buffer. Even with high scores on other dimensions, a strong sense of accomplishment can mitigate the overall burnout experience."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) differs from the MBI primarily by focusing on:",
            "options": ["Burnout related to personal life only", "Burnout across personal, work-related, and client-related domains", "Burnout related to physical symptoms only", "Burnout related to cognitive impairment only"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CBI assesses burnout across three domains: personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout, providing a more comprehensive view than the MBI."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which physiological marker has shown promise in burnout research as an indicator of chronic stress and HPA axis dysregulation?",
            "options": ["Elevated White Blood Cell Count", "Decreased Heart Rate Variability (HRV)", "Increased Muscle Mass", "Decreased Blood Glucose"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Decreased Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is often associated with chronic stress and burnout, reflecting reduced adaptability of the autonomic nervous system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A study mentioned in the lesson found that which workplace factor was most strongly correlated with higher burnout scores?",
            "options": ["Lack of Vacation Time", "High Job Demands and Low Job Control", "Poor Office Lighting", "Limited Social Interaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Demand-Control model suggests that high job demands combined with low control over one's work environment are significant predictors of burnout."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "When differentiating burnout from depression, which symptom is more characteristic of burnout than depression?",
            "options": ["Loss of Interest in Activities", "Feelings of Hopelessness", "Cynicism and Detachment from Work", "Sleep Disturbances"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While both conditions share symptoms, cynicism and detachment specifically related to work are more indicative of burnout than depression alone."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "For longitudinal monitoring of burnout recovery, what is the recommended frequency of assessment using a tool like the MBI?",
            "options": ["Once at the end of the intervention", "Every 2-4 weeks during the intervention", "Only when the client reports feeling worse", "Once a year for maintenance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regular assessments every 2-4 weeks allow for tracking progress, identifying setbacks, and adjusting interventions as needed for optimal recovery."

        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which of the following assessment adaptations is MOST appropriate when working with a client from a collectivistic culture?",
            "options": ["Emphasize individual achievement and performance", "Focus solely on objective physiological measures", "Consider the impact of family and community expectations on burnout", "Use only standardized assessment tools without modification"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In collectivistic cultures, family and community expectations can significantly influence an individual's experience of burnout. Assessments should consider these contextual factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A healthcare worker reports emotional exhaustion and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment, but denies any feelings of detachment or cynicism. Based on this presentation, which of the following conditions should be considered in a differential diagnosis?",
            "options": ["Generalized Anxiety Disorder", "Major Depressive Disorder", "Compassion Fatigue", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Compassion fatigue often presents with emotional exhaustion and reduced personal accomplishment due to the empathetic demands of the job, but may lack the detachment seen in burnout."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "In a case study discussed, a teacher experiencing burnout showed significant improvement after an intervention focused on increasing job control and social support. Which assessment tool would be MOST useful in tracking the impact of these specific interventions on the dimensions of burnout?",
            "options": ["The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)", "The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)", "A tailored questionnaire assessing job control and social support", "The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A tailored questionnaire directly assessing job control and social support will provide the most specific and relevant data on the impact of the interventions on those particular factors related to burnout."
