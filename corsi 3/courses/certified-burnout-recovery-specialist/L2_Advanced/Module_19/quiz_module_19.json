            "question": "Which of the following is a core component of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as applied to burnout recovery?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT focuses on the present by helping individuals identify and modify negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to burnout."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A meta-analysis by Schutte et al. (2014) found that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) had what effect on burnout symptoms?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis by Schutte et al. (2014) demonstrated that MBIs can lead to small to moderate improvements in burnout symptoms, particularly emotional exhaustion."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "Which organizational intervention strategy is MOST likely to reduce burnout among employees?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Granting employees autonomy and control over their work can significantly reduce burnout by increasing their sense of ownership and reducing feelings of helplessness."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old social worker, Sarah, reports high levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Which assessment tool would be MOST appropriate for quantifying her burnout levels?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Regular exercise", "Adequate sleep", "Healthy diet", "Chronic sleep deprivation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Chronic sleep deprivation is strongly linked to increased burnout risk. Insufficient sleep impairs cognitive function, emotional regulation, and physical health, exacerbating burnout symptoms. A study published in the 'Journal of Occupational Health Psychology' found that individuals with chronic sleep issues were 2.8 times more likely to experience burnout."

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ahola et al. (2005) identified emotional exhaustion as the burnout dimension most strongly predicted by prolonged exposure to job strain."

            "options": ["Systematic desensitization", "Exposure therapy", "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)", "Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is considered a 'third-wave' CBT approach. It emphasizes acceptance of difficult thoughts and feelings rather than trying to change them directly, and focuses on values-based action."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research on organizational interventions often suffers from methodological limitations, including a scarcity of rigorous randomized controlled trials, a dependence on qualitative data that may lack generalizability, and inadequate sample sizes to detect meaningful effects."
