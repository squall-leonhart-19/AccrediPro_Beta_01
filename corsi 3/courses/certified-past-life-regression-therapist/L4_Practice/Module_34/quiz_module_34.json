            "options": ["Guaranteed deeper trance states for all participants.", "Reduced processing time for emotional breakthroughs.", "Enhanced sense of community and shared experience.", "Elimination of the need for pre-screening participants."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Group settings foster a sense of shared experience and community, which can be therapeutic. Individual attention is reduced, affecting trance depth and processing time."

            "question": "According to the module, what is a crucial element in designing an effective group past life regression program?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to a pre-scripted regression narrative.", "Flexibility to adapt to the group's energy and needs.", "Focusing solely on resolving past trauma in all participants.", "Avoiding any discussion of ethical considerations to prevent anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flexibility allows the facilitator to adjust the program based on the group's dynamics and individual needs, as rigid scripts can hinder the process."

            "question": "In advanced group regression techniques, what is the purpose of 'anchoring'?",
            "options": ["To physically restrain participants during emotional releases.", "To create a safe and familiar space for participants to return to during the regression.", "To force participants to confront past life traumas directly.", "To speed up the regression process by bypassing initial relaxation techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchoring provides a secure point of reference, helping participants feel safe and grounded during and after intense emotional experiences in the regression."

            "explanation": "Effective marketing aims to attract the right participants who are prepared for the experience, rather than solely focusing on quantity."

            "question": "What is the best approach to managing a participant who becomes highly emotional or disruptive during a group regression?",
            "options": ["Publicly confronting the participant to regain control of the group.", "Ignoring the participant's behavior to avoid disrupting the regression for others.", "Privately offering support and potentially removing the participant from the group if necessary.", "Encouraging other participants to help the disruptive individual."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing private support ensures the individual's needs are addressed without disrupting the group, and removal might be necessary for the safety of all participants."

            "explanation": "The 'Healing Hearts' case study highlighted the importance of a supportive environment in facilitating positive outcomes for participants dealing with relationship issues."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pre-screening is crucial to assess suitability and ensure the individual's safety and well-being, as group regression may not be appropriate for everyone with anxiety disorders."
