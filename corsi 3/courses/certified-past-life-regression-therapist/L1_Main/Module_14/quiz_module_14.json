            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective way to establish a robust anchor for regression work, according to Dr. Karen E Wells' research?",
            "options": ["Using a general feeling of relaxation.", "Associating a specific, vivid sensory experience with a desired state.", "Repeating a mantra silently.", "Focusing on the breath."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dr. Wells' research emphasizes the power of specific, vivid sensory experiences for creating strong anchors. A general feeling is too vague, and mantras/breathwork are less direct."

            "id": "q14_2",

            "question": "A client begins to experience intense emotional flooding during a regression session. Which stabilization technique should be prioritized FIRST?",
            "options": ["Immediately ending the session.", "Guiding the client to a safe space anchor and practicing grounding techniques.", "Encouraging the client to fully express their emotions without intervention.", "Administering a mild sedative (if qualified)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The immediate priority is to ensure the client's safety and stability. A safe space anchor and grounding techniques provide a sense of control and reduce the intensity of the emotional flooding."

            "options": ["Reassuring her that past lives are definitely real.", "Exploring the source of her doubt and reframing the experience as a metaphorical journey.", "Ignoring her doubts and continuing the regression process.", "Challenging her beliefs with evidence from other clients' experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
