            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST crucial element when establishing an anchor in advanced regression therapy?",
            "options": ["The client's physical comfort during the process.", "The therapist's unwavering belief in the process.", "Intense emotional state and clear association to the target memory.", "The use of specific colors or sounds during the anchoring."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The strength of an anchor directly correlates with the intensity of the emotional state and the clarity of its association with the target memory. Physical comfort and therapist belief are important but secondary."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "In somatic experiencing, 'titration' refers to:",
            "options": ["Gradually increasing the intensity of the regression.", "Slowly introducing past life concepts to the client.", "Incrementally accessing and processing traumatic material.", "Measuring the client's suggestibility level."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Titration, as defined in somatic experiencing, involves incrementally accessing and processing traumatic material to avoid overwhelming the client's nervous system."

            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "According to ethical guidelines, which of the following actions would be MOST appropriate if a client develops strong transference towards you during a past life regression session?",
            "options": ["Explore the transference within the context of the past life narrative.", "Gently acknowledge the transference and redirect the focus back to the therapeutic goals.", "Immediately terminate the session and refer the client to another therapist.", "Encourage the client to fully express their feelings to facilitate catharsis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the transference and redirecting focus to therapeutic goals maintains ethical boundaries and ensures the client's well-being. Exploring it directly within the session can blur boundaries and encourage full expression could be harmful."

            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of deepening hypnotic induction techniques in the context of past life regression?",
            "options": ["To increase the therapist's control over the client's subconscious.", "To enhance the client's ability to access and process past life memories.", "To shorten the overall duration of the regression session.", "To make the client more compliant and suggestible."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deepening hypnotic induction aims to facilitate access to past life memories and enhance processing by creating a more receptive and relaxed state."

            "options": ["Always accept the guidance provided without question.", "Encourage the client to critically evaluate the information received.", "Directly channel the spirit guide for the client.", "Interpret the spirit guide's messages for the client based on your own intuition."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clients should critically evaluate information received to maintain autonomy and avoid undue influence. The therapist's role is to facilitate the process, not to interpret or channel."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Anchoring a feeling of safety and confidence (a positive state) to a physical touch allows Sarah to consciously access that feeling in anxiety-provoking social situations, counteracting the negative association."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
