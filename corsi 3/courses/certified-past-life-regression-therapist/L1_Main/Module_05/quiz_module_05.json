            "question": "In the context of past life regression, empowerment primarily refers to:",
            "options": ["Reliving past traumas without processing them.", "Gaining control and agency over one's life by understanding and integrating past experiences.", "Blaming past lives for current challenges.", "Becoming dependent on the therapist for guidance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Empowerment in PLR focuses on clients taking control and agency by integrating past experiences into their present lives. It's about fostering independence, not dependence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q5_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a recommended strategy for facilitating integration after a past life regression?",
            "options": ["Journaling about the experience.", "Creating art inspired by the regression.", "Immediately making major life decisions based solely on the regression.", "Discussing the experience with a trusted friend or therapist."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Major life decisions should not be made immediately after a regression without careful consideration and integration. Rushing into changes can be destabilizing."

            "id": "q5_3",
            "question": "A client consistently expresses doubt about the validity of their past life regression experience. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Dismiss their doubts and insist on the reality of past lives.", "Explore the symbolic meaning and emotional impact of the experience, regardless of its literal truth.", "Immediately terminate the session.", "Encourage them to undergo multiple regressions to 'prove' the experience."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focusing on the symbolic and emotional content allows the client to benefit from the experience even if they doubt its literal truth. This approach validates their feelings and promotes integration."

            "question": "According to the lesson on forgiveness, what is the primary focus of forgiveness work in past life regression?",
            "options": ["Exonerating those who caused harm in the past life.", "Releasing oneself from the emotional burden of past grievances, regardless of whether the other party is deserving.", "Seeking revenge on those who wronged you in a past life.", "Forgetting the past entirely."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The goal of forgiveness is to release oneself from the emotional baggage of the past, regardless of the actions of others. It's about personal healing, not necessarily excusing harmful behavior."

            "id": "q5_5",
            "question": "In a case study, a 45-year-old client, 'Sarah,' experienced a past life as a soldier. She now struggles with chronic anxiety. To facilitate integration, what personalized action plan element would be MOST beneficial?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the past life experience and focusing solely on present-day anxiety management.", "Engaging in activities that promote peace and relaxation, such as meditation or yoga, to counteract the soldier's hypervigilance.", "Joining a military reenactment group to relive the past life.", "Becoming a pacifist and protesting all forms of conflict."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Activities promoting peace and relaxation directly address the anxiety stemming from the past life experience, facilitating integration by creating a sense of balance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Affirmations should be positive and empowering. 'I am strong, capable, and in control of my life' directly counters the feeling of powerlessness."

        {
            "id": "q5_7",
            "question": "What is a common manifestation of resistance to empowerment during the integration process?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance often manifests as blaming external factors and avoiding personal responsibility. This prevents the client from taking ownership of their healing process."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises help clients stay present and manage overwhelming emotions safely. Suppression is generally not a healthy coping mechanism."
