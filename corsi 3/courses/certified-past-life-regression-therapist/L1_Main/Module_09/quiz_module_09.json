            "id": "q9_2",
            "question": "During the 'Retrieval of Memories' (R) stage, which advanced induction technique is MOST likely to help a client access a deeply repressed past life memory, particularly if standard techniques have been ineffective?",
            "options": ["Progressive relaxation.", "Age regression to early childhood.", "The Affect Bridge Technique.", "Guided visualization of a peaceful garden."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Affect Bridge Technique, which focuses on linking a present-day emotion to a past event, is often effective in accessing deeply repressed memories that other induction techniques may miss. This technique leverages the power of emotional resonance to unlock blocked experiences."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Acceptance and Acknowledgement' stage is crucial for validating the client's experience, regardless of its perceived reality. It focuses on integrating the insights gained from the regression, fostering self-compassion and understanding."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forgiveness techniques, such as Ho'oponopono, are highly effective in the 'Cleansing and Clearing' stage for releasing guilt and shame associated with past life actions. These techniques help the client to forgive themselves and others, promoting emotional healing."

            "question": "During the 'Empowerment and Integration' (E) stage, a client realizes they had a past life as a successful artist. How can this insight BEST be applied to their current life, according to the T.R.A.C.E. Framework™?",
