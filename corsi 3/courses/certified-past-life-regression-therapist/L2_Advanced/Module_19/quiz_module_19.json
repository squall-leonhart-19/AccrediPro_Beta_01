            "question": "Which of the following is a primary characteristic of qualitative research in past life regression?",
            "options": ["Statistical analysis of large datasets", "In-depth exploration of individual experiences", "Emphasis on quantifiable outcomes", "Randomized controlled trials"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Qualitative research focuses on understanding the depth and nuances of individual experiences rather than quantifying them."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A researcher aims to measure the change in anxiety levels after a past life regression session using a standardized anxiety scale. This is an example of:",
            "options": ["Qualitative research", "Quantitative research", "Mixed-methods research", "Case study research"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using a standardized scale to measure anxiety levels involves numerical data, which is characteristic of quantitative research."

            "question": "Meta-analyses of past life regression studies primarily aim to:",
            "options": ["Provide detailed narratives of individual experiences", "Combine the results of multiple studies to increase statistical power", "Explore the philosophical implications of reincarnation", "Develop new therapeutic techniques"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Meta-analyses synthesize the findings of multiple studies to provide a more robust and reliable estimate of the effect of past life regression."

        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "According to neuroscientific perspectives, what brain activity is MOST likely associated with past life regression experiences?",
            "options": ["Increased activity in the prefrontal cortex", "Decreased activity in the amygdala", "Activity patterns similar to those observed during guided meditation and memory recall", "Suppression of all cortical activity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Neuroscientific studies suggest that brain activity during past life regression often resembles patterns seen in guided meditation and memory recall, involving various brain regions associated with imagery and emotion."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "How can a researcher best account for the influence of belief systems in a study on past life regression?",
            "options": ["Ignoring participants' beliefs to maintain objectivity", "Using only participants who have strong beliefs in reincarnation", "Assessing and documenting participants' beliefs and worldviews", "Assuming all participants have the same beliefs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and documenting participants' beliefs and worldviews is crucial for understanding how these factors might influence their experiences and the research findings."

            "options": ["Quantitative data collection", "Neuroimaging study", "Phenomenological research", "Randomized controlled trial"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenomenological research focuses on understanding the lived experiences and perceptions of individuals, which aligns with the researcher's goal in this scenario."

            "question": "What is a key ethical consideration when conducting research on past life regression?",
            "options": ["Ensuring participants believe in reincarnation", "Avoiding any discussion of skepticism", "Protecting participants from potential psychological distress or false memories", "Guaranteeing the accuracy of past life memories"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical research prioritizes the well-being of participants, including minimizing potential psychological harm and addressing the possibility of false memories."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A study reports a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in PTSD symptoms following past life regression therapy. What does this indicate?",
            "options": ["The reduction in symptoms is definitely due to past life regression.", "There is a less than 5% chance that the observed reduction in symptoms occurred by random chance.", "Past life regression is proven to be effective for treating PTSD.", "The sample size was too small to draw meaningful conclusions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance, meaning there is a low probability that the results are due to chance."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Which of the following research designs is BEST suited for establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between past life regression therapy and symptom reduction?",
            "options": ["Case study", "Correlational study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Qualitative interview study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for establishing cause-and-effect relationships because they involve random assignment to treatment and control groups, minimizing bias."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A systematic review of 15 studies on past life regression and anxiety found an average effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.45 with a 95% confidence interval of [0.20, 0.70]. What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["Past life regression has a negligible effect on anxiety.", "The true effect size is likely outside the range of 0.20 to 0.70.", "Past life regression has a small to medium effect on anxiety, and we can be 95% confident that the true effect size lies within the specified interval.", "The results are statistically insignificant."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An effect size of 0.45 is generally considered a small to medium effect, and the confidence interval indicates the range within which the true effect size is likely to fall."
