            "question": "A client presents with acute anxiety following a recent car accident. Which aspect of the ALIGN framework should be prioritized initially?",
            "options": ["Assessing structural imbalances", "Listening deeply to their narrative", "Initiating gentle cranial holds", "Guiding them through a body scan to anchor them in the present"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In acute trauma, prioritizing 'Listening' establishes safety and rapport, crucial before addressing structural or energetic imbalances. A study showed that clients who feel heard and validated experience less distress during trauma processing."

        {
            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial response when a client begins to dissociate during a CST session?",
            "options": ["Increase the intensity of cranial holds to ground them", "Immediately stop the session and refer them to a mental health professional", "Gently encourage them to notice their feet on the ground and their breath", "Ask them detailed questions about their traumatic experience"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques, such as focusing on the breath or physical sensations, are the most appropriate initial response to dissociation. This helps the client return to the present moment without overwhelming their system."

            "id": "q28_3",
            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia reports increased pain and fatigue after their first CST session. What is the MOST likely explanation?",
            "options": ["The CST was ineffective and should be discontinued", "The client is experiencing a normal healing response, and symptoms should improve within 24-48 hours", "The CST was too aggressive and triggered a flare-up of their condition", "The client is resistant to the therapy and subconsciously exaggerating their symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Clients with chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia can be highly sensitive. An overly aggressive approach can trigger a flare-up. Gentle, subtle techniques are crucial. Start with very light touch and minimal pressure."

        {
            "id": "q28_4",
            "question": "When working with a client undergoing cancer treatment, which of the following is MOST important to consider?",
            "options": ["Applying deep tissue techniques to stimulate lymphatic drainage", "Coordinating care with their oncologist and other healthcare providers", "Encouraging them to discontinue conventional medical treatments", "Focusing solely on the physical symptoms and ignoring emotional distress"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Collaboration with the client's medical team is paramount when working with cancer patients. CST should complement, not replace, conventional medical treatments. This ensures safe and effective care."

            "id": "q28_5",
            "question": "A client with multiple sclerosis (MS) presents with spasticity and limited range of motion. Which CST technique would be MOST appropriate to address these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Directly mobilizing restricted joints with forceful movements", "Gentle unwinding and balancing of fascial restrictions", "Applying sustained pressure to trigger points", "Instructing the client to perform aggressive stretching exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle unwinding and balancing of fascial restrictions is the most appropriate approach for clients with MS. Forceful techniques can exacerbate spasticity and cause further injury. Subtlety is key."

        {
            "id": "q28_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a dual relationship that should be avoided in CST practice?",
            "options": ["Treating a family member or close friend", "Referring a client to another healthcare professional", "Accepting payment for services rendered", "Maintaining professional boundaries with clients"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Treating a family member or close friend creates a dual relationship, which can compromise objectivity and professional boundaries. This is unethical and potentially harmful to the client."

            "id": "q28_7",
            "question": "A client with a history of complex trauma suddenly becomes agitated and starts crying during a CST session. They report feeling overwhelmed and unsafe. What is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue with the session, reassuring them that they are safe", "Immediately stop the session and help them ground themselves", "Encourage them to process their emotions by asking detailed questions about their trauma", "Minimize their feelings and redirect their attention to their physical sensations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "When a client becomes overwhelmed during a session, the best course of action is to immediately stop, acknowledge their feelings, and help them ground themselves. Continuing could re-traumatize them."

            "id": "q28_8",
            "question": "In cases of chronic pain, CST aims to modulate the central nervous system by:",
            "options": ["Directly targeting the source of pain", "Releasing peripheral nerve entrapments", "Influencing the dural tube and cerebrospinal fluid flow", "Increasing muscle strength and flexibility"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CST's primary focus in chronic pain management is to influence the dural tube and cerebrospinal fluid flow, thereby modulating the central nervous system's pain processing mechanisms. This approach addresses the root causes of chronic pain."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, reports significant joint pain and stiffness. After several CST sessions, Sarah reports a 30% reduction in pain and improved range of motion. This outcome demonstrates the potential of CST to:",
            "options": ["Cure autoimmune disorders", "Replace conventional medical treatments for arthritis", "Manage symptoms and improve quality of life in autoimmune conditions", "Reverse structural damage caused by rheumatoid arthritis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While CST cannot cure autoimmune disorders or reverse structural damage, it can effectively manage symptoms and improve the quality of life for individuals with these conditions. The 30% reduction in pain and improved range of motion in Sarah's case is evidence of this."

            "question": "When developing a treatment plan for a client with a complex neurological condition, which of the following should be prioritized?",
            "options": ["Following a rigid, standardized protocol", "Focusing solely on the client's primary diagnosis", "Adopting a flexible and individualized approach based on the client's unique presentation", "Ignoring the client's subjective experience and relying solely on objective assessments"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A flexible and individualized approach is essential when working with complex neurological conditions. Each client presents uniquely, and treatment plans should be tailored to their specific needs and responses. Standardized protocols are often insufficient."
