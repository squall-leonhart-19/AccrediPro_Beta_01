            "question": "In craniosacral therapy for neurological conditions, which of the following is the MOST likely primary focus?",
            "options": ["Directly manipulating the affected nerves", "Releasing restrictions in the dura mater and optimizing CSF flow", "Prescribing pharmaceutical interventions", "Performing deep tissue massage on the peripheral muscles"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Craniosacral therapy primarily aims to optimize the environment of the central nervous system by releasing restrictions in the dura mater and promoting healthy CSF flow, indirectly supporting neurological function."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 6-year-old child presents with persistent headaches and difficulty concentrating in school. The mother reports a difficult birth involving forceps. Which craniosacral therapy technique would be MOST appropriate to initially address potential birth trauma?",
            "options": ["Directly addressing the sphenobasilar junction", "Gentle mobilization of the occiput and sacrum", "Deep tissue release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle", "Administering a high-velocity, low-amplitude adjustment to the cervical spine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle mobilization of the occiput and sacrum is a safe and effective initial approach to address potential birth trauma, aiming to release restrictions and restore balance within the craniosacral system. This aligns with the gentle, non-invasive nature of CST, particularly important in pediatric cases."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on trauma resolution, what is the primary goal of craniosacral therapy in helping clients process traumatic experiences?",
            "options": ["To directly confront and analyze the traumatic event", "To create a safe space for the client's nervous system to self-regulate and release held tension", "To provide cognitive reframing of the traumatic memory", "To suppress the emotional response associated with the trauma"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Craniosacral therapy aims to create a safe and supportive environment for the client's nervous system to self-regulate and release held tension related to trauma, rather than directly confronting or analyzing the traumatic event. This approach supports the body's natural healing processes."

            "question": "In the context of TMJ disorders, which of the following cranial bones is MOST directly related to the movement and function of the mandible?",
            "options": ["Frontal bone", "Temporal bone", "Parietal bone", "Ethmoid bone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The temporal bone forms the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), making it directly involved in the movement and function of the mandible. Restrictions in the temporal bone can significantly impact TMJ function and contribute to TMJ disorders."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A client with fibromyalgia presents with widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. Which of the following craniosacral techniques would be MOST appropriate to address the central sensitization often associated with this condition?",
            "options": ["Deep tissue massage of the affected muscles", "Gentle release of the dural tube and cranial base", "High-intensity interval training", "Trigger point injections"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle release of the dural tube and cranial base can help to reduce central sensitization by promoting optimal CSF flow and reducing stress on the central nervous system. This aligns with the understanding that fibromyalgia involves heightened pain processing in the brain and spinal cord."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "An athlete reports decreased performance and persistent muscle tightness despite adequate training and recovery. When using craniosacral therapy for sports performance enhancement, what is a key objective?",
            "options": ["To increase muscle mass", "To optimize the function of the nervous system and improve biomechanical efficiency", "To suppress pain signals during competition", "To administer performance-enhancing drugs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Craniosacral therapy aims to optimize the function of the nervous system and improve biomechanical efficiency in athletes, leading to enhanced coordination, balance, and overall performance. It focuses on addressing underlying restrictions that may be limiting the athlete's potential."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "How does craniosacral therapy potentially influence the immune system?",
            "options": ["By directly stimulating the production of antibodies", "By optimizing the environment for immune cell function through improved CSF flow and reduced nervous system stress", "By suppressing inflammatory responses", "By directly killing pathogens"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Craniosacral therapy's influence on the immune system is primarily through optimizing the environment for immune cell function by improving CSF flow and reducing nervous system stress. This allows for better communication and regulation within the immune system."

            "question": "In advanced palpation, what is the term for the subtle, rhythmic motion that is perceived as an expression of the body's inherent vitality?",
            "options": ["Muscle tone", "Primary respiratory mechanism (PRM)", "Joint play", "Skin turgor"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Primary Respiratory Mechanism (PRM) refers to the subtle, rhythmic motion that is perceived as an expression of the body's inherent vitality in craniosacral therapy. It's a key aspect of advanced palpation skills."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of chronic anxiety reports experiencing intense emotional releases during a CST session. What is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and refer the client to a psychiatrist", "Continue with the session, encouraging the client to fully express their emotions", "Provide a safe and supportive space for the client to process their emotions, while monitoring their comfort level and adjusting the session as needed", "Attempt to suppress the emotional release by using distraction techniques"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Providing a safe and supportive space for the client to process their emotions, while monitoring their comfort level and adjusting the session as needed, is the most appropriate course of action. This approach acknowledges the potential for emotional releases during CST while prioritizing the client's safety and well-being."
