            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "When palpating the sphenoid bone, which movement pattern indicates a potential torsion strain?",
            "options": ["Bilateral flexion and extension occur symmetrically.", "One side of the sphenoid appears to move into flexion while the other moves into extension.", "The sphenoid remains fixed with no discernible movement.", "The sphenoid exhibits exaggerated lateral flexion."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A torsion strain pattern is characterized by asymmetrical movement, where one side of the sphenoid flexes while the other extends. This often indicates a rotational stress through the cranial base."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client presents with TMJ pain and limited jaw movement. Which temporal bone dysfunction is MOST likely contributing to their symptoms?",
            "options": ["External rotation of the temporal bone.", "Internal rotation of the temporal bone.", "Superior shear of the temporal bone.", "Compression of the jugular foramen."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Internal rotation of the temporal bone can directly impinge on the TMJ, limiting movement and causing pain. External rotation may contribute, but internal rotation is more directly linked to compression of the joint."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone forms a major part of which structure?",
            "options": ["The cribriform plate.", "The nasal septum.", "The crista galli.", "The superior orbital fissure."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The perpendicular plate extends inferiorly from the ethmoid bone to form the superior portion of the nasal septum, dividing the nasal cavity."

        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "Which of the following techniques BEST addresses restrictions within the falx cerebri?",
            "options": ["Sacral base release.", "Direct mobilization of the occiput.", "Gentle traction and balanced tension techniques along the sagittal suture.", "Parietal lift."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The falx cerebri attaches along the sagittal suture. Gentle traction and balanced tension techniques directly address restrictions within this dural membrane."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "Which cranial nerve is MOST directly assessed by evaluating the gag reflex?",
            "options": ["Facial nerve (CN VII).", "Vagus nerve (CN X).", "Trigeminal nerve (CN V).", "Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve (CN X) plays a crucial role in the gag reflex, along with the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Assessing the gag reflex helps evaluate the function of CN X."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "When integrating visceral manipulation with craniosacral therapy, addressing which organ is MOST likely to influence the mobility of the right temporal bone, according to the lessons?",
            "options": ["The liver.", "The stomach.", "The spleen.", "The kidneys."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The liver's fascial connections to the diaphragm and rib cage can indirectly influence temporal bone mobility, particularly on the right side. Restrictions in the liver can create tension patterns that affect cranial structures."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "In trauma-informed craniosacral therapy, what is the PRIMARY focus when working with a client who has a history of sexual abuse?",
            "options": ["To directly address the trauma memory held in the body.", "To establish a safe and predictable therapeutic environment, prioritizing client autonomy.", "To encourage the client to verbalize their traumatic experiences.", "To aggressively release fascial restrictions related to the trauma."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Safety, predictability, and client autonomy are paramount in trauma-informed care. Establishing a safe environment where the client feels in control is crucial for healing and preventing re-traumatization."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic migraines and a history of whiplash. During your assessment, you identify a significant restriction in the SBS. What is the MOST appropriate initial treatment strategy?",
            "options": ["Immediately address the SBS restriction with a direct technique.", "Begin with gentle indirect techniques to release tension in the cervical spine and dura before addressing the SBS.", "Focus solely on the cranial nerves involved in headache pain.", "Refer the client for immediate chiropractic adjustment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the history of whiplash, it's essential to gently release tension in the cervical spine and dura before directly addressing the SBS. This approach minimizes the risk of exacerbating symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "According to the case study presented in L8 involving a client with chronic fatigue, which cranial bone dysfunction was MOST commonly observed?",
            "options": ["Sphenoid base compression.", "Temporal bone external rotation.", "Frontal bone restriction.", "Occipital condylar compression."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted that sphenoid base compression was frequently observed in clients presenting with chronic fatigue, potentially impacting pituitary function and overall energy regulation."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "You are treating a client with trigeminal neuralgia. Palpation reveals a significant restriction around the foramen ovale. Which technique is MOST appropriate to address this restriction?",
            "options": ["Direct pressure over the trigeminal nerve.", "Gentle traction and mobilization of the sphenoid bone, focusing on the greater wing.", "Rapid, oscillatory movements of the mandible.", "Deep tissue massage of the masseter muscle."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The foramen ovale, through which the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve passes, is located in the greater wing of the sphenoid. Gentle mobilization of the sphenoid can help release restrictions around the foramen and alleviate nerve compression."
