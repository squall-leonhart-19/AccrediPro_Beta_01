            "question": "Which of the following is a primary goal of craniosacral assessment?",
            "options": ["To diagnose specific medical conditions.", "To identify areas of restriction and asymmetry within the craniosacral system.", "To prescribe pharmaceutical interventions.", "To replace conventional medical treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Craniosacral assessment focuses on identifying restrictions and asymmetries to inform treatment, not on medical diagnosis or replacing conventional care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons, what anatomical structure plays a crucial role in connecting the cranium and the sacrum?",
            "options": ["The vertebral arteries.", "The dura mater.", "The cerebrospinal fluid.", "The temporomandibular joint."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dura mater, a tough membrane, encases the brain and spinal cord, connecting the cranium and sacrum and influencing the craniosacral system."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "During visual observation, a client presents with one shoulder noticeably higher than the other. Which of the following is the MOST likely initial consideration?",
            "options": ["The client has scoliosis.", "The client is intentionally posturing in that way.", "There may be muscular imbalances or postural adaptations affecting the craniosacral system.", "The client has a fracture."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Postural imbalances often reflect underlying restrictions or compensations within the musculoskeletal and craniosacral systems. Further investigation is needed before assuming scoliosis or a fracture."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "What is the primary focus of the global assessment in craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Detailed analysis of individual cranial bones.", "Evaluation of the client's overall posture and body mechanics.", "Measurement of cerebrospinal fluid pressure.", "Precise diagnosis of neurological disorders."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The global assessment aims to understand the client's overall structural alignment and movement patterns, providing context for more specific assessments."

        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "When assessing the cranial base, which bone is considered a central keystone due to its articulation with all other cranial bones?",
            "options": ["The frontal bone.", "The temporal bone.", "The sphenoid bone.", "The occipital bone."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sphenoid bone articulates with all other cranial bones, making it a crucial structure to assess for its impact on overall cranial function."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "While palpating the sacrum, you notice a distinct asymmetry in movement. Which of the following structures is MOST likely involved?",
            "options": ["The foramen magnum.", "The sagittal suture.", "The sacroiliac joint.", "The coronal suture."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The sacroiliac joint (SI joint) connects the sacrum to the ilium and is a common site of restriction and asymmetry, impacting sacral movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of the dural tube assessment?",
            "options": ["To measure the flow rate of cerebrospinal fluid.", "To evaluate the tension and mobility of the dura mater surrounding the spinal cord.", "To diagnose herniated discs.", "To assess the function of the cranial nerves."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dural tube assessment focuses on identifying areas of tension or restriction within the dura mater, which can impact the craniosacral system."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old client, 'Jane', presents with chronic headaches and reports a history of a tailbone injury 10 years ago. During assessment, you find significant tension in the dural tube and restricted movement in the sacrum. How should you integrate these findings?",
            "options": ["Ignore the tailbone injury as it is too old to be relevant.", "Focus solely on the cranial restrictions and treat those first.", "Consider the tailbone injury as a potential contributing factor to the dural tension and headaches, and address the sacral restrictions in conjunction with cranial work.", "Refer Jane immediately for neurological testing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrating assessment findings involves recognizing potential connections between seemingly disparate issues. The tailbone injury could be contributing to dural tension and headaches, necessitating a holistic approach."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the lessons, what percentage of individuals with chronic lower back pain also exhibit restrictions in the craniosacral system?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%.", "Approximately 30%.", "Approximately 60%.", "Approximately 90%."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies suggest that around 60% of individuals with chronic lower back pain also demonstrate craniosacral restrictions, highlighting the interconnectedness of these systems."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "After completing a comprehensive craniosacral assessment, you identify several areas of restriction. What is the MOST important next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin aggressive treatment to release all restrictions.", "Prioritize the restrictions based on their impact on the overall system and the client's primary complaint.", "Refer the client to a chiropractor.", "Recommend surgery."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing treatment based on the interconnectedness of the system and the client's symptoms is crucial for effective and gentle craniosacral therapy. Addressing the most impactful restrictions first allows the system to self-correct more effectively."
