            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "In advanced fulcrum techniques, what is the MOST important factor to consider when applying a fulcrum?",
            "options": ["The amount of pressure applied", "The practitioner's body mechanics", "The client's emotional state", "The precise location and direction of force"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all options are relevant, the precise location and direction of force are paramount in achieving the desired therapeutic effect with advanced fulcrum techniques. Subtle adjustments can dramatically alter the outcome."

        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "When addressing complex dural restrictions, which of the following is the MOST likely indicator of a significant restriction pattern?",
            "options": ["A localized area of tenderness", "Asymmetrical cranial bone movement", "A global sense of tension reported by the client", "Palpable heat in the sacral region"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Asymmetrical cranial bone movement strongly suggests a dural restriction pattern, as the dura mater directly influences cranial bone mobility. While other options may indicate general tension, asymmetry is more specific."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to research presented in the module, what is the approximate percentage increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow observed with specific craniosacral techniques?",
            "options": ["5-10%", "15-20%", "25-30%", "35-40%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies have indicated that specific craniosacral techniques can enhance CSF flow by approximately 25-30%, potentially improving nutrient delivery and waste removal within the central nervous system."

        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "Which of the following diaphragms is MOST directly associated with the regulation of sympathetic nervous system activity?",
            "options": ["Pelvic diaphragm", "Thoracic diaphragm", "Tentorium cerebelli", "Hyoid diaphragm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The thoracic diaphragm's connection to the vagus nerve and its influence on respiration make it a key player in modulating sympathetic nervous system activity. Its rhythmic movement directly impacts vagal tone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic anxiety and hyperventilation. Which craniosacral technique would be MOST appropriate to begin with?",
            "options": ["Frontal lift", "Sacral rocking", "Vagal nerve stimulation", "Sphenobasilar decompression"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the client's anxiety and hyperventilation, vagal nerve stimulation is the most appropriate starting point. The vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and regulating breathing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In advanced TMJ dysfunction treatment, what is the significance of addressing the sphenoid bone?",
            "options": ["It directly articulates with the mandible", "It influences the dural attachment to the TMJ", "It controls the muscles of mastication", "It is the primary site of emotional holding"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The sphenoid bone's position within the cranium and its dural attachments make it a key component in TMJ dysfunction. Restrictions in the sphenoid can directly impact the TMJ's alignment and function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "During Somato-Emotional Release (SER), a client experiences a sudden surge of anger and begins to tremble. What is the MOST appropriate initial response from the practitioner?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop the session", "Encourage the client to suppress the emotion", "Provide a safe and supportive space for the client to express the emotion", "Distract the client with conversation"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Providing a safe and supportive space is crucial during SER. Allowing the client to express the emotion without judgment or interruption can facilitate the release process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic headaches, TMJ pain, and digestive issues. Which cranial nerve is MOST likely involved in this symptom cluster?",
            "options": ["Trigeminal nerve (CN V)", "Facial nerve (CN VII)", "Vagus nerve (CN X)", "Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the digestive system, TMJ, and has connections to the head, making it a likely contributor to the client's symptoms. Dysfunction in this nerve can manifest in various seemingly unrelated issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "In advanced treatment planning, what is a key difference between a symptomatic approach and a structural approach?",
            "options": ["A symptomatic approach addresses the root cause of the problem, while a structural approach focuses on immediate relief.", "A symptomatic approach focuses on immediate relief, while a structural approach addresses the root cause of the problem.", "A symptomatic approach is always the preferred method.", "There is no real difference between the two approaches."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A symptomatic approach aims to alleviate the client's immediate complaints, while a structural approach seeks to identify and address the underlying biomechanical imbalances contributing to those symptoms. Structural changes often lead to longer-lasting relief."

            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "A 55-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic lower back pain and a history of emotional trauma. After several sessions, you notice a subtle, rhythmic movement in her sacrum during SER. What is the MOST likely interpretation of this movement?",
            "options": ["A sign of dural restriction", "An indication of sacral misalignment", "A release of stored emotional energy", "A normal physiological response"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "During SER, subtle movements, such as rhythmic sacral motion, can indicate a release of stored emotional energy within the tissues. The body's innate healing mechanisms are often expressed through these subtle shifts."
