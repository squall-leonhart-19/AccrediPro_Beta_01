            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is MOST crucial for developing refined palpatory skills in craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Applying deep pressure to identify bony landmarks.", "Maintaining a neutral and non-judgmental state of mind.", "Relying solely on anatomical knowledge to guide touch.", "Focusing on correcting perceived imbalances immediately."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a neutral and non-judgmental state allows for a more accurate perception of subtle cues from the client's body, as discussed in L1 and L2."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic headaches and reports a history of whiplash. During your assessment, you notice a restriction in the client's dura. Which cranial nerve is MOST likely affected and contributing to the client's symptoms?",
            "options": ["Optic Nerve (CN II)", "Vagus Nerve (CN X)", "Trigeminal Nerve (CN V)", "Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Trigeminal Nerve (CN V) is responsible for sensation in the face and motor function of the muscles of mastication. Dural restrictions can impinge on this nerve, leading to headaches and facial pain, as detailed in L5."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "While palpating the craniosacral rhythm, you notice the rate is significantly faster than the average 6-12 cycles per minute. Which of the following factors could potentially contribute to this increased rate?",
            "options": ["Deep relaxation and parasympathetic activation.", "Dehydration and decreased cerebrospinal fluid production.", "Elevated stress levels and sympathetic nervous system dominance.", "Optimal craniosacral system function."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated stress and sympathetic nervous system activation can increase the craniosacral rhythm rate, as covered in L3. Conversely, parasympathetic activation tends to slow it down."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "In the case study presented in L8, a 45-year-old client with chronic lower back pain experienced significant relief after addressing restrictions in which primary diaphragm?",
            "options": ["Pelvic Diaphragm", "Thoracic Diaphragm", "Cranial Diaphragm (Tentorium Cerebelli)", "Hyoid Diaphragm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study in L8 highlighted the importance of the Thoracic Diaphragm in lower back pain, demonstrating how its restrictions can impact the entire craniosacral system. Releasing the thoracic diaphragm allowed for improved mobility and pain reduction."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the concept of 'Energetic Boundaries' in the context of craniosacral therapy practice?",
            "options": ["Applying firm pressure to ensure effective treatment.", "Maintaining a clear distinction between the practitioner's and the client's energy fields.", "Sharing personal experiences with the client to build rapport.", "Encouraging the client to fully merge their energy with the practitioner's."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Energetic boundaries involve maintaining a clear distinction between the practitioner's and client's energy fields to prevent transference and ensure the practitioner's well-being, as discussed in L4."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "During fascial listening, you identify a significant restriction along the thoracolumbar fascia. This restriction MOST likely impacts which of the following structures?",
            "options": ["The temporomandibular joint (TMJ).", "The cranial base.", "The pelvic girdle and lower extremities.", "The cervical spine and upper extremities."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The thoracolumbar fascia connects the upper and lower body, playing a vital role in transmitting forces and maintaining postural stability. Restrictions in this area directly impact the pelvic girdle and lower extremities, as explained in L6."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following statements accurately reflects the relationship between the dural tube and the craniosacral system?",
            "options": ["The dural tube is entirely separate from the craniosacral system.", "The dural tube directly connects the cranium to the sacrum, influencing the movement of cerebrospinal fluid.", "The dural tube primarily affects the peripheral nervous system.", "The dural tube is only relevant in cases of traumatic brain injury."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dural tube is a critical component of the craniosacral system, connecting the cranium to the sacrum and influencing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Restrictions in the dural tube can significantly impact the craniosacral rhythm, as discussed in L3 and L5."

            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing persistent digestive issues, including bloating and constipation. Considering the role of the diaphragms, which diaphragm would be MOST relevant to assess and potentially treat?",
            "options": ["Tentorium Cerebelli", "Urogenital Diaphragm", "Thoracic Diaphragm", "Hyoid Diaphragm"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Thoracic Diaphragm's position and influence on the vagus nerve (CN X), which innervates much of the digestive system, makes it the most relevant diaphragm to assess in cases of digestive issues, as detailed in L7."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of non-judgmental listening in craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["To diagnose the client's condition quickly and efficiently.", "To impose the therapist's beliefs and values on the client's healing process.", "To create a safe and supportive space for the client's body to express its needs.", "To provide direct advice and solutions to the client's problems."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-judgmental listening fosters a safe environment where the client's body can communicate its needs and facilitate self-correction, as emphasized in L2."

            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "According to research cited in L1, experienced craniosacral therapists often rely more on which type of information when assessing a client's condition?",
            "options": ["Detailed medical history and diagnostic imaging.", "Intuitive feelings and subjective impressions.", "Objective palpatory findings and subtle cues from the body.", "Verbal reports of pain and discomfort."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Experienced therapists tend to prioritize objective palpatory findings and subtle cues from the body, trusting their refined touch to guide their assessment and treatment, as discussed in L1."
