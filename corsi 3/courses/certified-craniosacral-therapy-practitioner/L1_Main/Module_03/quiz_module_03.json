            "question": "Which of the following best describes the principle of gentle engagement in Craniosacral Therapy?",
            "options": ["Applying firm pressure to overcome tissue resistance.", "Using a light touch, typically no more than 5 grams of pressure, to engage the body's self-corrective mechanisms.", "Quickly manipulating bony structures to restore alignment.", "Ignoring patient feedback to maintain therapeutic focus."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle engagement involves a light touch, around 5 grams, to facilitate the body's own healing processes without forcing change. This respects the body's inherent wisdom and promotes relaxation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "What is a 'vector crossing' and how is it utilized in Craniosacral Therapy?",
            "options": ["A point of maximum tissue resistance where direct force should be applied.", "The intersection of two or more lines of tension within the body, indicating an area where release may be facilitated.", "A specific bone landmark used for measuring cranial asymmetry.", "A technique involving rapid, percussive movements to break up adhesions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vector crossings represent areas where multiple lines of tension converge. Addressing these points with gentle techniques can release broader patterns of restriction throughout the body."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which of the following statements accurately describes the role of the diaphragm in primary respiration?",
            "options": ["The diaphragm is primarily involved in conscious breathing and has little impact on craniosacral rhythm.", "The respiratory diaphragm directly drives the movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).", "Restrictions in the respiratory diaphragm can affect the movement of CSF and impact the craniosacral system.", "The diaphragm's only function is to facilitate gas exchange in the lungs."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restrictions in the diaphragm can impede the flow of CSF and affect the overall craniosacral rhythm, highlighting its importance in CST."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "What is the primary goal of a Dural Tube Release?",
            "options": ["To directly manipulate the vertebrae.", "To release tension along the spinal cord and improve the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.", "To strengthen the muscles surrounding the spinal cord.", "To diagnose spinal pathologies using palpation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The dural tube surrounds the spinal cord, and releasing tension in this structure can improve CSF flow and alleviate neurological symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "The Sphenobasilar Joint (SBJ) is a key focus in Craniosacral Therapy. What is the primary movement dysfunction addressed at the SBJ?",
            "options": ["Lateral flexion/rotation.", "Compression and torsion.", "Extension and flexion.", "Anterior/Posterior glide."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SBJ compression and torsion patterns are common dysfunctions that can affect the entire craniosacral system. Decompression techniques aim to restore proper movement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic low back pain and a history of falls. Which sacral release technique would be MOST appropriate to begin with?",
            "options": ["Direct mobilization of the sacrum.", "Muscle Energy Technique (MET) to address iliosacral dysfunction.", "Balanced Ligamentous Tension (BLT) to address ligamentous strain patterns.", "Ignoring the sacrum and focusing solely on the lumbar spine."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BLT is gentle and addresses ligamentous strain patterns, making it ideal for clients with pain and instability, especially with a history of falls. It is a safe and effective starting point."

        {
            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "When integrating different Craniosacral Therapy techniques, what is the MOST important guiding principle?",
            "options": ["Following a pre-determined protocol regardless of the client's response.", "Prioritizing the techniques the therapist is most comfortable with.", "Following the body's inherent treatment plan and adapting techniques accordingly.", "Focusing solely on the area of primary complaint."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The body's inherent treatment plan should guide the therapist's choices. This involves listening to the tissues and adapting techniques based on the client's response."
        },
        {
            "id": "q3_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective way to document changes in a client's craniosacral rhythm after a session?",
            "options": ["Subjectively noting the therapist's impression of the rhythm.", "Using a standardized assessment tool to quantify changes in rhythm, tension patterns, and range of motion.", "Relying solely on the client's verbal feedback.", "Taking a photograph of the client's posture."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized assessment tools provide objective data to track progress and demonstrate the effectiveness of the therapy. Examples might include pre- and post-session palpation findings, pain scales, or range of motion measurements."

            "id": "q3_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic headaches and TMJ dysfunction. During your assessment, you notice significant tension at the sphenobasilar joint (SBJ) and restrictions in the dural tube. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate initial treatment strategy?",
            "options": ["Directly mobilizing the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).", "Immediately addressing the SBJ compression with a forceful technique.", "Gently releasing the dural tube to reduce overall tension before addressing the SBJ.", "Focusing solely on the client's reported pain location."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Releasing the dural tube first can reduce overall tension in the system, making the SBJ release more effective and comfortable for the client. This approach addresses the underlying patterns contributing to the symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q3_10",
            "question": "During a sacral release technique, you notice the client's body subtly shifts and releases tension in the upper thoracic region. What is the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Continue focusing solely on the sacrum until the intended release is achieved.", "Ignore the thoracic release and maintain focus on the original treatment plan.", "Gently follow the body's lead and address the thoracic region, recognizing the interconnectedness of the craniosacral system.", "Immediately stop the session and refer the client to another practitioner."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Following the body's lead is crucial in Craniosacral Therapy. The release in the thoracic region indicates that the body is responding and integrating the treatment in a holistic way."
