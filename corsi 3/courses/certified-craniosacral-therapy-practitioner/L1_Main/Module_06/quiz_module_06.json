        {
            "id": "q6_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary function of the respiratory diaphragm?",
            "options": ["Facilitating respiration", "Supporting postural stability", "Assisting lymphatic drainage", "Regulating intracranial pressure"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While the respiratory diaphragm influences overall body mechanics, its primary functions are related to respiration, postural support, and lymphatic drainage. Regulating intracranial pressure is more directly related to the cranial diaphragm (tentorium cerebelli)."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "During an assessment, you notice restricted movement and tenderness upon palpation of the sternal attachments of the respiratory diaphragm. This finding is MOST likely related to:",
            "options": ["Pelvic floor dysfunction", "Cranial nerve impingement", "Compensatory patterns from a lower limb injury", "Direct trauma to the abdomen"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Restrictions in the sternal attachments often arise from compensatory patterns originating elsewhere in the body, like the lower limbs. The body creates a chain of tension to maintain balance."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "The thoracic inlet is bounded by which of the following structures?",
            "options": ["Clavicle, first rib, and manubrium", "Scapula, second rib, and sternum", "Humerus, third rib, and xiphoid process", "T12 vertebrae, iliac crest, and sacrum"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The thoracic inlet (or outlet) is specifically bounded by the clavicle, first rib, and manubrium. Restrictions in this area can affect vascular and neurological structures passing through."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic constipation and lower back pain. Palpation reveals hypertonicity and tenderness in the pelvic diaphragm. Which muscle is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Diaphragm", "Psoas major", "Levator ani", "Rectus abdominis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The levator ani group forms the majority of the pelvic diaphragm. Hypertonicity here can directly contribute to constipation and refer pain to the lower back due to its attachments and influence on pelvic organ function."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "Which cranial nerve passes through the tentorium cerebelli and could be affected by restrictions in this dural structure?",
            "options": ["Olfactory nerve (CN I)", "Optic nerve (CN II)", "Trigeminal nerve (CN V)", "Facial nerve (CN VII)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The tentorium cerebelli is closely related to the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Restrictions can potentially impinge on this nerve, leading to facial pain, headaches, or other neurological symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "In the case study of Sarah, a 45-year-old with chronic migraines, releasing which diaphragm FIRST yielded the most significant reduction in headache frequency and intensity?",
            "options": ["Respiratory diaphragm", "Thoracic inlet", "Pelvic diaphragm", "Cranial diaphragm (tentorium cerebelli)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "In Sarah's case, addressing the cranial diaphragm (tentorium cerebelli) first was key to unlocking the other diaphragms. This highlights the importance of assessing the cranial base when treating chronic headaches."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_7",
            "question": "When performing a direct technique to release the respiratory diaphragm, what is the MOST important consideration for patient safety?",
            "options": ["Using maximal force to achieve release quickly", "Monitoring the client's breathing and comfort level", "Applying the technique bilaterally simultaneously", "Ignoring client feedback to maintain focus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Patient safety is paramount. Monitoring breathing and comfort ensures the technique is applied appropriately and avoids overstimulation or adverse reactions. Gentle and responsive application is key."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_8",
            "question": "Which of the following palpation qualities is MOST indicative of chronic restriction in a diaphragmatic structure?",
            "options": ["Warmth and pulsation", "Softness and pliability", "Coldness and rigidity", "Fluctuating movement"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic restrictions typically present with a feeling of coldness, density, and rigidity upon palpation, indicating decreased circulation and tissue mobility."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of anxiety and shallow breathing demonstrates limited excursion of the respiratory diaphragm. What breathing exercise would be MOST appropriate to initiate treatment?",
            "options": ["Rapid, forceful breathing", "Paradoxical breathing", "Diaphragmatic breathing with prolonged exhale", "Breath holding exercises"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing with a prolonged exhale helps to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation of the respiratory diaphragm. It encourages fuller, deeper breaths."
        },
        {
            "id": "q6_10",
            "question": "According to the presented research, approximately what percentage of individuals with chronic lower back pain also exhibit pelvic floor dysfunction?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 50-60% of individuals with chronic lower back pain also present with pelvic floor dysfunction, highlighting the interconnectedness of these regions and the importance of assessing both."
