            "id": "q14_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important aspect of attentive touch in craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Applying firm pressure to bony landmarks", "Maintaining a neutral and non-judgmental presence", "Actively manipulating restricted tissues", "Focusing solely on the client's verbal descriptions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attentive touch emphasizes a neutral presence to allow the client's system to guide the treatment. Active manipulation can override the body's inherent healing mechanisms."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic headaches and reports a history of whiplash. During dural membrane assessment, you identify a significant restriction at the sphenobasilar junction (SBJ). Which technique is MOST appropriate to begin addressing this restriction?",
            "options": ["Direct, forceful mobilization of the sphenoid bone", "Gentle, indirect release techniques focusing on the SBS", "Rapid, oscillatory movements of the occiput", "Ignoring the SBS and focusing on the cervical spine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle, indirect techniques are preferred for addressing dural restrictions, particularly at the SBS. Forceful techniques can be counterproductive and potentially harmful, especially post-whiplash."

        {
            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which cranial nerve is primarily responsible for parasympathetic innervation of the abdominal organs?",
            "options": ["Trigeminal nerve (CN V)", "Facial nerve (CN VII)", "Vagus nerve (CN X)", "Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The vagus nerve (CN X) is the primary cranial nerve responsible for parasympathetic innervation of the abdominal organs, playing a crucial role in digestion and regulation."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "A client presents with TMJ dysfunction, reporting clicking and pain. Upon intraoral examination, you notice hypertonicity of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Which of the following craniosacral techniques would be MOST appropriate to address this?",
            "options": ["Forceful stretching of the masseter muscle", "Gentle, sustained pressure on the lateral pterygoid muscle intraorally", "Rapid, oscillatory movements of the mandible", "Ignoring the intraoral findings and focusing on the cervical spine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle, sustained pressure allows the muscle to release without causing further trauma. Forceful techniques can exacerbate the condition."

        {
            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following factors MOST directly influences the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?",
            "options": ["Dietary intake of sodium", "Cranial rhythmic impulse (CRI)", "External temperature", "Mental focus"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The CRI, generated by the inherent motility of the central nervous system, is a primary driver of CSF flow. While other factors may indirectly influence health, they don't directly affect CSF flow to the same extent."
        },
        {
            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "In SomatoEmotional Release (SER), what is the significance of 'therapeutic stillness'?",
            "options": ["A technique to forcefully suppress emotional expression", "A passive waiting period before any intervention", "A state of deep listening and non-interference to facilitate the client's process", "A method to distract the client from their emotions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic stillness is about creating a safe space for the client to access and process emotions without judgment or interference. It's a state of deep listening that allows the client's inherent healing capacity to emerge."

        {
            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A client undergoing chemotherapy experiences persistent nausea and fatigue. Besides craniosacral therapy, which of the following modalities would be MOST complementary and warrant a referral?",
            "options": ["Chiropractic adjustment focused on spinal manipulation", "Acupuncture for symptom management and energy balancing", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Deep tissue massage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acupuncture is often used to manage the side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea and fatigue, and can be a valuable adjunct to craniosacral therapy. HIIT and deep tissue massage may be too strenuous for a client undergoing chemotherapy."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "In a complex case involving chronic pain, anxiety, and TMJ dysfunction, what is the MOST important initial step in treatment planning?",
            "options": ["Immediately addressing the most painful symptom", "Developing a comprehensive assessment of all contributing factors", "Focusing solely on the TMJ dysfunction", "Ignoring the client's emotional state"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive assessment helps identify the root causes and interrelationships between different symptoms, allowing for a more effective and holistic treatment plan. Addressing only the most painful symptom may neglect underlying issues."

            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client named Sarah presents with chronic neck pain and headaches following a car accident six months ago. Her craniosacral evaluation reveals restrictions in the dural membranes, particularly around the foramen magnum. She also reports feeling anxious and overwhelmed. Based on this information, which of the following treatment approaches is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Aggressively mobilize the cervical spine to restore range of motion.", "Begin with gentle dural membrane release techniques, addressing the foramen magnum and incorporating techniques to support emotional regulation.", "Refer her immediately for psychiatric evaluation and medication.", "Focus solely on the musculoskeletal components of her neck pain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the dural restrictions and reported anxiety, a gentle, integrated approach that addresses both the physical and emotional components is most appropriate. Aggressive mobilization could exacerbate her condition, and while a psychiatric referral might be considered later, it's not the immediate priority."

        {
            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of monitoring the Arcing rhythm during CSF refinement techniques?",
            "options": ["To measure the client's heart rate variability.", "To assess the amplitude and symmetry of the CRI and CSF flow.", "To determine the client's emotional state.", "To identify bony misalignments in the cranium."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Monitoring the Arcing rhythm allows the practitioner to assess the quality and balance of the CRI and CSF flow, providing valuable feedback during CSF refinement techniques. It's not directly related to heart rate variability, emotional state, or bony misalignments."
