            "id": "q8_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the sphenobasilar junction (SBJ)?",
            "options": ["A cartilaginous joint allowing free movement.", "A synostosis that remains fused throughout life.", "A complex articulation influenced by cranial, dural, and muscular tensions.", "A simple hinge joint primarily affecting jaw movement."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The SBJ is a complex articulation highly influenced by various tensions, as emphasized in the Advanced Palpation Techniques lesson. Its movement is subtle and influenced by many factors."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic neck pain and headaches. During therapeutic listening, you notice a consistent pattern of resistance and holding in their sacrum. According to the principles discussed in this module, what is the MOST appropriate initial approach?",
            "options": ["Immediately address the cranial base to release any restrictions.", "Focus solely on the sacrum to release the holding pattern.", "Explore the potential relationship between the sacrum and cranial base, and address the area of greatest restriction first.", "Refer the client for immediate spinal manipulation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The principle of therapeutic listening suggests identifying the area of greatest restriction and addressing it first. The sacrum and cranial base are interconnected, making it important to assess both."

            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key anatomical connection to consider when addressing diaphragmatic restrictions?",
            "options": ["The common carotid artery", "The appendix", "The falx cerebri", "The psoas muscle"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The psoas muscle has significant fascial connections to the diaphragm, influencing its function and mobility. Restrictions in the psoas can directly impact diaphragmatic movement."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "When working with the dural tube, which structure is MOST directly influenced by tension in the filum terminale?",
            "options": ["The tentorium cerebelli", "The foramen magnum", "The sacrum", "The temporomandibular joint"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The filum terminale attaches to the coccyx, making the sacrum the structure most directly influenced by its tension. This connection can impact the entire dural tube."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "A client reports digestive issues alongside chronic lower back pain. Integrating visceral techniques, which organ would be MOST relevant to assess in relation to the lumbar spine?",
            "options": ["The heart", "The liver", "The kidneys", "The spleen"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The kidneys are located in the retroperitoneal space and have direct fascial connections to the lumbar spine. Addressing kidney mobility can often alleviate lower back pain."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "A client presents with TMJ dysfunction and reports clicking and popping in the jaw. Which muscle is MOST likely to be involved in causing anterior displacement of the articular disc?",
            "options": ["The masseter", "The temporalis", "The lateral pterygoid", "The medial pterygoid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for protruding the mandible and can contribute to anterior displacement of the articular disc if it is hypertonic or imbalanced."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "When treating an infant with torticollis, what is the MOST important consideration regarding the craniosacral system?",
            "options": ["Forcing correction of the neck muscles immediately.", "Ignoring the cranial base and focusing only on the neck.", "Addressing any cranial strains that may be contributing to the muscular imbalance.", "Assuming the condition will resolve on its own."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cranial strains, particularly at the occiput and temporal bones, can contribute to torticollis in infants. Addressing these strains is crucial for long-term resolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "In the ALIGN framework, what does the 'N' represent?",
            "options": ["Neuromuscular re-education", "Nervous system regulation", "Nutritional support", "Narrative reframing"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the ALIGN framework, 'N' stands for Nervous system regulation. This involves addressing the autonomic nervous system to promote balance and healing."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A 6-year-old child presents with recurrent ear infections and behavioral issues. Parents report the child had a difficult birth involving forceps. Which cranial bone is MOST likely to be restricted and contributing to these issues?",
            "options": ["The frontal bone", "The parietal bone", "The temporal bone", "The ethmoid bone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The temporal bone houses the inner ear and is often affected by birth trauma, especially with forceps delivery. Restrictions here can contribute to ear infections and impact the vagus nerve, influencing behavior."

            "id": "q8_10",
            "question": "According to the case study of Sarah, a 45-year-old client with chronic migraines, which of the following cranial bones was MOST significantly addressed to reduce her migraine frequency?",
            "options": ["The frontal bone", "The occiput", "The sphenoid", "The ethmoid"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the case study of Sarah, the sphenoid bone was found to have significant restrictions impacting the dural attachments and cranial nerve function, which were addressed to reduce her migraine frequency."
