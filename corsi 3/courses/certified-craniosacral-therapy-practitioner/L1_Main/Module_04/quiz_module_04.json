            "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary goal of integration in Craniosacral Therapy?",
            "options": ["To eliminate all restrictions in the craniosacral system.", "To facilitate the nervous system's ability to self-regulate and find balance.", "To force the body into a perfectly symmetrical alignment.", "To suppress emotional responses during treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integration focuses on enhancing the nervous system's inherent capacity for self-regulation, rather than forceful correction."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on the nervous system's role in integration, which branch of the autonomic nervous system is typically associated with the 'fight or flight' response and can hinder the integration process?",
            "options": ["Parasympathetic nervous system.", "Sympathetic nervous system.", "Enteric nervous system.", "Central nervous system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the 'fight or flight' response, which can create tension and resistance during integration."

            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious during a Craniosacral Therapy session. Which verbal communication technique would be MOST appropriate to support integration?",
            "options": ["Instructing the client to 'just relax'.", "Asking the client to describe the sensation in detail and explore any associated emotions.", "Ignoring the client's anxiety and continuing with the planned protocol.", "Sharing your own personal experiences with anxiety to create rapport."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and exploring the client's experience allows for processing and integration of the emotional component."

            "options": ["To forcefully release restrictions in the craniosacral system.", "To create a pause that allows the nervous system to reset and reorganize.", "To induce a state of deep sleep in the client.", "To diagnose specific cranial faults."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Still points provide a temporary cessation of movement, allowing the nervous system to recalibrate and promote integration."
