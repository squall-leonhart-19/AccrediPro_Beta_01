            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important consideration when performing advanced diaphragm release techniques?",
            "options": ["Applying maximum pressure for quicker release", "Maintaining client comfort and monitoring their response", "Focusing solely on the central tendon", "Ignoring client feedback to achieve optimal results"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Client comfort and responsiveness are paramount in advanced diaphragm release. Overly aggressive techniques can be counterproductive and potentially harmful."

            "options": ["Sphenoid bone", "Hyoid bone and Larynx", "Sacrum", "Temporal bone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The hyoid bone and larynx are directly involved in swallowing and vocalization. Restrictions in this area can significantly impact these functions."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The rhythmic expansion and contraction of the cranial bones and sacrum, along with CSF production, create a peristaltic-like action that drives CSF circulation."
