            "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'attentive touch' in craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Applying deep pressure to release muscle tension.", "Using light, non-invasive contact to perceive subtle movements and rhythms.", "Performing rapid, repetitive movements to stimulate nerve endings.", "Employing forceful techniques to correct structural misalignments."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Attentive touch emphasizes gentle, receptive contact to perceive subtle physiological cues, rather than forceful manipulation."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "Which cranial nerve is primarily responsible for taste sensation in the posterior third of the tongue?",
            "options": ["Facial nerve (VII)", "Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX)", "Vagus nerve (X)", "Hypoglossal nerve (XII)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is responsible for taste sensation in the posterior third of the tongue, as well as general sensation in the pharynx."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary motion associated with the sphenoid bone?",
            "options": ["Flexion", "Extension", "Torsion", "Lateral Strain"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Lateral strain is a dysfunction pattern involving the sphenoid and occiput, not a primary motion of the sphenoid itself."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client presents with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction and reports clicking and pain upon jaw movement. Which temporal bone landmark is MOST relevant to assess?",
            "options": ["Petrous ridge", "Squamous portion", "Mastoid process", "Styloid process"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The petrous ridge houses the inner ear and directly articulates with the sphenoid bone, influencing TMJ function through dural attachments and cranial base mechanics."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which diaphragm is most directly influenced by breathing patterns and can significantly impact the craniosacral system?",
            "options": ["Pelvic diaphragm", "Thoracic diaphragm", "Hyoid diaphragm", "Tentorium cerebelli"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The thoracic diaphragm's movement during respiration directly affects intra-abdominal pressure and venous return, influencing the craniosacral rhythm."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the A.L.I.G.N. Framework™, 'A' represents Assessment, the initial step in evaluating the client's condition."

            "question": "When working with infants, which of the following is the MOST important consideration regarding the pressure applied during palpation?",
            "options": ["Applying firm pressure to encourage movement", "Using the same pressure as with adults", "Applying extremely light, almost imperceptible pressure", "Avoiding palpation of fontanelles"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Infants have delicate structures, requiring extremely light pressure to avoid overstimulation or harm. Palpation should be gentle and respectful of their developing systems."

            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "A craniosacral therapist experiences persistent neck pain and fatigue after treating several clients with complex trauma histories. Which self-care practice is MOST likely to address both physical and emotional well-being?",
            "options": ["Strenuous exercise", "Mindfulness meditation and somatic experiencing", "Avoiding client interaction", "Increasing caffeine intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation and somatic experiencing can help process vicarious trauma and reduce physical tension, promoting both emotional and physical well-being."

            "options": ["10%", "35%", "60%", "85%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Ramirez et al. (2023) case study reported a 60% improvement in sleep quality in infants with colic following craniosacral therapy interventions."

            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST reflects the relationship between the dura mater and the sacrum?",
            "options": ["The dura mater directly attaches to the sacrum, influencing its movement.", "The dura mater has no direct connection to the sacrum.", "The dura mater indirectly connects to the sacrum via the filum terminale.", "The dura mater connects to the sacrum via the coccyx."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The dura mater attaches to the foramen magnum and the second and third cervical vertebrae. It extends as the filum terminale internum to attach to the posterior aspect of the coccyx, indirectly influencing sacral movement."
