            "question": "Which of the following palpation techniques is MOST effective for assessing subtle restrictions within the sphenoid bone's pterygoid processes?",
            "options": ["Direct compression", "Lateral traction with broad contact", "Gentle, sustained traction with a fingertip contact", "Rapid, oscillatory movements"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gentle, sustained traction with a fingertip contact allows for focused assessment of subtle restrictions within the pterygoid processes. Direct compression and rapid oscillatory movements are less sensitive for detecting subtle restrictions. Lateral traction, while useful in some contexts, doesn't provide the precision needed here."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic headaches and a history of whiplash. During dural membrane balancing, you identify a significant restriction at the tentorium cerebelli. Which of the following techniques is MOST appropriate to address this restriction?",
            "options": ["Rapid, forceful release", "Gentle, sustained traction along the transverse sinus groove", "Direct compression of the occiput", "Ignoring the tentorium and focusing on the falx cerebri"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gentle, sustained traction along the transverse sinus groove is the most appropriate technique. The tentorium cerebelli is a dural membrane, and gentle, sustained techniques are generally indicated. Rapid forceful release is contraindicated. Focusing solely on the falx cerebri would ignore the primary restriction. Direct compression of the occiput might exacerbate the condition."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "Stimulation of the vagus nerve via the craniosacral system primarily influences which of the following physiological responses?",
            "options": ["Increased sympathetic tone", "Decreased heart rate and increased digestive activity", "Increased respiratory rate and decreased digestive activity", "Suppression of immune function"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vagal nerve stimulation promotes parasympathetic activity, leading to decreased heart rate and increased digestive activity. The craniosacral system can influence the vagus nerve through its connection to the dura and cranial nerves."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "When addressing temporal bone restrictions, which of the following is MOST crucial to consider due to the proximity of vital structures?",
            "options": ["The client's emotional state", "The position of the opposite temporal bone", "The internal and external auditory canals and the temporomandibular joint", "The color of the client's aura"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The internal and external auditory canals and the temporomandibular joint are crucial considerations due to their proximity to the temporal bones and the potential for iatrogenic effects. Ignoring these structures could lead to adverse outcomes."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "According to the lesson on Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) dynamics, what percentage of CSF is reabsorbed into the venous sinuses daily?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-50%", "60-80%", "90-100%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Approximately 90-100% of CSF is reabsorbed into the venous sinuses daily. This high turnover rate highlights the importance of proper CSF circulation for brain health."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic neck pain and limited range of motion. You identify fascial restrictions in the cervical spine and cranial base. What is the MOST appropriate sequence to integrate craniosacral therapy with myofascial release?",
            "options": ["Begin with direct myofascial release of the neck muscles, followed by craniosacral techniques", "Alternate between myofascial release and craniosacral techniques in a single session", "Begin with craniosacral techniques to address cranial base restrictions, followed by myofascial release of the cervical spine", "Perform craniosacral therapy in one session and myofascial release in a separate session"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing cranial base restrictions with craniosacral techniques first can help to release tension patterns that contribute to cervical spine dysfunction, making the subsequent myofascial release more effective. Starting with direct myofascial release could exacerbate cranial restrictions."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'listening skills' in advanced craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Actively listening to the client's verbal description of their symptoms", "Developing the ability to perceive subtle rhythmic movements and energy patterns within the craniosacral system", "Using a stethoscope to listen to CSF flow", "Ignoring the client's verbal cues and focusing solely on palpation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Listening skills' in craniosacral therapy refers to the practitioner's ability to perceive subtle rhythmic movements and energy patterns within the craniosacral system through palpation and intuition."

            "id": "q12_8",
            "question": "A client reports feeling overwhelmed and anxious after each CST session. Which of the following treatment planning strategies is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Discontinue CST immediately", "Increase the intensity and duration of each session to facilitate deeper release", "Shorten the session duration, focus on gentle techniques, and incorporate grounding exercises", "Refer the client to a psychiatrist"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Shortening the session duration, focusing on gentle techniques, and incorporating grounding exercises can help the client process the changes induced by CST without feeling overwhelmed. Discontinuing CST or increasing intensity could be counterproductive."

            "id": "q12_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is an advanced palpation technique used to assess the mobility of the petrous portion of the temporal bone?",
            "options": ["Direct compression of the mastoid process", "Gentle rocking of the mandible", "Bilateral traction on the zygomatic arches", "Internal listening with a finger placed gently inside the external auditory meatus."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Internal listening, involving gentle placement of a finger inside the external auditory meatus, allows for a sensitive assessment of the petrous portion of the temporal bone's mobility and subtle restrictions. Direct compression and bilateral traction are less specific. Gentle rocking of the mandible primarily assesses TMJ function."

            "id": "q12_10",
            "question": "A client with trigeminal neuralgia reports increased pain following a CST session. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in treatment planning?",
            "options": ["Increase the frequency of sessions to desensitize the nerve", "Apply ice packs to the affected area and continue with the original treatment plan", "Re-evaluate the treatment plan, focusing on gentle techniques that address dural tension and cranial nerve pathways, and educate the client about potential temporary symptom exacerbation", "Refer the client for surgery immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Re-evaluating the treatment plan and focusing on gentle techniques is the most appropriate approach. Trigeminal neuralgia can be sensitive, and gentle techniques that address dural tension and cranial nerve pathways are often more effective. Educating the client about potential temporary symptom exacerbation is also important. Increasing session frequency or immediately referring for surgery are not the best initial steps."
