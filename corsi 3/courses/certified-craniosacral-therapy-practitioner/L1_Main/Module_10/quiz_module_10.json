    {
      "id": "q10_1",
      "question": "Which of the following is a key consideration when performing diaphragm releases on infants, as highlighted in our case studies?",
      "options": [
        "Applying firm pressure to achieve immediate release.",
        "Focusing on gentle, indirect techniques to respect the infant's delicate system.",
        "Using quick, forceful movements to break up restrictions.",
        "Ignoring the craniosacral rhythm to expedite the treatment."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Infants require gentle, indirect techniques due to their developing musculoskeletal system. Forceful techniques can be harmful and counterproductive."

    {
      "id": "q10_2",
      "question": "During advanced hyoid bone work, what is the primary goal when addressing restrictions?",
      "options": [
        "To forcefully manipulate the hyoid into a 'corrected' position.",
        "To create space and balance within the surrounding structures, including the cervical spine and cranial base.",
        "To ignore the fascial connections to the mandible.",
        "To focus solely on the muscular attachments without considering ligamentous influences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The hyoid bone's position is influenced by multiple structures. Releasing restrictions in the surrounding tissues is key to achieving long-term balance."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10_3",
      "question": "A client presents with chronic headaches and a history of whiplash. When assessing the dural tube, which area is MOST likely to exhibit restriction?",
      "options": [
        "The sacrum.",
        "The foramen magnum and upper cervical region.",
        "The coccyx.",
        "The lumbar spine."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Whiplash injuries often affect the upper cervical region, leading to dural tube restrictions at the foramen magnum."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10_4",
      "question": "In advanced cranial base techniques, what is the significance of the sphenobasilar synchondrosis (SBS)?",
      "options": [
        "It is a fixed joint with no movement.",
        "It is a primary respiratory mechanism with subtle motion that influences the entire craniosacral system.",
        "It is only relevant in pediatric cases.",
        "It is only relevant for balancing the sacrum."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The SBS is a key articulation in the cranial base. Its subtle movement is crucial for optimal craniosacral function."

    {
      "id": "q10_5",
      "question": "A 6-month-old infant presents with torticollis and difficulty latching during breastfeeding. Which craniosacral structure is MOST likely involved?",
      "options": [
        "The sacrum.",
        "The frontal bone.",
        "The temporal bone and associated structures.",
        "The coccyx."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The temporal bones house the structures related to balance and are near the muscles involved in jaw movement and neck rotation. Restrictions here are commonly associated with torticollis and latching difficulties."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10_6",
      "question": "When integrating visceral manipulation with CST, which of the following statements is MOST accurate?",
      "options": [
        "Visceral restrictions have no impact on the craniosacral system.",
        "Visceral restrictions can directly influence cranial bone mobility and dural tension.",
        "CST should always be performed before visceral manipulation.",
        "Visceral manipulation should only be used for digestive issues."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The fascial connections between the viscera and the craniosacral system mean that visceral restrictions can have a direct impact on cranial bone mobility and dural tension."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10_7",
      "question": "What is the primary focus of advanced TMJ dysfunction techniques in CST?",
      "options": [
        "Forcibly realigning the jaw joint.",
        "Balancing the sphenoid, temporal bones, and mandible to restore optimal joint mechanics.",
        "Ignoring the cervical spine's influence on TMJ function.",
        "Focusing solely on the masseter and temporalis muscles."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "TMJ dysfunction often involves imbalances in the cranial bones and cervical spine. Addressing these structures is essential for effective treatment."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10_8",
      "question": "A client presents with a complex case involving chronic pain, anxiety, and digestive issues. What is the FIRST step in developing an effective treatment plan?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately beginning the most advanced CST technique.",
        "Performing a thorough assessment to identify the primary restrictions and contributing factors.",
        "Focusing solely on the area of greatest pain.",
        "Ignoring the client's emotional state."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A comprehensive assessment is crucial for understanding the interconnectedness of the client's symptoms and developing a targeted treatment plan."

      "id": "q10_9",
      "question": "A study cited in the module indicated that infants with colic often exhibit restrictions in which cranial nerve?",
      "options": [
        "The olfactory nerve (CN I)",
        "The trigeminal nerve (CN V)",
        "The vagus nerve (CN X)",
        "The optic nerve (CN II)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The vagus nerve (CN X) plays a significant role in digestive function. Restrictions affecting this nerve can contribute to colic in infants."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10_10",
      "question": "When addressing restrictions in the dural tube, which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the sacrum's role?",
      "options": [
        "The sacrum has no direct influence on dural tube tension.",
        "Sacral restrictions can directly impact dural tube tension and craniosacral rhythm.",
        "The sacrum is only relevant in cases of lower back pain.",
        "Releasing the sacrum will always resolve cranial restrictions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The dural tube attaches to the sacrum, making sacral restrictions a significant factor in dural tube tension and overall craniosacral function."
