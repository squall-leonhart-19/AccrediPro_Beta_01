            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary layer assessed during layered palpation techniques?",
            "options": ["Skin and superficial fascia", "Muscles and tendons", "Visceral organs", "Bones and deep fascia"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Layered palpation focuses on the somatic layers (skin, fascia, muscles, bones) to identify restrictions and imbalances, not directly on visceral organs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "During cranial base assessment, a restriction in flexion at the sphenobasilar junction (SBJ) is MOST likely to present with:",
            "options": ["Increased cranial rhythmic impulse (CRI)", "Decreased cranial rhythmic impulse (CRI)", "Lateral strain pattern", "Vertical strain pattern"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Flexion restriction at the SBJ typically dampens the CRI due to impaired dural and fluid dynamics, as discussed in the lesson on Sphenobasilar Junction Dynamics."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client presents with low back pain radiating into the left leg. During sacral assessment, you note a decreased mobility of the left sacroiliac (SI) joint and tenderness upon palpation of the left sacrotuberous ligament. This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["An anterior sacral torsion on the right", "A posterior sacral torsion on the left", "A bilateral sacral flexion", "A cranial lesion affecting sacral motion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Posterior sacral torsions are often associated with decreased SI joint mobility and ligamentous tenderness on the same side, mimicking sciatic-like symptoms. The lesson on Sacral Assessment covers these patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on the Dural Sleeve, what is the primary attachment point of the dural sleeve in the cervical region that can significantly impact spinal cord tension?",
            "options": ["C2", "Foramen Magnum", "C7", "T1"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The dural sleeve has significant attachments at C2, making it a key area for assessing and addressing spinal cord tension. Restrictions here can have widespread effects."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "During assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, a practitioner notices a palpable 'drag' or resistance in the sagittal sinus. This MOST likely indicates:",
            "options": ["Increased CSF production", "Obstruction to CSF outflow", "Normal CSF dynamics", "Increased arterial pulsations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Resistance or 'drag' in the sagittal sinus suggests an impediment to CSF drainage, potentially leading to increased intracranial pressure. This is a key finding in Fluid Dynamics assessment."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Which diaphragm is MOST directly involved in regulating pressure gradients between the thorax and the abdomen, impacting lymphatic and venous return?",
            "options": ["Pelvic diaphragm", "Thoracic diaphragm", "Cranial diaphragm", "Hyoid diaphragm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The thoracic diaphragm's movement during respiration creates pressure differentials crucial for lymphatic and venous flow between the thoracic and abdominal cavities, as highlighted in the Diaphragm Assessment lesson."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic headaches, TMJ dysfunction, and a history of whiplash. Integrating assessment findings, which area should be addressed FIRST to have the MOST global impact?",
            "options": ["Temporomandibular joint", "Cranial base (SBJ)", "Cervical spine (C2)", "Thoracic diaphragm"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the cranial base (SBJ) often has the most global impact due to its central role in dural tension and CSF dynamics, influencing both cranial and spinal mechanics. This is a principle emphasized in the Integrating Assessment Findings lesson."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important element to include when documenting assessment findings for craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Subjective complaints only", "Objective findings and their correlation to subjective complaints", "Billing codes", "Personal opinions about the client's condition"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Documentation should focus on correlating objective findings from palpation and assessment with the client's subjective complaints to create a clear and comprehensive record. The Documentation lesson emphasizes this."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client reports a history of falls and presents with difficulty coordinating movements. During your assessment, you find restrictions in the craniosacral system and impaired CSF flow. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Directly mobilize the sacrum", "Release restrictions at the cranial base to improve CSF flow", "Strengthen abdominal muscles", "Prescribe pain medication"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the client's neurological symptoms and assessment findings, addressing restrictions at the cranial base to enhance CSF flow is a logical initial step to improve overall craniosacral function and potentially impact coordination, as discussed in the Integration lesson."

        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "In a case study presented in the lesson, a 45-year-old client with chronic migraines showed significant improvement after addressing restrictions in which structure?",
            "options": ["The pelvic diaphragm", "The tentorium cerebelli", "The psoas muscle", "The temporalis muscle"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study highlighted the importance of the tentorium cerebelli in migraine management, as releasing restrictions in this dural structure led to a notable reduction in the client's headache frequency and intensity."
