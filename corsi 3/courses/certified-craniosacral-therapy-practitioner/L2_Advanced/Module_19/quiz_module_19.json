            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following research methodologies is considered the 'gold standard' for establishing cause-and-effect relationships?",
            "options": ["Case Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)", "Observational Study", "Cross-Sectional Study"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs are considered the gold standard due to their ability to minimize bias through randomization and control groups, allowing for stronger causal inferences."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "When critically appraising CST research, what does 'blinding' refer to?",
            "options": ["Concealing the treatment allocation from participants", "Concealing the treatment allocation from researchers assessing outcomes", "Concealing the treatment allocation from data analysts", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Blinding, when effectively implemented, minimizes bias from both participants and researchers, strengthening the validity of the study's findings."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to the systematic review discussed in L3, what is a key limitation in the existing body of evidence for Craniosacral Therapy?",
            "options": ["Lack of theoretical framework", "Small sample sizes and heterogeneity of study designs", "High cost of interventions", "Difficulty in recruiting participants"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews consistently point to the limitations of small sample sizes and varying methodologies as significant challenges in drawing definitive conclusions about CST's efficacy."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the placebo effect in the context of CST?",
            "options": ["A physiological response to a sham treatment.", "A psychological expectation of improvement that influences the perceived outcome.", "A genuine therapeutic effect of CST regardless of patient belief.", "A statistical anomaly that occurs in poorly designed studies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The placebo effect is primarily a psychological phenomenon where expectations influence perceived outcomes, making it crucial to control for in CST research."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A 2019 study by Haller et al. investigated the effect of CST on chronic neck pain. What was a key finding of this study?",
            "options": ["CST was significantly more effective than standard medical care.", "CST showed similar effectiveness to sham therapy in reducing pain intensity.", "CST exacerbated symptoms in a majority of participants.", "CST demonstrated long-term benefits lasting over 12 months."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Haller et al. study (2019) found that CST was not superior to sham therapy for chronic neck pain, highlighting the importance of controlling for the placebo effect."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "In the context of research on CST for neurological conditions, what is one potential challenge in designing a study with a control group?",
            "options": ["Ethical considerations in withholding potentially beneficial treatment.", "Difficulty in finding participants with neurological conditions.", "Lack of standardized outcome measures for neurological symptoms.", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Withholding potentially beneficial treatment raises ethical concerns, especially in vulnerable populations with neurological conditions. This often necessitates creative control group designs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When designing a CST research project, what is the purpose of a power analysis?",
            "options": ["To determine the statistical significance of the results.", "To estimate the sample size needed to detect a meaningful effect.", "To calculate the cost of the research project.", "To identify potential confounding variables."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A power analysis helps researchers determine the appropriate sample size to ensure that the study has sufficient statistical power to detect a real effect if one exists."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key component of effective communication of CST research findings?",
            "options": ["Using clear and concise language.", "Acknowledging limitations of the study.", "Exaggerating the benefits of CST to attract attention.", "Presenting data accurately and transparently."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exaggerating benefits is unethical and undermines the credibility of the research. Honest and balanced reporting is crucial for effective communication."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, with fibromyalgia, participated in a CST study. After 8 weeks of treatment, she reported a 30% reduction in pain levels and improved sleep quality. While encouraging, what is a key limitation in drawing conclusions from Sarah's individual experience?",
            "options": ["Sarah's age may influence treatment outcomes.", "Individual experiences are subject to bias and cannot establish causality.", "Fibromyalgia is not responsive to CST.", "Sarah's results are statistically insignificant."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individual case reports, while valuable for generating hypotheses, are prone to bias and cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships like controlled studies can."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "You are presenting CST research findings to a group of medical professionals. What is the most important consideration when discussing the clinical significance of your results?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on statistical significance (p-value).", "Emphasizing the potential cost savings of CST.", "Explaining the practical impact of the findings on patient care and quality of life.", "Avoiding any discussion of limitations."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Clinical significance refers to the practical importance of the findings in terms of their impact on patient outcomes and clinical decision-making. It goes beyond statistical significance to consider the real-world relevance of the results."
