            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the case study involving complex trauma, which of the following craniosacral therapy techniques was MOST emphasized in addressing the client's somatic holding patterns?",
            "options": ["Venous Sinus Drainage", "Direction of Energy (DOE)", "Dural Tube Mobilization", "Still Point Induction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Direction of Energy (DOE) was most emphasized for addressing somatic holding patterns as it allows the therapist to follow and support the body's inherent healing process in releasing trauma-related restrictions."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 4-month-old infant presents with difficulty latching and poor weight gain. Based on the case study, which cranial nerve is MOST likely to be assessed and potentially addressed with craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Olfactory Nerve (CN I)", "Trigeminal Nerve (CN V)", "Vagus Nerve (CN X)", "Abducens Nerve (CN VI)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Vagus Nerve (CN X) plays a crucial role in digestion, swallowing, and overall autonomic regulation, making it a primary focus in infants with feeding difficulties. Issues with CN X can directly impact latching and weight gain."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the case study of craniosacral therapy for autoimmune conditions, which of the following systems was targeted to modulate the immune response?",
            "options": ["Skeletal System", "Cardiovascular System", "Lymphatic System", "Endocrine System"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lymphatic system is a key component of the immune system. Craniosacral therapy techniques can help improve lymphatic drainage and circulation, which can help modulate the immune response in autoimmune conditions."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "When palpating the sphenobasilar joint (SBJ), which movement indicates a torsion pattern?",
            "options": ["The sphenoid and occiput rotate in the same direction around a vertical axis.", "The sphenoid and occiput flex and extend in unison.", "The sphenoid and occiput rotate in opposite directions around an anteroposterior axis.", "The sphenoid and occiput move freely without any restriction."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A torsion pattern at the SBJ is characterized by the sphenoid and occiput rotating in the SAME direction around a vertical axis. This creates a twisting strain pattern within the craniosacral system."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "A client is undergoing extensive dental work, including multiple extractions and implants. What is the PRIMARY goal of craniosacral therapy in this context?",
            "options": ["To accelerate bone remodeling.", "To reduce post-operative pain and inflammation and balance cranial strain patterns.", "To replace the need for pain medication entirely.", "To prevent any shifting of the teeth post-procedure."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Craniosacral therapy aims to reduce post-operative pain and inflammation, balance cranial strain patterns caused by dental work, and support the body's natural healing processes after dental procedures."

        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "In the case study involving neurological conditions, a client with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) reported persistent headaches and dizziness. Which craniosacral technique would be MOST appropriate to address these symptoms initially?",
            "options": ["Frontal Lift", "CV-4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle)", "Sacral Rocking", "Vault Hold"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CV-4 (Compression of the Fourth Ventricle) is often used initially in mTBI cases to help regulate cerebrospinal fluid flow and reduce intracranial pressure, which can alleviate headaches and dizziness."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "Which of the following scenarios represents a clear ethical violation within the scope of advanced craniosacral therapy practice?",
            "options": ["Providing craniosacral therapy to a minor with parental consent.", "Guaranteeing a specific outcome or cure for a client's condition.", "Referring a client to another healthcare professional when necessary.", "Maintaining client confidentiality and privacy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Guaranteeing a specific outcome or cure is an ethical violation because craniosacral therapy outcomes can vary, and promising a cure is outside the scope of practice and can mislead clients."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "The A.L.I.G.N. framework emphasizes which core principle in advanced craniosacral therapy?",
            "options": ["Aggressive manipulation of cranial bones.", "Limiting client interaction to reduce transference.", "Integration of anatomy, listening skills, intention, grounding, and non-judgment.", "Ignoring the client's subjective experience."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The A.L.I.G.N. framework stands for Anatomy, Listening, Intention, Grounding, and Non-judgment. It emphasizes the importance of integrating these principles for effective and ethical craniosacral therapy practice."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic lower back pain and a history of emotional trauma. According to the principles discussed in the complex trauma case study, what is the MOST important initial step in their treatment?",
            "options": ["Immediately addressing the sacral base restriction.", "Establishing a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship.", "Performing a direct release of the psoas muscle.", "Ignoring the emotional component and focusing solely on structural imbalances."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a safe and trusting therapeutic relationship is paramount when working with clients who have a history of trauma. This creates a foundation for effective treatment and helps prevent re-traumatization."

            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "When working with infants experiencing feeding difficulties, which of the following signs might indicate a restriction in the hyoid bone's mobility?",
            "options": ["Symmetrical head shape.", "Effortless tongue movement.", "Gagging or choking during feeding.", "Strong and coordinated suckling reflex."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gagging or choking during feeding can be indicative of a restriction in the hyoid bone's mobility. The hyoid bone plays a crucial role in swallowing and tongue movement; restrictions can interfere with these functions."
