            "question": "Which of the following databases is MOST suitable for finding peer-reviewed research articles related to Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT)?",
            "options": ["Google", "Wikipedia", "PubMed", "WebMD"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PubMed specializes in biomedical literature, including research relevant to AAT, offering access to peer-reviewed studies and systematic reviews."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a systematic review in AAT research?",
            "options": ["To provide a general overview of a topic.", "To statistically combine the results of multiple studies to draw conclusions about the overall effect of an intervention.", "To present a single researcher's opinion on a specific AAT technique.", "To describe a single case study in detail."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews use rigorous methods to identify, appraise, and synthesize all relevant studies on a specific topic, often including meta-analysis to statistically combine results."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of AAT for reducing anxiety in children, the 'control group' would typically receive:",
            "options": ["The AAT intervention.", "A different form of therapy.", "No intervention or a standard care intervention.", "A placebo animal interaction."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The control group serves as a baseline and typically receives either no intervention or the standard care to which the AAT intervention is being compared."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of qualitative research in AAT?",
            "options": ["Focus on numerical data and statistical analysis.", "Emphasis on understanding experiences, perspectives, and meanings.", "Use of large sample sizes to ensure generalizability.", "Control of variables to establish cause-and-effect relationships."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Qualitative research explores the 'why' behind phenomena, focusing on in-depth understanding of experiences and perspectives rather than numerical measurement."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A study reports a p-value of 0.06. Using a significance level of 0.05, this result would be considered:",
            "options": ["Statistically significant.", "Clinically significant.", "Not statistically significant.", "Impossible to interpret without more information."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A p-value greater than 0.05 indicates that the results are not statistically significant at the chosen significance level, meaning the observed effect could be due to chance."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a potential source of bias in AAT research?",
            "options": ["Random assignment of participants to groups.", "Use of standardized outcome measures.", "Researcher allegiance to a particular intervention.", "Blinding of participants to the treatment condition."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Researcher allegiance, where the researcher's beliefs or expectations influence the study's results, is a significant source of bias."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "In the context of critical appraisal, what does 'internal validity' refer to?",
            "options": ["The extent to which the results of a study can be generalized to other populations or settings.", "The accuracy and consistency of the measurement tools used in the study.", "The degree to which the study design and conduct minimize bias and ensure that the observed effects are due to the intervention.", "The ethical considerations taken into account during the study."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal validity refers to the rigor of the study design and conduct in minimizing bias, ensuring that the observed effects are attributable to the intervention."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "Client Sarah, a 10-year-old with autism, participates in AAT sessions. Based on single-case research designs, how would you monitor Sarah's progress and the effectiveness of the intervention?",
            "options": ["Rely solely on subjective reports from Sarah's parents.", "Administer standardized assessments at the beginning and end of the intervention only.", "Continuously collect data on Sarah's target behaviors throughout the intervention and compare them to baseline data.", "Compare Sarah's progress to that of other children with autism receiving different interventions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Single-case designs emphasize continuous data collection and comparison to baseline to assess individual responses to interventions. This contrasts with group designs that analyze average effects."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "What is the 'file drawer problem' in the context of meta-analyses?",
            "options": ["The difficulty in accessing research articles stored in physical archives.", "The tendency for studies with statistically significant results to be published more often than studies with null results.", "The challenge of organizing and managing large datasets.", "The lack of funding for AAT research."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The file drawer problem refers to the bias created when studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published, leading to an overestimation of effect sizes in meta-analyses."

        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "You are designing an AAT program for veterans with PTSD. How can you BEST incorporate evidence-based practice into your program design?",
            "options": ["Rely solely on anecdotal evidence and personal experiences.", "Ignore existing research and create a completely novel approach.", "Consult with other AAT practitioners and adopt their practices without critical evaluation.", "Review relevant research literature, identify effective interventions, and adapt them to the specific needs of the veterans in your program."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice involves integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values to inform decision-making."
