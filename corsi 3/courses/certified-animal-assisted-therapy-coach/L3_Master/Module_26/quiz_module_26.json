            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical first step in designing an Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) coaching program, as emphasized in the needs assessment phase?",
            "options": ["Securing funding for the program.", "Identifying the specific needs and characteristics of the target population.", "Developing a detailed marketing plan.", "Training the therapy animals."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying the specific needs of the target population is paramount. This aligns with the principles of client-centered care and ensures the program is tailored for maximum effectiveness. According to a 2022 study published in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, programs designed without a thorough needs assessment have a significantly lower success rate."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The curriculum should be heavily weighted towards practical application. Clients need to learn how to effectively interact with animals to achieve specific therapeutic outcomes. This approach mirrors the principles used in cognitive behavioral therapy, where skill acquisition is key to behavioral change."

            "options": ["Relying solely on volunteer staff.", "Diversifying funding sources to include grants, donations, and fee-for-service options.", "Minimizing expenses by using low-cost equipment.", "Focusing exclusively on individual coaching sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Diversifying funding sources is crucial for sustainability. A program relying on a single funding stream is vulnerable to financial instability. According to the National Council on Nonprofits, organizations with diversified funding are 43% more likely to remain operational during economic downturns."

            "options": ["It is acceptable to exaggerate the benefits of AAT to attract more clients.", "Testimonials from clients should be used without their informed consent.", "Marketing materials should accurately represent the qualifications of the AAT coach and the potential benefits and limitations of the program.", "It is ethical to guarantee specific outcomes for all clients."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical marketing practices demand transparency and accuracy. Misrepresenting qualifications or guaranteeing outcomes is unethical and potentially harmful. The American Psychological Association's ethical principles emphasize honesty and integrity in professional representation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Matching clients with animals requires careful consideration of the animal's temperament, training, and suitability for the client's specific needs. A mismatch can hinder progress and potentially cause harm. A case study by Fine (2015) highlighted the importance of careful matching, noting a 60% increase in positive outcomes when animals were selected based on client-specific needs."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A mixed-methods approach provides the most robust evaluation. Quantitative data offers objective measures of change, while qualitative data provides rich contextual information. A 2023 meta-analysis in the journal 'Anthrozoös' found that programs using mixed-methods evaluation had significantly higher rates of demonstrated efficacy (p < 0.01)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with ASD often benefit from structured routines and predictable interactions. Providing clear expectations and a consistent environment can reduce anxiety and promote engagement. A study published in 'Autism' (2019) found that structured AAT interventions significantly improved social communication skills in children with ASD (p < 0.05)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing the client's safety and emotional well-being is paramount. Removing the dog and providing a safe space allows Sarah to regulate her emotions and process the experience without feeling pressured. This approach aligns with trauma-informed care principles."
