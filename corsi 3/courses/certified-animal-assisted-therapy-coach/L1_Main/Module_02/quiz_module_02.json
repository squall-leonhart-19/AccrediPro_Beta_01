        {
            "id": "q2_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical ethical consideration during the AAT assessment process?",
            "options": ["Obtaining informed consent from the client and/or their legal guardian.", "Ensuring the animal enjoys the interaction.", "Minimizing the assessment time to reduce client fatigue.", "Using the assessment data for marketing purposes."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is paramount, ensuring clients understand the process, potential risks, and benefits, and agree to participate. This aligns with ethical guidelines emphasizing autonomy and respect for persons."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "A client presents with anxiety and a desire to improve social interaction skills. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial goal for AAT coaching?",
            "options": ["Training the client to independently handle the therapy animal.", "Reducing anxiety symptoms and increasing comfort in social settings.", "Achieving a specific score on a standardized anxiety assessment.", "Eliminating all anxiety triggers."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The initial goal should directly address the client's presenting symptoms and desired outcomes, focusing on reducing anxiety and improving social comfort, not on animal handling or assessment scores."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "Which of the following behaviors would be MOST concerning during an animal suitability assessment for AAT?",
            "options": ["Occasional barking at unfamiliar sounds.", "Consistent avoidance of human contact and signs of fear or aggression.", "Mild interest in chasing small animals.", "Sleeping for extended periods during the assessment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Consistent avoidance, fear, or aggression indicates the animal may not be suitable for AAT due to potential safety risks and welfare concerns. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), animals should exhibit stable temperaments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A client is highly sensitive to allergens. Which type of animal would be LEAST compatible, requiring significant modification or alternative approaches?",
            "options": ["A hypoallergenic dog breed.", "A short-haired cat.", "A reptile.", "A fish."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cats are known to produce more allergens than some other animals, making them potentially less compatible for clients with allergies, even short-haired breeds. Reptiles and fish are generally considered hypoallergenic."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "While observing a client interacting with a therapy dog, you notice the client consistently avoids eye contact and maintains a closed body posture. What might this indicate?",
            "options": ["The client is highly engaged with the animal.", "The client may be experiencing discomfort or anxiety.", "The client is demonstrating appropriate boundaries with the animal.", "The client is simply tired."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Avoidance of eye contact and a closed body posture are often nonverbal indicators of discomfort, anxiety, or a lack of connection. Observational techniques help identify these subtle cues."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "Which standardized assessment tool is MOST appropriate for measuring a child's emotional and behavioral functioning?",
            "options": ["The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).", "The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).", "The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).", "The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is specifically designed to assess emotional and behavioral problems in children, whereas the other options are designed for different populations or purposes."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "After analyzing assessment data, you identify a pattern of social withdrawal and low self-esteem in a client. What is the MOST appropriate initial interpretation?",
            "options": ["The client is intentionally avoiding social interaction.", "These patterns suggest potential areas for intervention and goal setting in AAT coaching.", "The client is likely to be diagnosed with a severe mental illness.", "The client's behavior is solely due to environmental factors."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying patterns helps to inform appropriate interventions and goal setting. While the patterns are important, they do not equate to a diagnosis or definitive cause."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A client's assessment reveals a strong fear of dogs, but they express a desire to overcome this fear through AAT. What is the MOST appropriate initial step in developing their AAT coaching plan?",
            "options": ["Immediately introducing the client to a large, friendly dog.", "Gradually exposing the client to dogs in a controlled and safe environment, starting with pictures or videos.", "Recommending the client abandon AAT and seek alternative therapies.", "Ignoring the fear and focusing on other goals."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gradual exposure is a key principle in addressing phobias. Starting with less intense stimuli (pictures, videos) and gradually increasing exposure helps the client build tolerance and reduce fear in a controlled manner."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a 45-year-old client with PTSD showed a <span class=\"stat-highlight\">30%</span> reduction in anxiety symptoms after 8 weeks of AAT. Which assessment tool was MOST likely used to quantify this reduction?",
            "options": ["A subjective client self-report scale measuring anxiety.", "Observational notes from the AAT coach.", "A standardized animal behavior assessment.", "A physical examination by a physician."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Quantifying a reduction in anxiety symptoms typically involves a standardized or validated self-report scale specifically designed to measure anxiety levels. Observational notes are qualitative, and animal behavior assessments or physical exams are not directly related to client anxiety."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST important when documenting assessment results and developing an AAT coaching plan?",
            "options": ["Maintaining client confidentiality and privacy.", "Using objective and measurable language whenever possible.", "Including personal opinions and biases about the client's abilities.", "Clearly outlining goals, objectives, and planned interventions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personal opinions and biases should never be included in professional documentation. Objectivity, confidentiality, and clear planning are crucial for ethical and effective AAT coaching."
