            "question": "In advanced communication techniques, what is the PRIMARY benefit of using 'paradoxical intention' with a client struggling with anxiety around their animal?",
            "options": ["To increase anxiety levels for desensitization.", "To help the client avoid the anxiety-provoking situation.", "To encourage the client to intentionally engage with their anxiety.", "To distract the client from their anxiety."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Paradoxical intention, as explored in L3, helps clients confront their anxiety by intentionally engaging with it, which can reduce its power and lead to a sense of control. This approach contrasts with avoidance strategies that often reinforce anxiety."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical guidelines, as covered in L5, prioritize client welfare and professional integrity.

            "explanation": "Prioritizing rapport, safety, and client agency is crucial when working with trauma survivors.
