            "id": "q22_1",
            "question": "According to the lesson on ethical boundaries, what is the PRIMARY purpose of establishing clear boundaries in spiritual direction?",
            "options": ["To create a rigid and inflexible structure for the relationship.", "To protect both the spiritual director and the directee from potential harm or exploitation.", "To minimize the emotional connection between the director and directee.", "To ensure the spiritual director maintains complete control over the direction of the sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing clear boundaries protects both parties involved, preventing harm and exploitation, and fostering a safe environment for spiritual growth. This aligns with ethical guidelines emphasizing beneficence and non-maleficence."
        },
        {
            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A directee discloses that they are experiencing suicidal ideation but insists that the director not share this information. Ethically, what is the MOST appropriate course of action for the spiritual director?",
            "options": ["Respect the directee's confidentiality and continue the session as planned.", "Gently explore the directee's feelings and the immediacy of the risk, and if the risk is imminent, break confidentiality to ensure their safety.", "Immediately terminate the spiritual direction relationship.", "Inform the directee that their spiritual progress will be hindered if they do not disclose this information to a mental health professional."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While confidentiality is paramount, it is not absolute. When a directee presents a clear and imminent danger to themselves, ethical guidelines permit breaking confidentiality to ensure their safety. This aligns with the principle of beneficence."

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the concept of 'dual relationships' in the context of spiritual direction?",
            "options": ["Having two spiritual directors simultaneously.", "Engaging in a separate, potentially conflicting relationship with a directee outside of the spiritual direction context.", "Referring a directee to another spiritual director.", "Having two directees who are related to each other."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships occur when the spiritual director has another type of relationship with the directee (e.g., friend, family member, business partner). These relationships can compromise objectivity and potentially exploit the power imbalance inherent in the director-directee relationship."

            "id": "q22_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on competence, what is the spiritual director's ethical responsibility regarding their own limitations?",
            "options": ["To accept all directees regardless of their needs.", "To only work with directees whose issues align with their expertise and to refer out when necessary.", "To attempt to address all issues, even if outside their area of competence, to avoid disappointing the directee.", "To consult with other professionals without informing the directee."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires spiritual directors to recognize their limitations and refer directees to other qualified professionals when the directee's needs fall outside their scope of competence. This protects the directee from potential harm and ensures they receive appropriate care."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Rational Model uses a structured, logical process for ethical decision-making, involving problem identification, application of ethical principles, consideration of consequences, and selection of the best course of action. This model provides a framework for addressing complex ethical dilemmas."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Referring Sarah to a specialist demonstrates ethical competence and ensures she receives the appropriate level of care for her specific needs. The other options could potentially cause further harm or violate professional boundaries."

            "explanation": "Ethical integration of spiritual practices requires respecting the directee's autonomy and ensuring the practices are congruent with their beliefs and values. Imposing practices or using them without proper training can be harmful and unethical."
