            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of how a pendulum is believed to function in energy field assessment?",
            "options": ["It is powered by subtle electromagnetic fields.", "It amplifies unconscious ideomotor responses.", "It directly communicates with spirit guides.", "It randomly selects answers to provide guidance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The pendulum's movement is thought to be amplified ideomotor responses, subtle muscle movements influenced by the subconscious mind. While some practitioners may incorporate spiritual elements, the core mechanism is rooted in the body's unconscious responses."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Trauma-informed care prioritizes safety and empowerment.

A case study published in 'Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine' in 2022 demonstrated its effectiveness in pain management."

It is important to stay grounded and present, offering reassurance and support while respecting the client's process. If the emotional intensity becomes overwhelming or beyond your scope of practice, referral to a mental health professional is warranted."
