            "question": "Which of the following is a primary benefit of conducting a thorough energy field assessment?",
            "options": ["To diagnose medical conditions.", "To predict future events in a client's life.", "To identify imbalances and energetic blockages affecting well-being.", "To replace conventional medical treatments."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Energy field assessments help identify imbalances, allowing for targeted interventions to promote well-being. They are not a replacement for medical diagnosis or treatment."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "During visual observation of the aura, a client's aura appears consistently grey and muddy. According to the lesson, what might this indicate?",
            "options": ["Excellent health and vitality.", "High levels of spiritual development.", "Potential energetic depletion or unresolved emotional issues.", "Strong connection to nature."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A grey or muddy aura often suggests energetic depletion, emotional stagnation, or unresolved issues that are impacting the client's energy field."

            "question": "When using a pendulum for energy assessment, what does a circular clockwise motion typically indicate?",
            "options": ["A negative or blocked energy flow.", "A neutral energy state.", "A positive or open energy flow.", "A disconnection from the earth's energy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In dowsing and pendulum techniques, a clockwise motion usually signifies a positive, balanced, or open energy flow, while a counter-clockwise motion often indicates a blockage or negativity."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "In muscle testing, a 'strong' muscle response generally indicates:",
            "options": ["The client is dehydrated.", "Agreement or affirmation with the statement or substance being tested.", "Disagreement or rejection of the statement or substance being tested.", "The client has strong physical strength."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A strong muscle response in muscle testing typically indicates that the body is in agreement or alignment with the statement or substance being tested. A weak response indicates the opposite."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which sense is MOST relied upon during intuitive scanning for energy sensitivity?",
            "options": ["Sight.", "Smell.", "Touch.", "All senses are equally important."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While touch is commonly associated with intuitive scanning, skilled practitioners integrate all their senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch) along with intuition to gather comprehensive information about the energy field."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A client reports feeling lethargic and unmotivated. During chakra assessment, you find their root chakra feels weak and depleted. Which of the following affirmations would be MOST appropriate to suggest to the client?",
            "options": ["'I am loved and supported by the universe.'", "'I am creative and express myself freely.'", "'I am safe, secure, and grounded.'", "'I am worthy of love and compassion.'"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The root chakra is associated with feeling grounded, safe, and secure. An affirmation targeting these feelings is most appropriate for addressing an imbalance in this chakra."

            "question": "According to traditional Chinese medicine, stagnation of energy flow in the Liver meridian can manifest as which of the following symptoms?",
            "options": ["Chronic fatigue and digestive issues.", "Irritability, frustration, and anger.", "Lower back pain and frequent urination.", "Chest pain and shortness of breath."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Stagnation in the Liver meridian is often associated with emotional imbalances such as irritability, frustration, and anger due to the Liver's role in regulating the smooth flow of Qi (energy)."

            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with chronic anxiety and digestive issues. Aura observation reveals a fragmented solar plexus, pendulum dowsing shows blockage in the stomach meridian, and muscle testing indicates a suppressed emotional response to past trauma. Which of these assessment findings is MOST important to address FIRST?",
            "options": ["The fragmented solar plexus.", "The blockage in the stomach meridian.", "The suppressed emotional response to past trauma.", "All findings should be addressed simultaneously."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While all findings are important, addressing the suppressed emotional response to past trauma is often the most crucial first step. Unresolved trauma can significantly impact the energy field and contribute to imbalances in the chakras and meridians."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a typical component of a comprehensive client profile following an energy field assessment?",
            "options": ["Demographic information (age, occupation).", "Detailed medical history and current medications.", "Summary of energy field assessment findings.", "A list of the client's favorite foods."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While dietary preferences can be helpful, a typical client profile following an energy field assessment focuses on demographic information, medical history, current medications, and a summary of the energy field assessment findings. It does not necessarily include a list of the client's favorite foods."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A meta-analysis of studies using biofield therapies for pain management showed that incorporating multiple assessment methods (aura reading, muscle testing, intuitive scanning) increased the accuracy of identifying the root cause of the pain by approximately:",
            "options": ["15%", "30%", "45%", "60%"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis indicated that combining multiple assessment methods increased the accuracy of identifying the root cause of pain by approximately 30%, leading to more effective treatment strategies. This statistic is fictional but reflects the value of integrated assessment."
