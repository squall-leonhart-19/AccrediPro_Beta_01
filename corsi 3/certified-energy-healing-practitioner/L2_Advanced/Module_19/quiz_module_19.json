        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key scientific principle often cited to support the potential mechanisms of energy healing?",
            "options": ["Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation", "Quantum entanglement", "Mendelian genetics", "Classical conditioning"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Quantum entanglement suggests non-local connections that could potentially underlie certain aspects of energy healing, although further research is needed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of Reiki for pain management included 35 randomized controlled trials. What is the primary conclusion one can draw if the meta-analysis found a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to the control group?",
            "options": ["Reiki definitively cures pain.", "Reiki is likely more effective than placebo for pain management.", "Reiki's effectiveness is solely due to the placebo effect.", "Further research is unnecessary."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A statistically significant result in a meta-analysis suggests that Reiki is likely more effective than a placebo, but it does not definitively prove it cures pain."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "According to research, which brainwave state is most frequently associated with deep relaxation and meditative practices often employed during energy healing modalities?",
            "options": ["Beta waves", "Alpha waves", "Delta waves", "Gamma waves"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are dominant during relaxed states and are often observed during meditation and energy healing practices."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In the context of chakra balancing, what is the primary limitation of research studies that rely solely on subjective self-report measures?",
            "options": ["Self-report measures are always accurate.", "Subjective experiences are irrelevant.", "Self-report measures are prone to bias.", "Subjective experiences can't be quantified."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Self-report measures can be influenced by biases, expectations, and individual interpretations, which can affect the validity of the findings."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "What ethical consideration is MOST important when conducting research on energy healing modalities?",
            "options": ["Ensuring large sample sizes", "Obtaining informed consent from participants", "Publishing only positive results", "Using complex statistical analyses"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is crucial to ensure participants understand the nature of the research, potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw at any time."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, reports feeling less stressed after a series of sound healing sessions. Using the A.U.R.A. framework, which aspect focuses on the client's subjective description of her experience?",
            "options": ["Assessment", "Understanding", "Results", "Application"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The 'Assessment' component involves gathering information about the client's experience, including their subjective reports of stress levels."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which study design is generally considered the 'gold standard' for evaluating the efficacy of an energy healing intervention?",
            "options": ["Case study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Observational study", "Qualitative interview"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs minimize bias and allow for stronger causal inferences compared to other study designs."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a control group in a research study evaluating the effectiveness of Reiki?",
            "options": ["To receive the Reiki intervention", "To provide a baseline for comparison", "To ensure participants are unaware of the treatment", "To increase the sample size"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The control group serves as a baseline to compare the outcomes of the intervention group against, helping determine if the intervention had a genuine effect."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a practitioner reports significant improvement in a client's anxiety symptoms after chakra balancing. What is the MOST important limitation to acknowledge when interpreting these results?",
            "options": ["Case studies provide definitive proof of effectiveness.", "The improvement could be due to chance or other factors.", "Chakra balancing is always effective for anxiety.", "The practitioner is likely biased."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case studies can be influenced by many factors and do not establish cause-and-effect relationships. Improvements could be due to placebo, natural remission, or other interventions."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "A researcher aims to study the impact of sound healing on sleep quality. They use an objective measure (sleep tracker data) and a subjective measure (sleep diary). Which of the following is the MOST likely reason for using both types of measures?",
            "options": ["To save time and money.", "To increase the sample size.", "To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the intervention's effects.", "To confuse the participants."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Combining objective and subjective measures can provide a more complete picture of the intervention's effects, as objective data provides quantifiable information, while subjective data captures the participant's experience."
