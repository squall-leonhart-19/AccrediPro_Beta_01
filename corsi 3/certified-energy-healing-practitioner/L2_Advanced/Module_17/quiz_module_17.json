            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports a significant increase in pain levels after an energy healing session. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Immediately stop all energy work and refer them to a medical doctor.", "Reassure them that this is a normal part of the healing process and continue the session.", "Acknowledge their experience, validate their feelings, and explore potential contributing factors.", "Suggest they take a painkiller and see if it subsides before continuing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Validating the client's experience and exploring potential factors aligns with trauma-informed care and allows for a collaborative approach to managing their pain response. A 2021 study in the 'Journal of Pain' highlighted the importance of patient-centered communication in chronic pain management."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "When working with a client experiencing grief and loss, which energetic technique should be AVOIDED in the initial session?",
            "options": ["Gentle grounding techniques to promote stability.", "Opening the heart chakra to facilitate emotional release.", "Severing energetic cords with the deceased to promote detachment.", "Using visualization to connect with positive memories."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prematurely severing energetic cords can be detrimental during the initial stages of grief, as it may disrupt the client's natural grieving process and sense of connection. Cord-cutting should only be considered after careful assessment and with the client's explicit consent. A 2018 study in 'Death Studies' emphasizes the importance of honoring the attachment bonds during bereavement."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client undergoing treatment for addiction expresses a desire to use energy healing to 'get rid of' their cravings. What is the MOST ethical and effective approach?",
            "options": ["Agree to focus solely on eliminating cravings during the session.", "Explain that energy healing can support their recovery but is not a substitute for medical or psychological treatment.", "Offer to perform a powerful clearing ritual to instantly remove the energetic root of the addiction.", "Suggest they reduce their medication dosage as their energy improves."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It is crucial to emphasize that energy healing is a complementary modality and not a replacement for conventional addiction treatment. Setting realistic expectations and collaborating with the client's healthcare team is essential. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) emphasizes the importance of comprehensive treatment approaches."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY indicator that a client might be experiencing a spiritual emergency rather than a mental health crisis?",
            "options": ["Sudden onset of intense anxiety and panic attacks.", "Experiences of expanded awareness, visions, or altered states of consciousness that are personally meaningful.", "Difficulty functioning in daily life and maintaining relationships.", "Thoughts of self-harm or harming others."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spiritual emergencies often involve experiences of expanded awareness and a sense of meaning or purpose, even if they are challenging. Mental health crises, on the other hand, typically involve significant functional impairment and distress. However, differentiating between the two requires careful assessment and consultation with mental health professionals. Grof, S. (2000). 'Psychology of the Future.'"

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "In end-of-life care, what is the PRIMARY goal of energy healing?",
            "options": ["To prolong life and prevent death.", "To cure the underlying illness.", "To alleviate suffering, promote comfort, and facilitate a peaceful transition.", "To convince the client to accept their fate."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of energy healing in end-of-life care is to enhance the client's quality of life by reducing pain, anxiety, and emotional distress. It aims to support a peaceful and dignified death. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care as improving the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with life-threatening illness."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client discloses a history of severe childhood trauma during an energy healing session. Which of the following actions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Immediately begin working on their root chakra to release the trauma.", "Continue with the session as planned, but avoid asking further questions about the trauma.", "Acknowledge their disclosure, express empathy, and ensure they feel safe and in control. Offer to refer them to a qualified trauma therapist.", "Encourage them to share all the details of their trauma to facilitate healing."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prioritizing safety, control, and referral to a trauma therapist is crucial when working with clients who have experienced trauma. Directly addressing the trauma without proper preparation and support can be re-traumatizing. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides guidelines for trauma-informed care."

            "options": ["Immediately stop the session and call emergency services.", "Attempt to distract them with a positive affirmation.", "Guide them through a grounding exercise and encourage slow, deep breathing.", "Tell them to suppress their emotions and focus on the energy work."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Grounding exercises and deep breathing techniques can help regulate the client's nervous system and promote a sense of safety and stability. This approach is consistent with trauma-informed principles. van der Kolk, B. A. (2014). 'The Body Keeps the Score.'"

            "id": "q17_8",
            "question": "You suspect a client may be experiencing energetic attachments that are negatively impacting their well-being. What is the MOST important consideration before attempting to address these attachments?",
            "options": ["Ensuring you have the necessary training and experience to safely work with energetic attachments.", "Determining the exact nature and source of the attachments.", "Obtaining the client's informed consent to address the attachments.", "All of the above."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Addressing energetic attachments requires specialized training, a thorough assessment, and the client's explicit consent. It is crucial to proceed ethically and responsibly. Pert, C. B. (1997). 'Molecules of Emotion.'"

            "question": "Client Sarah, 62, is receiving palliative care for terminal cancer. She's agreed to energy work to alleviate anxiety. Halfway through, Sarah reports seeing a bright light and feeling pulled 'home.' She appears calm but non-responsive. What's the BEST course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately call her family; she's likely dying.", "Continue the session as she seems peaceful.", "Gently call her name, and if no response within 30 seconds, alert medical staff.", "Begin a strong grounding technique to bring her back."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While Sarah's experience could be a sign of transition, it's essential to first gently assess her responsiveness. Alerting medical staff is appropriate if she doesn't respond, given her palliative care status. It's a balance of respecting her experience and ensuring her safety. Callanan, M., & Kelley, P. (2000). 'Final Gifts.'"

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Confidentiality and client autonomy are paramount in ethical practice.
