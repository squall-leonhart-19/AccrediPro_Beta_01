            "question": "Which advanced energetic assessment technique focuses on identifying the vibrational frequency of organs and systems?",
            "options": ["Chakra scanning", "Applied Kinesiology", "Biofield imaging", "Meridian tapping"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Biofield imaging techniques, such as GDV (Gas Discharge Visualization), provide a visual representation of the energy field, allowing practitioners to assess the vibrational frequency of specific organs and systems. This relates to the case study of Elena, where imbalances were identified using GDV before physical symptoms manifested."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sacred Geometry Healing leverages the inherent energetic properties of geometric shapes and symbols to facilitate healing. These patterns are believed to resonate with the body's energy field, promoting balance and harmony. This was demonstrated in the lesson with the example of using the Flower of Life symbol to amplify healing energy."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The core principle of energetic reprogramming is to identify and replace limiting beliefs that hinder well-being with positive, empowering beliefs. This process helps to shift the energetic blueprint and create lasting change. As stated in the lesson, studies show that belief restructuring can improve mental and emotional health outcomes by up to 40%."
