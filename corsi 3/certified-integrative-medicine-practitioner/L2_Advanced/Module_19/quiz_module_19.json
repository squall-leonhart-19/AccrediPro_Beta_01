            "question": "A randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of acupuncture for chronic lower back pain includes a sham acupuncture group. What is the PRIMARY purpose of including this sham group?",
            "options": ["To increase the sample size of the study.", "To blind participants to the treatment they are receiving.", "To reduce the cost of the intervention.", "To provide an active control group."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sham acupuncture helps to blind participants, minimizing the placebo effect and allowing for a more accurate assessment of the true effects of acupuncture."

            "question": "A meta-analysis reports a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.65 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.50-0.85 for the effect of a herbal supplement on reducing anxiety symptoms. What does this suggest?",
            "options": ["The herbal supplement significantly increases anxiety symptoms.", "The herbal supplement significantly reduces anxiety symptoms.", "The herbal supplement has no effect on anxiety symptoms.", "The study is flawed and the results are unreliable."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An odds ratio below 1 suggests a protective effect (reduction in anxiety symptoms), and the confidence interval not crossing 1 indicates statistical significance."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental ethical principle, particularly important in integrative medicine where treatments may be less conventional and participants need to be fully aware of potential risks and benefits."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of interventions, providing the strongest evidence due to their ability to control for bias and confounding variables."

While this is encouraging, what is the MAIN limitation of relying solely on this case study to recommend this diet to other patients?",
            "options": ["Case studies are too expensive to conduct.", "Case studies lack generalizability to other populations.", "Case studies are not peer-reviewed.", "Case studies require large sample sizes."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case studies describe individual experiences and may not be representative of the broader population, limiting their generalizability."

            "options": ["Immediately prescribe the herbal formula at the highest recommended dose.", "Disregard the research findings due to the small sample size and methodological flaws.", "Use the herbal formula as a first-line treatment, while closely monitoring the patient for adverse effects.", "Acknowledge the limitations of the study and consider using the herbal formula in conjunction with other evidence-based strategies, while carefully monitoring the patient."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Given the limited evidence, a cautious approach is warranted. Integrating the herbal formula with other evidence-based strategies and close monitoring allows for a balanced and responsible approach to patient care."
