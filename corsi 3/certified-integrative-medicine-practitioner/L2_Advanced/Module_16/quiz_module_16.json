            "question": "In a case study involving a 45-year-old female with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and chronic fatigue, which of the following dietary interventions is MOST likely to reduce inflammation and improve thyroid function, according to current research?",
            "options": ["Strict ketogenic diet with high saturated fat intake", "Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet focusing on elimination and reintroduction", "High-carbohydrate, low-fat vegan diet", "Randomized, unrestricted diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet has shown promise in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in individuals with autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's by eliminating potential trigger foods and gradually reintroducing them to identify sensitivities."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A 38-year-old male presents with chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and muscle pain. Mold testing reveals elevated levels of mycotoxins. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step in addressing mold toxicity?",
            "options": ["Administering high-dose antifungal medication", "Recommending a binder such as cholestyramine or activated charcoal, along with environmental remediation", "Initiating a heavy metal chelation protocol", "Prescribing antidepressants to manage symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary approach to mold toxicity involves removing the source of exposure and using binders to facilitate the elimination of mycotoxins from the body. Environmental remediation is crucial to prevent re-exposure."

            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "A patient with SIBO and anxiety reports increased anxiety levels after starting a high-FODMAP diet aimed at improving gut health. What is the MOST likely explanation for this paradoxical reaction?",
            "options": ["The FODMAPs are directly neurotoxic.", "The FODMAPs are feeding the SIBO, leading to increased gas production and vagal nerve stimulation, exacerbating anxiety.", "The patient is experiencing a placebo effect.", "The patient is allergic to FODMAPs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In SIBO, increased FODMAP intake can lead to bacterial fermentation, producing gas and metabolites that can irritate the gut lining and stimulate the vagal nerve, potentially exacerbating anxiety symptoms through the gut-brain axis."

            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A 28-year-old female with PCOS and insulin resistance is prescribed metformin but experiences significant gastrointestinal side effects. Which of the following natural interventions has demonstrated efficacy in improving insulin sensitivity and hormonal balance in PCOS as an alternative or adjunct to metformin?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin C supplementation", "Inositol supplementation, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol", "Intermittent fasting with a focus on prolonged fasting periods", "A diet high in processed foods and refined sugars"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Inositol, particularly myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, has been shown in studies to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce androgen levels, and improve ovulation in women with PCOS, often with fewer side effects than metformin."

            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In a patient presenting with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline, which of the following biomarkers is MOST indicative of ongoing inflammatory processes in the brain?",
            "options": ["Serum cholesterol levels", "Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6 in cerebrospinal fluid", "Blood glucose levels", "White blood cell count"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, in cerebrospinal fluid directly indicate inflammatory processes within the central nervous system, suggesting neuroinflammation."

            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A 50-year-old male presents with neurological symptoms including tremors, memory loss, and peripheral neuropathy. A hair analysis reveals elevated levels of mercury. Which chelating agent is MOST commonly used and researched for mercury detoxification, although it should be used with caution and under medical supervision?",
            "options": ["EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)", "DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid)", "Vitamin C", "Activated Charcoal"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "DMSA is a commonly used and researched chelating agent for mercury detoxification. However, chelation therapy should always be administered under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional due to potential risks and side effects."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While many symptoms overlap between Lyme disease and Bartonella, stretch marks (striae) and certain neurological symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, are more commonly associated with Bartonella co-infection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, playing a vital role in ATP production. Supplementation is often used to support mitochondrial function and improve energy levels in CFS patients."

            "question": "A patient presents with symptoms of heavy metal toxicity and Lyme disease. When creating a treatment plan using the HEALS framework, what is the MOST important initial consideration?",
            "options": ["Immediately starting aggressive chelation therapy.", "Focusing solely on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease.", "Prioritizing lifestyle and environmental factors to reduce overall toxic load and support detoxification pathways before aggressive interventions.", "Ignoring the heavy metal toxicity and focusing only on Lyme disease treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Using the HEALS framework, it's crucial to address the 'Lifestyle' and 'Environmental' factors first, reducing overall toxic load and supporting the body's natural detoxification pathways. This prepares the body for more targeted interventions like chelation or antibiotic therapy, improving their effectiveness and reducing potential adverse reactions."
