            "question": "A 62-year-old client presents with polypharmacy, including a statin, an ACE inhibitor, and an antidepressant. Which initial integrative strategy is MOST crucial to evaluate?",
            "options": ["Assessing potential drug interactions and nutrient depletions.", "Immediately recommending a full detoxification protocol.", "Prescribing a high-dose multivitamin to counteract potential deficiencies.", "Suggesting discontinuation of one medication per week."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Assessing drug interactions and nutrient depletions is paramount in polypharmacy to avoid adverse effects and optimize medication efficacy. A 2021 study in the *Journal of the American Geriatrics Society* highlighted the significant risk of adverse drug events in older adults taking five or more medications."

            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "Which of the following dietary interventions has shown the MOST promise in managing autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, based on recent meta-analyses?",
            "options": ["A ketogenic diet high in animal fats.", "An elimination diet focusing on identifying and removing trigger foods.", "A high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.", "A diet rich in processed foods and artificial sweeteners."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elimination diets, guided by food sensitivity testing or empirical observation, have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing inflammation and symptom severity in autoimmune diseases. A 2023 meta-analysis in *Nutrients* supports this approach."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) reports significant post-exertional malaise (PEM). Which of the following activity pacing strategies is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encouraging daily vigorous exercise to build stamina.", "Recommending complete bed rest until symptoms subside.", "Advising the client to gradually increase activity levels by 5-10% per week, monitoring for PEM.", "Suggesting high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for improved cardiovascular function."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Graded activity pacing, with careful monitoring for PEM, is crucial in managing CFS. Pushing beyond the energy envelope can exacerbate symptoms. Research in *Fatigue: Biomedicine, Health & Behavior* emphasizes the importance of individualized pacing plans."

            "question": "A client with a history of depression is currently managed with an SSRI but still experiences persistent low mood and fatigue. Which integrative approach is MOST likely to be beneficial as an adjunct to medication?",
            "options": ["St. John's Wort monotherapy.", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and regular physical activity.", "High doses of Vitamin B12 without assessing deficiency.", "Replacing the SSRI with a placebo."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "CBT and regular physical activity are evidence-based adjuncts to medication for mood disorders. A 2019 meta-analysis in *JAMA Psychiatry* showed that combining therapy and exercise with medication significantly improved outcomes."

            "question": "In integrative oncology support, what is the PRIMARY goal of using complementary therapies alongside conventional cancer treatments?",
            "options": ["To cure the cancer without conventional treatment.", "To replace conventional cancer treatments entirely.", "To enhance quality of life, manage side effects, and potentially improve treatment outcomes.", "To guarantee remission in all cases."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Integrative oncology aims to support conventional cancer treatments by improving quality of life, managing side effects, and potentially enhancing treatment effectiveness. It is not a replacement for standard medical care. The Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) guidelines emphasize this approach."

            "options": ["Prescribing a broad-spectrum antibiotic.", "Recommending a probiotic supplement and mindfulness practices.", "Suggesting a diet high in processed sugars.", "Ignoring the anxiety component and focusing solely on gut symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Probiotics can modulate gut microbiota, influencing brain function, while mindfulness practices can reduce stress and anxiety, impacting gut motility and sensitivity. The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system. A study in *Gastroenterology* showed the efficacy of this combined approach."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A thorough environmental and occupational history is crucial to identify potential sources of toxin exposure. This information guides targeted testing and intervention strategies. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) emphasizes the importance of exposure assessment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing for interactions and evaluating thyroid function are critical. Detox teas can contain ingredients that interfere with thyroid hormone absorption or metabolism. *Thyroid* journal often publishes articles on drug-nutrient interactions affecting thyroid function."
