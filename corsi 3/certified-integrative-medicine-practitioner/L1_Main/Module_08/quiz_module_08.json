            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "During a holistic history taking, which question would be MOST relevant in uncovering potential contributing factors to a patient's cancer diagnosis?",
            "options": ["What is your favorite color?", "Have you ever broken a bone?", "What is your typical daily stress level and how do you manage it?", "Do you prefer coffee or tea?"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing a patient's stress levels and coping mechanisms is crucial in holistic history taking, as chronic stress can significantly impact immune function and overall health, potentially contributing to cancer development or progression."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Acupuncture has been shown in multiple clinical trials to be effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). A 2018 meta-analysis published in Supportive Care in Cancer found significant benefits of acupuncture for CINV management."

            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Which biomarker is commonly used to assess systemic inflammation, a factor that can contribute to cancer progression?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D levels", "C-reactive protein (CRP)", "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)", "Blood glucose"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a widely used biomarker to assess systemic inflammation. Elevated CRP levels have been associated with increased risk of cancer development and poorer outcomes in cancer patients."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "In the context of personalized nutrition for cancer prevention and support, what is the primary rationale for recommending organic foods?",
            "options": ["Organic foods are cheaper.", "Organic foods are more visually appealing.", "To minimize exposure to pesticides and herbicides, which may have carcinogenic effects.", "Organic foods always contain more nutrients."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recommending organic foods aims to minimize exposure to potentially carcinogenic pesticides and herbicides, which are commonly used in conventional agriculture. While not always the case, organic farming practices often prioritize soil health and nutrient density as well."

            "options": ["Echinacea", "Curcumin", "Ginseng", "St. John's Wort"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, has been extensively studied for its anti-cancer properties. Research suggests it can inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death), especially in prostate cancer models."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sauna therapy, while beneficial in some contexts, is generally not recommended during active cancer treatment as it can increase the metabolic burden on the liver and kidneys, potentially interfering with chemotherapy or other treatments. It should be carefully considered and supervised by a qualified healthcare professional."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires the practitioner to thoroughly research the proposed protocol, understand potential interactions with conventional treatments, and engage in open communication with both the patient and their oncologist. Collaboration and informed consent are crucial in integrative oncology."
