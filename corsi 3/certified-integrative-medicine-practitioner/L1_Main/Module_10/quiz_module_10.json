            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique is MOST helpful in identifying hidden food sensitivities beyond traditional allergy testing?",
            "options": ["Skin prick test", "IgE blood test", "ALCAT test (Antigen Leukocyte Cellular Antibody Test)", "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The ALCAT test assesses cellular reactions to various substances, potentially revealing sensitivities missed by standard IgE allergy tests, which primarily detect immediate allergic reactions. A 2018 study in the Journal of Nutritional Medicine highlighted its utility in some individuals with chronic digestive issues."

            "id": "q10_2",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. After initial assessment, you suspect a mitochondrial dysfunction. Which nutrient would be MOST crucial to include in their personalized nutrition plan to support mitochondrial health?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Iron", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "CoQ10 is a vital component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, essential for energy production. Supplementation can improve mitochondrial function and reduce symptoms of fatigue and oxidative stress. A meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition in 2020 supports this."

            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, reports chronic stress and difficulty sleeping. Which mind-body technique, supported by research in reducing cortisol levels, would be MOST effective as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Intense aerobic exercise", "Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR)", "Watching television before bed", "Intermittent Fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progressive Muscle Relaxation has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and improve sleep quality by promoting relaxation and reducing muscle tension. A 2019 study in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology demonstrated its effectiveness in managing stress-related symptoms."

            "id": "q10_4",
            "question": "For a client with osteoarthritis, which type of exercise program is MOST appropriate to improve joint function and reduce pain, while minimizing stress on the joints?",
            "options": ["High-impact plyometrics", "Prolonged endurance running", "Aquatic therapy and range-of-motion exercises", "Heavy weightlifting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Aquatic therapy provides a low-impact environment, reducing stress on joints while allowing for improved range of motion and muscle strengthening. The Arthritis Foundation recommends water-based exercises for individuals with osteoarthritis."

            "id": "q10_5",
            "question": "A client consistently wakes up at 3 AM and struggles to fall back asleep. Based on advanced sleep optimization strategies, what intervention would be MOST appropriate to investigate FIRST?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a sedative medication", "Recommending a daytime nap", "Assessing cortisol levels and circadian rhythm disruption", "Suggesting they drink warm milk before bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Waking up consistently at the same time each night can indicate a cortisol spike or circadian rhythm imbalance. Assessing cortisol levels and addressing any underlying hormonal issues is crucial for restoring normal sleep patterns. A study in Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022) emphasizes the importance of circadian rhythm stabilization."

        {
            "id": "q10_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective strategy for minimizing exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the home environment?",
            "options": ["Using conventional cleaning products", "Heating food in plastic containers", "Using air fresheners with synthetic fragrances", "Switching to organic produce and using glass food storage containers"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Switching to organic produce reduces exposure to pesticides, while using glass food storage containers avoids leaching of chemicals like BPA from plastics into food. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides guidelines on minimizing exposure to EDCs."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MBSR and self-compassion practices help individuals develop emotional regulation skills and cultivate a more compassionate relationship with themselves, fostering resilience in the face of past trauma. Research in the Journal of Traumatic Stress (2021) supports this approach."
