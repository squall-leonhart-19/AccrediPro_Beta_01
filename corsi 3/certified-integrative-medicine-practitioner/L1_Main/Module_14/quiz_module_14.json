            "question": "When interpreting a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which of the following liver enzymes is MOST indicative of biliary obstruction?",
            "options": ["Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)", "Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)", "Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)", "Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is strongly suggestive of biliary obstruction. While GGT can also be elevated, ALP is more specific in this context."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female client presents with fatigue, brain fog, and mild depression. Lab results reveal low T3 levels despite normal TSH and T4. Which supplement combination is MOST likely to support thyroid hormone conversion?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D and Calcium", "Selenium and Zinc", "Iron and Vitamin C", "Magnesium and Potassium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium and Zinc are crucial for the enzyme 5'-deiodinase, which converts T4 to the active T3 hormone. Supplementing with these nutrients can support thyroid hormone conversion."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which dietary approach is MOST effective for managing insulin resistance in a client with PCOS, considering the impact on hormonal balance?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "Low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet", "High-protein, ketogenic diet", "Vegan diet with emphasis on legumes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-carbohydrate, moderate-protein diet helps to stabilize blood sugar levels, reduce insulin resistance, and support hormonal balance in women with PCOS. High-carbohydrate diets can exacerbate insulin resistance."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced stress management techniques primarily focuses on altering negative thought patterns and promoting cognitive restructuring?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation", "Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)", "Biofeedback"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) directly targets negative thought patterns and aims to restructure them into more positive and adaptive ones, thereby reducing stress."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "For a client recovering from a musculoskeletal injury, which type of exercise is MOST effective for promoting tissue healing and restoring range of motion in the initial stages?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Plyometric exercises", "Isometric exercises", "Marathon running"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Isometric exercises involve muscle contraction without joint movement, making them ideal for strengthening muscles and promoting tissue healing without placing excessive stress on the injured area during the initial recovery phase."

            "options": ["Taking a melatonin supplement only when needed", "Exposing oneself to bright light in the evening", "Following a consistent sleep-wake schedule and optimizing light exposure", "Consuming a large meal right before bed"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Following a consistent sleep-wake schedule and optimizing light exposure helps to regulate the body's natural circadian rhythm, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Bright light exposure in the morning is particularly beneficial."
