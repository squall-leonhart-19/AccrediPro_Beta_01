            "question": "Which advanced assessment technique is MOST useful for identifying subtle movement imbalances and fascial restrictions?",
            "options": ["Palpation", "Gait analysis", "Postural assessment using grid analysis", "Applied kinesiology"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Applied kinesiology, when performed by a trained practitioner, can identify subtle muscular imbalances and fascial restrictions that might be missed by standard palpation or visual assessment methods. It leverages the neurological relationship between muscles and organs."

            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A client presents with a known MTHFR C677T homozygous mutation. Based on nutrigenomic principles, which nutrient supplementation strategy is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["High-dose folic acid", "Folinic acid or 5-MTHF", "Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)", "Riboflavin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation may have reduced ability to convert folic acid to its active form, 5-MTHF. Supplementation with folinic acid or 5-MTHF bypasses this impaired conversion, ensuring adequate folate bioavailability."

            "question": "Which of the following herbal combinations is MOST synergistic for supporting liver detoxification pathways?",
            "options": ["Milk thistle, dandelion root, and turmeric", "Echinacea, goldenseal, and astragalus", "St. John's Wort, valerian root, and passionflower", "Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, and gotu kola"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Milk thistle supports liver cell regeneration, dandelion root promotes bile flow, and turmeric provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, creating a synergistic effect for liver detoxification."

            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A client reports chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels. Which mind-body technique would be MOST effective in downregulating the sympathetic nervous system?",
            "options": ["Vigorous aerobic exercise", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "High-intensity interval training", "Competitive sports"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progressive muscle relaxation directly targets the reduction of muscle tension, a key component of the stress response, and promotes parasympathetic nervous system activation, helping to lower cortisol levels."

            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Which environmental toxin is MOST associated with endocrine disruption and potential reproductive health issues?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Bisphenol A (BPA)", "Arsenic", "Mercury"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bisphenol A (BPA), found in many plastics and resins, is a known endocrine disruptor that can mimic estrogen and interfere with hormonal signaling, potentially leading to reproductive health problems."

            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the case study presented on a 45-year-old female with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, what dietary intervention showed the MOST significant improvement in thyroid antibody levels?",
            "options": ["Gluten-free diet", "Dairy-free diet", "Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet", "Low-FODMAP diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The case study demonstrated that the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet, which eliminates common inflammatory foods, resulted in the most significant reduction in thyroid antibody levels, suggesting a strong link between gut health and autoimmune thyroid disease."

            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Elevated levels of urinary mycotoxins, coupled with symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction, MOST strongly suggest exposure to:",
            "options": ["Heavy metals", "Mold", "Pesticides", "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urinary mycotoxins are direct indicators of mold exposure and subsequent colonization or detoxification efforts. Fatigue and cognitive dysfunction are common symptoms associated with mold toxicity."

            "question": "A functional lab test reveals significantly elevated levels of homocysteine. Which nutrient deficiency is MOST likely contributing to this elevation?",
            "options": ["Vitamin A", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin B12", "Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B12, along with folate and vitamin B6, is crucial for the methylation cycle, which converts homocysteine to methionine. Deficiency in these nutrients can lead to elevated homocysteine levels."
