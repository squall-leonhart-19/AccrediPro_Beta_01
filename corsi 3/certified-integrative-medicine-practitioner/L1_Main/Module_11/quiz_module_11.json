            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet, a modified paleo diet, has shown promise in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in autoimmune conditions. A 2021 study in the journal Nutrients showed a significant reduction in inflammatory markers in patients following AIP."
