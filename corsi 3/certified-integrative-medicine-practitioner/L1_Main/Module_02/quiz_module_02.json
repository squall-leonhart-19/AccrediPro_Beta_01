            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring the client's timeline helps to identify patterns and potential triggers that may have contributed to their current health status."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue and digestive issues. Which functional lab test would be MOST appropriate as an initial step to assess gut health?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis with Parasitology", "Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Thyroid Panel"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A Comprehensive Stool Analysis provides detailed information about the gut microbiome, including the presence of dysbiosis, pathogens, and digestive markers."

            "options": ["Producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate", "Breaking down complex carbohydrates and fiber", "Preventing the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria", "Synthesizing vitamin K and certain B vitamins"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bifidobacteria are known for their ability to compete with and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut."

            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "A female client reports fatigue, hair loss, and brittle nails. Which nutrient deficiency is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Iron", "Vitamin B12", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Iron deficiency is a common cause of fatigue, hair loss, and brittle nails, especially in women."

            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "When assessing endocrine function, what is the significance of measuring <span class=\"highlight\">free T3</span> rather than total T3?",
            "options": ["Free T3 is a more accurate measure of thyroid hormone production", "Free T3 represents the active form of thyroid hormone available to tissues", "Free T3 is less susceptible to fluctuations due to binding proteins", "All of the above"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Free T3 is the unbound, active form of the hormone that directly affects cellular function, making it a more relevant marker than total T3."

            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common method for assessing a client's toxic burden related to heavy metals?",
            "options": ["Hair analysis", "Urine challenge test", "Blood test for liver enzymes", "Saliva cortisol test"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A urine challenge test, often using a chelating agent like DMPS or DMSA, can help assess the body's burden of heavy metals by measuring their excretion in urine."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "In the case study of Sarah, a 45-year-old with chronic fatigue, digestive issues, and anxiety, what was the PRIMARY identified root cause based on the synthesized assessment data?",
            "options": ["Thyroid dysfunction", "Chronic Lyme disease", "Gut dysbiosis and adrenal fatigue", "Heavy metal toxicity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In Sarah's case study, the primary root cause was identified as gut dysbiosis, contributing to adrenal fatigue and impacting her overall health."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "A client's functional lab results reveal elevated levels of <span class=\"highlight\">methylmalonic acid (MMA)</span>. This is MOST indicative of a deficiency in which nutrient?",
            "options": ["Folate", "Vitamin B6", "Vitamin B12", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated MMA levels are a sensitive marker of Vitamin B12 deficiency, as B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA."
        },
        {
            "id": "q2_10",
            "question": "When synthesizing assessment data, what is the importance of considering the <span class=\"highlight\">'terrain'</span> of the body, as described in integrative medicine?",
            "options": ["To focus solely on genetic predispositions", "To understand the internal environment and its impact on health and disease", "To prioritize pharmaceutical interventions over lifestyle changes", "To ignore the role of the gut microbiome"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'terrain' refers to the internal environment of the body, including factors like pH balance, oxidative stress, and immune function, which can influence susceptibility to disease."
