            "question": "Which of the following is a primary consideration when providing sex therapy to individuals with disabilities?",
            "options": ["Assuming a lack of sexual interest or capacity.", "Focusing solely on physical limitations.", "Addressing ableism and societal barriers.", "Ignoring the impact of disability on identity."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing ableism and societal barriers is crucial as it acknowledges the systemic discrimination and prejudice that individuals with disabilities often face, impacting their sexual experiences and self-perception. Focusing solely on physical limitations or assuming a lack of interest is harmful and inaccurate."

            "question": "A client who identifies as asexual reports feeling pressure from their partner to engage in sexual activity. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate intervention?",
            "options": ["Suggesting the client try different sexual activities to 'find what they like'.", "Exploring the client's feelings and boundaries related to sex and intimacy.", "Advising the partner to be more patient and understanding.", "Recommending couples therapy focused on increasing sexual frequency."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring the client's feelings and boundaries is paramount. Asexual individuals experience a lack of sexual attraction, and pressuring them to engage in sexual activity is invalidating and potentially harmful. The intervention should focus on respecting the client's identity and facilitating open communication with their partner."

            "options": ["Approximately 10%.", "Approximately 25%.", "Approximately 50%.", "Approximately 80%."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client with chronic pain reports that their pain is exacerbated during sexual activity. Which of the following strategies might be helpful?",
            "options": ["Suggesting complete abstinence from sexual activity.", "Encouraging the client to 'push through' the pain.", "Exploring alternative positions and timing sexual activity around pain medication.", "Recommending that the client focus solely on their partner's pleasure."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exploring alternative positions and timing sexual activity around pain medication can help manage pain and improve sexual experiences for individuals with chronic pain. Complete abstinence is not always necessary, and 'pushing through' the pain can worsen the condition. Focusing solely on the partner's pleasure disregards the client's needs and experiences."

            "question": "Which of the following is a common age-related physiological change that can affect sexual function in older adults?",
            "options": ["Increased vaginal lubrication in women.", "Increased testosterone levels in men.", "Decreased sensitivity of nerve endings.", "Increased pelvic floor muscle strength."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Decreased sensitivity of nerve endings is a common age-related change that can affect sexual function in older adults. This can lead to reduced sensation and difficulty achieving orgasm. Vaginal lubrication typically decreases in women, and testosterone levels often decline in men with age."

            "question": "A client is in recovery from sex addiction and reports struggling with managing triggers and urges. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to avoid all situations that could be potentially triggering.", "Recommending the client engage in 'controlled' acting out to reduce urges.", "Developing a relapse prevention plan that includes identifying triggers, coping strategies, and support systems.", "Advising the client to suppress all sexual thoughts and feelings."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Developing a relapse prevention plan is essential for individuals in recovery from sex addiction. This plan should include identifying triggers, developing coping strategies to manage urges, and establishing a strong support system. Avoiding all potentially triggering situations is often unrealistic, and 'controlled' acting out can reinforce addictive behaviors."

            "question": "A postpartum client reports experiencing a significant decrease in sexual desire and difficulty with arousal. She is breastfeeding and feeling overwhelmed with new motherhood. What is the MOST likely contributing factor?",
            "options": ["Lack of attraction to her partner.", "Hormonal changes and fatigue associated with breastfeeding and postpartum recovery.", "A history of childhood trauma.", "A hidden desire to end the relationship."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hormonal changes (particularly decreased estrogen) and fatigue associated with breastfeeding and postpartum recovery are common contributors to decreased sexual desire and arousal in postpartum individuals. While other factors could play a role, the physiological and emotional demands of new motherhood are often the primary drivers."

            "question": "A sex therapist is working with a transgender client who is considering gender-affirming surgery. What is the therapist's ethical responsibility regarding informed consent?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist has an ethical responsibility to provide the client with comprehensive information about the potential benefits, risks, and alternatives to surgery. This ensures that the client can make an informed decision about their healthcare. The therapist should not discourage or advocate for surgery but rather support the client's autonomy."

            "options": ["Ignoring the client's substance use history to focus solely on sexual issues.", "Assuming that the client's sexual problems are solely a result of their substance abuse.", "Assessing the client's current substance use and addressing any active addiction issues concurrently with sex therapy.", "Recommending that the client discontinue all substance use immediately before starting sex therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assessing the client's current substance use and addressing any active addiction issues concurrently with sex therapy is crucial. Substance abuse can significantly impact sexual function and intimacy, and addressing these issues simultaneously is essential for successful treatment. Ignoring the substance use history or assuming it is the sole cause of the problems is insufficient."

            "question": "Case Study: Sarah, a 68-year-old woman, reports decreased sexual desire following a hysterectomy. She expresses feeling 'less of a woman.' Which intervention would be MOST appropriate initially?",
            "options": ["Prescribing hormone replacement therapy immediately.", "Exploring Sarah's feelings about her body image, femininity, and the impact of the surgery on her sexual self-concept.", "Recommending that Sarah focus on other forms of intimacy besides sexual activity.", "Suggesting that Sarah try using vibrators to increase arousal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring Sarah's feelings about her body image, femininity, and the impact of the surgery on her sexual self-concept is the most appropriate initial intervention. The surgery may have impacted her self-perception and sense of womanhood, which can contribute to decreased sexual desire. Addressing these emotional and psychological factors is essential before considering other interventions."
