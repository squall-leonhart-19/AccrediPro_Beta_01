            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical first step in developing a successful sex education program, according to the principles outlined in L1?",
            "options": ["Defining program goals and objectives", "Conducting a thorough needs assessment", "Securing funding for the program", "Recruiting qualified instructors"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A needs assessment identifies the specific gaps in knowledge and attitudes within the target audience, ensuring the program addresses relevant issues. Neglecting this step can lead to a program that misses the mark and fails to meet the community's actual needs, as highlighted in the case study involving the 'Healthy Choices' program in L1."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "In L2, we discussed the importance of SMART goals. Which of the following goals BEST exemplifies the 'Measurable' aspect of the SMART framework?",
            "options": ["To improve participants' understanding of consent", "To increase participants' confidence in communicating about sex", "To reduce the rate of STIs among participants by 15% within one year", "To provide participants with information about contraception"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A measurable goal includes a specific metric and timeframe, allowing for clear tracking of progress. Reducing STIs by 15% within one year provides a quantifiable target. This directly relates to the discussion of outcome-oriented goals in L2 and their role in effective program evaluation."

            "question": "According to L3, which of the following is a KEY consideration when selecting content for a sex education program targeting adolescents?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on abstinence-only education", "Using complex medical jargon to ensure accuracy", "Ensuring the content is age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and evidence-based", "Ignoring the role of technology and social media in shaping sexual attitudes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Age-appropriateness, cultural sensitivity, and evidence-based content are crucial for effectively engaging adolescents and promoting positive sexual health outcomes. The curriculum should be tailored to their developmental stage and cultural background. Ignoring these factors can lead to disengagement and ineffective learning, a point emphasized by the research cited in L3 regarding adolescent sexual health education."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "L4 emphasizes the importance of logistical planning for program implementation. Which of the following logistical considerations is MOST critical for ensuring participant accessibility?",
            "options": ["Developing visually appealing marketing materials", "Selecting a convenient location and time for program sessions", "Creating a detailed budget for program expenses", "Hiring experienced facilitators"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A convenient location and time are essential for maximizing participant attendance and engagement. Barriers to access, such as transportation difficulties or conflicting schedules, can significantly reduce program participation. This aligns with the principles of accessibility discussed in L4, which highlighted the impact of logistical factors on program reach."

            "question": "The PLEASURE Framework™ (L5) emphasizes various aspects of program design. What does the 'R' in the PLEASURE Framework™ stand for?",
            "options": ["Respectful", "Relevant", "Realistic", "Reflective"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'R' in the PLEASURE Framework™ stands for 'Relevant,' highlighting the importance of tailoring the program content to the specific needs and interests of the target audience. This ensures that participants find the information useful and engaging, as demonstrated by the case study of the 'Sex Positive Seniors' program in L5."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In L6, we explored different evaluation methods. Which of the following data collection methods is BEST suited for assessing changes in participants' attitudes and beliefs about sexuality?",
            "options": ["Administering a pre- and post-program knowledge quiz", "Conducting focus group discussions with participants", "Tracking program attendance rates", "Reviewing program budget expenditures"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Focus group discussions allow for in-depth exploration of participants' attitudes, beliefs, and experiences, providing valuable qualitative data on the program's impact. While quizzes can assess knowledge gains, focus groups are better suited for understanding attitudinal shifts, consistent with the evaluation strategies discussed in L6."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "According to L7, what is the MOST effective strategy for ensuring the long-term sustainability of a sex education program?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on short-term grant funding", "Establishing partnerships with community organizations and stakeholders", "Ignoring the need for ongoing program evaluation", "Failing to adapt the program to changing community needs"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Building strong partnerships with community organizations and stakeholders creates a network of support that can provide resources, expertise, and advocacy for the program. This collaborative approach enhances the program's resilience and sustainability. This reflects the emphasis on community engagement in L7 as a key factor in long-term program viability."

            "question": "L8 emphasized ethical considerations. Which of the following actions would be considered a violation of ethical boundaries in a sex education program?",
            "options": ["Providing participants with accurate and evidence-based information", "Maintaining confidentiality regarding participants' personal disclosures", "Engaging in a romantic relationship with a program participant", "Respecting participants' diverse values and beliefs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Engaging in a romantic relationship with a program participant constitutes a clear violation of professional boundaries and ethical guidelines. This can create a conflict of interest and exploit the power imbalance inherent in the educator-participant relationship, directly contradicting the ethical principles outlined in L8."

            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A program aims to increase condom use among young adults. Evaluation data reveals participants understand the benefits of condoms, but still don't use them consistently. According to L5 (PLEASURE Framework™), which aspect of the program needs MOST attention?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the program is evidence-based", "Making the program location accessible", "Addressing self-efficacy and skills building related to condom use", "Increasing the length of the program sessions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If participants understand the benefits (knowledge), but don't use condoms, the issue likely lies in their self-efficacy (confidence in their ability to use condoms correctly) and skills. The 'Empowering' component of the PLEASURE Framework™ directly addresses this by focusing on building practical skills and confidence. The stat from L5 about self-efficacy predicting behavior change supports this."

            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "A needs assessment reveals a community's sex education program is failing to reach LGBTQ+ youth. Which strategy, based on L1-L3, is MOST likely to improve inclusivity?",
            "options": ["Maintaining the current curriculum to ensure consistency", "Partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations to co-design and deliver culturally responsive content", "Focusing solely on abstinence-only messaging to avoid controversy", "Ignoring the specific needs of LGBTQ+ youth due to limited resources"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations ensures the program is culturally responsive, addresses the specific needs of LGBTQ+ youth, and is delivered in a way that is safe and affirming. This aligns with the principles of cultural sensitivity and inclusivity discussed in L1-L3. According to the case study in L1, programs developed in collaboration with the target community are significantly more effective."
