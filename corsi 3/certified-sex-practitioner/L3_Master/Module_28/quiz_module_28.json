            "options": ["Determining if the interests cause distress, impairment, or harm to self or others.", "Consulting the DSM-5-TR criteria for all paraphilias.", "Informing the client that any unusual sexual interest is inherently pathological.", "Immediately referring the client for aversion therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The key determinant of whether a sexual interest constitutes a paraphilic disorder is whether it causes significant distress, impairment in functioning, or harm to self or others. The presence of the interest alone is not sufficient for diagnosis."
