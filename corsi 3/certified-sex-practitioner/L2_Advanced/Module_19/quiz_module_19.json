            "question": "Which research methodology is BEST suited for exploring the lived experiences of individuals undergoing gender affirmation surgery?",
            "options": ["Randomized Controlled Trial", "Cross-sectional Survey", "Phenomenological Study", "Correlational Study"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phenomenological studies are designed to explore and describe the lived experiences and meanings of a phenomenon, making them ideal for understanding the subjective experiences of individuals undergoing gender affirmation surgery."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A study reports a Cronbach's alpha of 0.65 for a newly developed scale measuring sexual satisfaction. What does this suggest about the scale's reliability?",
            "options": ["Excellent internal consistency", "Good internal consistency", "Acceptable internal consistency", "Questionable internal consistency"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Cronbach's alpha values range from 0 to 1. Generally, values above 0.7 are considered acceptable, and values above 0.8 are considered good. A value of 0.65 suggests questionable internal consistency, indicating that some items may not be measuring the same construct consistently."

            "question": "Which database is MOST comprehensive for finding research articles related to sexual health and behavior?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed", "PsycINFO", "Web of Science"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "PsycINFO is a database specifically focused on psychology and related fields, including sexuality. It offers comprehensive coverage of scholarly literature, making it a strong choice for finding research articles related to sexual health and behavior."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In a meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for premature ejaculation, a researcher identifies significant heterogeneity between studies. Which statistical method is MOST appropriate to address this heterogeneity?",
            "options": ["Fixed-effects model", "Funnel plot analysis", "Random-effects model", "Forest plot analysis"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A random-effects model is more appropriate when significant heterogeneity exists between studies in a meta-analysis. It assumes that the true effect size varies across studies, accounting for the observed differences."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "A sex therapist is working with a client experiencing vaginismus. According to evidence-based practice principles, what should be the FIRST step in selecting an intervention?",
            "options": ["Relying on their clinical intuition", "Consulting with experienced colleagues", "Conducting a thorough assessment of the client's specific needs and preferences", "Implementing the intervention they are most familiar with"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice emphasizes the importance of integrating the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and client values. Therefore, the first step should be a thorough assessment of the client's specific needs and preferences to inform the selection of an appropriate intervention."

        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a KEY component of evidence-based practice in sex therapy?",
            "options": ["Ignoring client preferences to follow established protocols", "Relying solely on personal experience and intuition", "Integrating research evidence, clinical expertise, and client values", "Using only interventions that have been proven effective in randomized controlled trials"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-based practice involves a three-pronged approach, emphasizing the integration of research evidence, clinical expertise, and client values to inform clinical decision-making."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A popular article claims that a specific supplement can increase libido by 300% based on a single, small study with no control group. What critical thinking question should you FIRST ask when evaluating this claim?",
            "options": ["Is the supplement expensive?", "Who funded the study?", "Is the author a medical doctor?", "Was there a control group and was the sample size adequate?"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The absence of a control group and a small sample size significantly limit the validity of the study's findings. It's crucial to determine if the study controlled for confounding variables and had sufficient statistical power before accepting the claim."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "When designing a research study to investigate the effectiveness of a new sex education program, what is the MOST important ethical consideration?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the program is entertaining and engaging", "Obtaining informed consent from all participants", "Guaranteeing that the program will improve participants' sexual knowledge", "Publishing the results regardless of the findings"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Obtaining informed consent is paramount in research involving human subjects. Participants must be fully informed about the study's purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits, and they must have the right to withdraw at any time without penalty."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A researcher wants to investigate the correlation between pornography consumption and relationship satisfaction. They recruit participants online and ask them to complete a survey. What is a potential limitation of this study design?",
            "options": ["Lack of statistical power", "High internal validity", "Sampling bias", "Difficulty in obtaining informed consent"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recruiting participants online can lead to sampling bias, as the sample may not be representative of the broader population. Individuals who are more comfortable discussing or engaging with online surveys about sensitive topics like pornography consumption may be overrepresented."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "You are reviewing a research article and notice that the confidence intervals for the primary outcome measure are very wide. What does this suggest about the study's findings?",
            "options": ["The findings are statistically significant and practically meaningful.", "The findings are precise and reliable.", "The findings are likely due to chance.", "The findings are uncertain and should be interpreted with caution."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Wide confidence intervals indicate a high degree of uncertainty around the estimated effect size. This suggests that the study's findings may not be precise or reliable and should be interpreted with caution."
