            "id": "q22_2",
            "question": "A therapist receives a subpoena to release a client's confidential information in court. According to ethical guidelines, what is the therapist's INITIAL course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately release the records to comply with the subpoena.", "Contact the client to discuss the subpoena and obtain informed consent for release of information.", "Ignore the subpoena to protect client confidentiality.", "Release only the information requested by the court, omitting sensitive details."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q22_3",
            "question": "Dr. Ramirez, a sex therapist, begins dating a former client two years after terminating therapy. Ethically, is this permissible?",
            "options": ["Yes, because the therapeutic relationship has been terminated.", "No, because dual relationships are always unethical.", "Potentially unethical; the burden of proof is on Dr. Ramirez to demonstrate that the relationship is not exploitative.", "Yes, as long as Dr. Ramirez refers the client to another therapist for any future needs."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While not strictly prohibited after a certain period, such relationships require careful consideration. The therapist must ensure the relationship is not exploitative, as discussed in L3. Guidelines often suggest a minimum waiting period, but context is crucial."

            "explanation": "Practicing without a license in a specific jurisdiction violates the principle of <span class=\"highlight\">non-maleficence</span> (do no harm) and competence, as discussed in L4 and L6, because the therapist is operating outside of legal and regulatory boundaries and potentially harming the client."
