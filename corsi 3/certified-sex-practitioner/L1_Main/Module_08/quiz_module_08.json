            "question": "Which of the following BEST describes sexual empowerment?",
            "options": ["Achieving orgasm during every sexual encounter.", "Conforming to societal expectations of sexual behavior.", "Having the freedom to make informed and autonomous decisions about one's sexuality.", "Suppressing one's desires to please a partner."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sexual empowerment is about autonomy, informed decision-making, and the freedom to express one's sexuality on one's own terms. It is not about conforming to societal norms or solely focusing on orgasm."

        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, what percentage of women report experiencing some form of body image anxiety that impacts their sexual experiences?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports feeling disconnected from her body during sex. Which of the following techniques would be MOST effective in helping her cultivate body awareness and sensuality?",
            "options": ["Engaging in rigorous exercise to improve physical fitness.", "Practicing mindfulness and focusing on physical sensations.", "Avoiding sexual activity until she feels more confident.", "Using alcohol to relax and reduce inhibitions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness and focusing on physical sensations can help individuals reconnect with their bodies and enhance sensuality. Exercise is beneficial for overall health, but may not directly address the issue of disconnection during sex. Avoiding sex or using alcohol are not healthy or sustainable solutions."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Assertive communication involves expressing one's needs respectfully and honestly, while also respecting the boundaries of others. Guilt and manipulation are counterproductive and harmful in healthy relationships."

            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "What does it mean to 'reclaim sexual narratives'?",
            "options": ["Accepting only traditional views of sex and sexuality.", "Challenging and rewriting personal and societal stories about sex.", "Ignoring negative experiences and focusing only on positive ones.", "Blaming others for one's sexual experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reclaiming sexual narratives involves actively challenging and rewriting the stories we tell ourselves and that society tells us about sex, sexuality, and our own experiences. It's about taking ownership and creating narratives that are empowering and authentic."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which cognitive technique is MOST helpful in overcoming sexual anxiety and inhibitions?",
            "options": ["Thought suppression.", "Cognitive restructuring.", "Avoidance of triggering situations.", "Engaging in risky sexual behavior to desensitize oneself."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring involves identifying and challenging negative or irrational thoughts that contribute to anxiety, replacing them with more positive and realistic ones. Thought suppression is often ineffective and can backfire. Avoidance reinforces anxiety, and risky behavior is dangerous."

            "options": ["Focusing solely on achieving orgasm.", "Ignoring one's own needs to please a partner.", "Communicating one's preferences and exploring different types of touch.", "Rushing through the experience to avoid discomfort."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["Avoiding all stressful situations.", "Developing coping mechanisms and self-care practices.", "Relying solely on his partner for support.", "Ignoring his feelings and pushing through the stress."],

            "options": ["It is unnecessary as sexual empowerment is an individual journey.", "It can provide validation, reduce feelings of isolation, and offer diverse perspectives.", "It encourages conformity to group norms, limiting individual expression.", "It can lead to increased judgment and criticism from others."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Community support can be invaluable in sustaining sexual empowerment by providing validation, reducing feelings of isolation, offering diverse perspectives, and fostering a sense of belonging. While individual journeys are important, community support can enhance and reinforce personal empowerment."
