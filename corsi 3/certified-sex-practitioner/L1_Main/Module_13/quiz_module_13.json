            "question": "A client reports experiencing flashbacks and emotional numbing related to past sexual trauma. Which therapeutic approach is MOST likely to be effective in addressing these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Exposure therapy focused on the details of the traumatic event", "Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy", "Cognitive restructuring to challenge negative thoughts about sexuality", "Prescription of SSRIs to manage anxiety and depression"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EMDR therapy is a well-established treatment for trauma, helping clients process distressing memories and reduce associated symptoms like flashbacks and emotional numbing. A meta-analysis by Cusack et al. (2016) demonstrated EMDR's efficacy in treating PTSD symptoms related to sexual trauma."

            "question": "When working with a couple where one partner has significantly higher sexual desire than the other, which communication strategy is MOST likely to be helpful in bridging the desire gap?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the higher-desire partner to suppress their desires to match their partner's", "Teaching the couple to engage in non-demand pleasuring and explore each other's erogenous zones", "Suggesting separate bedrooms to avoid conflict", "Focusing solely on the lower-desire partner's reasons for low desire"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Non-demand pleasuring can help reduce pressure and anxiety around sex, allowing both partners to explore intimacy and pleasure without the expectation of intercourse. This approach can help bridge the desire gap and create a more fulfilling sexual relationship. According to McCarthy & McCarthy (2003), sensate focus exercises are effective in reducing performance anxiety and increasing sexual pleasure."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Body scan meditation helps clients cultivate awareness of bodily sensations, which can enhance their ability to connect with their body and experience sexual pleasure. A study by Brotto et al. (2008) found that mindfulness-based interventions improved sexual function and satisfaction in women with sexual difficulties."

            "question": "An 80-year-old client reports a decline in sexual function and expresses feelings of shame and inadequacy. What is the MOST appropriate initial response?",
            "options": ["Reassuring the client that sexual function naturally declines with age and is no longer important", "Exploring the client's beliefs and expectations about sexuality in later life and normalizing age-related changes", "Suggesting the client consider hormone replacement therapy without further discussion", "Focusing solely on the client's physical health and ignoring the emotional aspect"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Exploring the client's beliefs and expectations about sexuality in later life and normalizing age-related changes can help reduce shame and promote acceptance. It's important to acknowledge that sexuality remains a significant aspect of well-being for many older adults. Data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) indicates that a significant percentage of older adults remain sexually active and interested in sex."

            "question": "A therapist receives a subpoena to release a client's sexual history records in a legal case. What is the therapist's MOST ethical course of action?",
            "options": ["Immediately releasing the records to comply with the subpoena", "Contacting the client to discuss the subpoena and explore options for protecting their privacy, such as asserting privilege", "Ignoring the subpoena to protect the client's confidentiality", "Releasing only the information that is directly relevant to the legal case"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The therapist's ethical obligation is to protect the client's confidentiality to the fullest extent possible. Contacting the client, discussing the subpoena, and exploring options for asserting privilege is the most ethical course of action. Standard 5.06 of the APA Ethics Code addresses requests for confidential information."

            "question": "A client with a history of childhood sexual abuse reports experiencing vaginismus. Which of the following interventions is MOST likely to be contraindicated?",
            "options": ["Use of vaginal dilators in a gradual and self-paced manner", "Referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist", "Exposure therapy involving direct and immediate vaginal penetration", "Mindfulness-based exercises to reduce anxiety and tension"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Exposure therapy involving direct and immediate vaginal penetration is likely to be contraindicated, as it could retraumatize the client and exacerbate their vaginismus. A gradual and self-paced approach, such as using vaginal dilators, is more appropriate. Research by Reissing et al. (2005) supports the use of gradual exposure in treating vaginismus."

            "question": "Which of the following scenarios BEST exemplifies the application of the 'Empowerment' aspect within the Pleasure Framework™?",
            "options": ["A client learning about the anatomy of the clitoris", "A client practicing deep breathing exercises to reduce performance anxiety", "A client identifying and challenging internalized messages that sex should be painful or shameful", "A client exploring different types of lubricants to enhance sensation"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Identifying and challenging internalized messages that sex should be painful or shameful directly addresses the 'Empowerment' aspect of the Pleasure Framework™, which focuses on dismantling limiting beliefs and fostering a positive sense of self in relation to sexuality. This aligns with the work of Dr. Laurie Mintz, who emphasizes the importance of challenging societal scripts about sex."
