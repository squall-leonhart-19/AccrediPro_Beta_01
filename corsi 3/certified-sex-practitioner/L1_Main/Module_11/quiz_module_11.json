            "question": "A client reports experiencing significant sexual shame related to childhood religious teachings. Which of the following advanced techniques would be MOST appropriate to initiate in the early stages of therapy?",
            "options": ["Exposure therapy involving revisiting past religious experiences.", "Cognitive restructuring focusing on challenging shame-based beliefs and promoting self-compassion.", "Prescribing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to manage anxiety associated with shame.", "Suggesting the client immediately engage in partnered sexual activity to reclaim their sexuality."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cognitive restructuring and self-compassion exercises are evidence-based approaches to addressing shame by challenging negative thought patterns and fostering self-acceptance. Exposure therapy may be considered later, but is generally not a first-line intervention."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "During an embodiment exercise, a client becomes highly dissociative and reports feeling detached from their body. What is the MOST appropriate immediate intervention?",
            "options": ["Encourage the client to push through the dissociation to access deeper emotions.", "Gently guide the client back to the present moment using grounding techniques such as focusing on sensory details (e.g., feeling their feet on the floor).", "Immediately terminate the session and refer the client to a trauma specialist.", "Administer a mild sedative to help the client relax."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques are crucial for bringing a client back to the present moment during dissociation. Pushing through can be retraumatizing. Referring to a trauma specialist is a good long-term strategy, but immediate grounding is necessary."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "A couple presents with mismatched libidos and conflicting attachment styles (one anxious, one avoidant). Which of the following interventions would be MOST effective in addressing their sexual dynamic?",
            "options": ["Prescribing testosterone for the partner with lower libido.", "Individual therapy for each partner focusing on their attachment styles, combined with couples therapy to improve communication and address sexual needs.", "Encouraging the couple to engage in more frequent sexual activity, regardless of desire levels.", "Recommending an open relationship to address the mismatch in libidos."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing attachment styles in individual therapy allows each partner to understand their patterns, while couples therapy facilitates communication and negotiation around sexual needs. This comprehensive approach is more effective than solely focusing on medication or suggesting non-monogamy without addressing underlying issues."

            "question": "When working with a transgender client exploring their sexuality, what is the MOST important initial step?",
            "options": ["Assuming their sexual preferences based on their gender identity.", "Providing education on all available sexual positions.", "Creating a safe and affirming space to explore their desires, attractions, and experiences without judgment.", "Encouraging them to conform to societal expectations of their gender identity."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Creating a safe and affirming space is paramount when working with transgender clients. This allows them to explore their sexuality authentically without feeling pressured or judged. Assumptions and encouragement to conform are harmful and unethical."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "A client reports difficulty reaching orgasm despite adequate arousal. Applying sensate focus techniques, what is the NEXT step after the initial non-demand pleasuring exercises?",
            "options": ["Direct genital stimulation with the goal of orgasm.", "Exploring partnered massage without genital contact.", "Self-stimulation with the goal of identifying pleasurable sensations without focusing on orgasm.", "Abstaining from all sexual activity for two weeks."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "After non-demand pleasuring, the next step in sensate focus is typically self-stimulation to explore pleasurable sensations without the pressure of achieving orgasm. This helps the client become more attuned to their body and reduce performance anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q11_6",
            "question": "A client with a history of sexual trauma presents with vaginismus. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate and evidence-based approach?",
            "options": ["Suggesting immediate penetration with dilators.", "Providing psychoeducation about trauma and its impact on the body, combined with gradual exposure therapy using dilators and pelvic floor physical therapy.", "Recommending a surgical procedure to widen the vaginal opening.", "Ignoring the trauma history and focusing solely on the physical symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Psychoeducation about trauma and its impact is crucial for addressing the psychological component of vaginismus. Gradual exposure therapy with dilators and pelvic floor physical therapy are evidence-based physical interventions. Surgical procedures are rarely necessary and do not address the underlying trauma."

            "id": "q11_7",
            "question": "A therapist begins to develop strong feelings of attraction towards a client. According to ethical guidelines, what is the MOST appropriate course of action?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the feelings and continuing therapy as usual.", "Disclosing the feelings to the client and exploring the possibility of a romantic relationship.", "Seeking supervision or consultation from a qualified colleague to process the feelings and ensure ethical practice.", "Immediately terminating therapy and referring the client to another therapist without explanation."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Seeking supervision or consultation is the most ethical response. It allows the therapist to process their feelings, understand the potential impact on the client, and develop strategies to maintain professional boundaries. Acting on the feelings or abruptly terminating therapy without explanation are unethical and potentially harmful."

            "question": "When using the P.L.E.A.S.U.R.E. framework for case conceptualization, what does the 'E' represent?",
            "options": ["Emotions", "Erection", "Education", "Engagement"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the P.L.E.A.S.U.R.E. framework, 'E' stands for Emotions, which encompasses the client's feelings and emotional experiences related to their sexuality."

            "id": "q11_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of childhood sexual abuse reports experiencing flashbacks during sexual activity with their partner. What is the MOST appropriate intervention to implement?",
            "options": ["Encourage the client to avoid sexual activity altogether to prevent further flashbacks.", "Teach the client grounding techniques and distress tolerance skills to manage flashbacks during sexual encounters, and consider EMDR or other trauma-focused therapy.", "Suggest the client confront their abuser to resolve the trauma.", "Tell the client that the flashbacks are just memories and they should try to ignore them."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Teaching grounding techniques and distress tolerance skills empowers the client to manage flashbacks in the moment. EMDR or other trauma-focused therapies can help process the underlying trauma. Avoidance is not a long-term solution, and confronting the abuser can be retraumatizing."

            "id": "q11_10",
            "question": "A therapist receives a gift from a client that exceeds the value considered ethically acceptable. What is the MOST appropriate response?",
            "options": ["Accept the gift graciously to avoid hurting the client's feelings.", "Politely decline the gift, explaining the ethical guidelines regarding gifts in therapy, and explore the client's motivation for offering the gift.", "Accept the gift but donate it to charity anonymously.", "Report the client to the licensing board for attempting to cross professional boundaries."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Politely declining the gift while explaining ethical guidelines is the most appropriate response. This allows the therapist to maintain boundaries and explore the client's underlying motivations without causing undue harm. Accepting the gift or reporting the client without attempting to understand their intentions are less ethical options."
