            "options": ["Administering standardized questionnaires.", "Establishing rapport and trust with the family.", "Observing the child's behavior in a structured setting.", "Reviewing the child's academic records."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing rapport is crucial as it facilitates open communication and honesty, leading to more accurate and valuable insights. As noted in L1, trust is the foundation."

            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to observational techniques discussed in L2, what is the primary benefit of using an 'ABC' chart (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence)?",
            "options": ["To quickly diagnose underlying psychological disorders.", "To identify patterns and triggers related to specific child behaviors.", "To objectively rank the severity of different behavioral issues.", "To provide concrete evidence for disciplinary action."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "ABC charts are designed to understand the context surrounding a behavior, allowing parents to identify triggers and consequences that may be reinforcing undesirable actions. This is a key concept from L2."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "In L3, effective questioning strategies are discussed. Which type of question is MOST likely to elicit detailed and insightful responses from a parent about their child's emotional regulation?",
            "options": ["A leading question (e.g., 'Don't you think he's just being stubborn?')", "A closed-ended question (e.g., 'Does he get angry often?')", "An open-ended question (e.g., 'Tell me more about how he expresses his frustration.')", "A rhetorical question (e.g., 'Why does he always act this way?')"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions encourage detailed responses, providing richer information about the parent's perspective and the child's behavior. This is a cornerstone of effective questioning."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "A conscious parenting coach is working with a family where sibling rivalry is a major issue. According to L4, which approach would be MOST effective in assessing the family dynamics contributing to this rivalry?",
            "options": ["Administering individual personality tests to each child.", "Focusing solely on the academic performance of each child.", "Observing family interactions during mealtimes and play, and interviewing each family member individually.", "Recommending a strict set of rules and punishments for any instance of rivalry."],

            "options": ["Using only assessments developed by well-known psychologists.", "Ensuring the assessments are culturally sensitive and appropriate for the family's background.", "Administering as many different assessments as possible to cover all potential issues.", "Interpreting the results based solely on the assessment's scoring guidelines."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cultural sensitivity is paramount to avoid misinterpretations and ensure the assessment accurately reflects the family's experiences. L5 emphasizes the importance of culturally appropriate tools."

            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "A coach has gathered a large amount of information from interviews, observations, and questionnaires. According to L6, what is the BEST way to organize this information to facilitate effective analysis and coaching?",
            "options": ["Discarding any data that appears inconsistent or contradictory.", "Creating a detailed narrative report focusing on the most dramatic incidents.", "Using a structured system such as a spreadsheet or mind map to categorize and link different data points.", "Presenting the raw data to the parents and asking them to draw their own conclusions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A structured system allows for easy identification of patterns, themes, and discrepancies, which is essential for effective analysis. L6 provides guidance on various documentation methods."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Confirmation bias involves selectively attending to information that supports one's pre-existing beliefs, which can distort the coach's understanding of the family dynamics. L7 dedicates itself to bias recognition."

            "id": "q1_8",

            "options": ["Initial assessments provide a complete picture of the family's dynamics, so ongoing insight gathering is unnecessary.", "Ongoing insight gathering allows the coach to adapt their strategies and address evolving needs and challenges.", "Ongoing insight gathering is only necessary if the family fails to make progress within the first few sessions.", "Ongoing insight gathering primarily serves to justify the coach's initial assessment and recommendations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Families are dynamic, and their needs and challenges evolve over time. Ongoing insight gathering allows the coach to tailor their approach and provide more effective support. Iteration is key."
