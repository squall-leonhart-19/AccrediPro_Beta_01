            "question": "In the GUIDE framework, the 'Gather Insights' (G) stage primarily focuses on:",
            "options": ["Implementing immediate behavioral interventions.", "Collecting comprehensive information about the family's dynamics and challenges.", "Providing direct advice and solutions to parenting problems.", "Establishing a rigid set of rules for the family to follow."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Gather Insights' stage is dedicated to understanding the family's context, challenges, and dynamics through various data collection methods."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a key component of advanced active listening?",
            "options": ["Reflecting back the speaker's emotions.", "Interrupting to offer helpful suggestions.", "Using open-ended questions to encourage elaboration.", "Summarizing the speaker's points to ensure understanding."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Interrupting breaks the flow of communication and can make the speaker feel unheard. Active listening prioritizes understanding and empathy before offering suggestions."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "During a home visit, you observe that a child consistently seeks attention from the parent who is visibly stressed and occupied with work. According to Family Systems Theory, this behavior might indicate:",
            "options": ["The child is inherently attention-seeking.", "A dysfunctional boundary within the family system.", "The parent is intentionally ignoring the child.", "The child is manipulating the parent."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Family Systems Theory suggests that behaviors are interconnected within the system. The child's behavior could be a way to regulate the family's emotional equilibrium, highlighting a boundary issue."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "A parent consistently yells at their child when the child spills food. Identifying the underlying need behind the parent's reaction is crucial. Which underlying need is MOST likely driving this behavior?",
            "options": ["The need for control.", "The need for cleanliness.", "The need for the child to be perfect.", "All of the above."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While seemingly about the spilled food, the reaction likely stems from a deeper need for control, order, and perhaps unrealistic expectations of the child."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Culturally sensitive questioning involves actively seeking to understand the family's cultural background and how it influences their parenting practices, without making assumptions."

The 'Gather Insights' stage revealed that the parents lacked consistent routines and support. What is the MOST appropriate next step in transitioning to the 'Uncover Patterns' (U) stage?",
            "options": ["Immediately implementing a strict behavioral plan for the child.", "Analyzing the collected data to identify recurring patterns and triggers related to the parents' stress and the child's behavior.", "Concluding that the parents are simply incapable of managing their child's ADHD.", "Referrals for medication management without further analysis."],

            "explanation": "Transitioning to the 'Uncover Patterns' stage involves analyzing the gathered information to identify recurring themes, triggers, and patterns that contribute to the family's challenges."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Uncover Patterns' stage is about making sense of the collected data, identifying root causes, and understanding the interconnectedness of various factors influencing the family's dynamics."
