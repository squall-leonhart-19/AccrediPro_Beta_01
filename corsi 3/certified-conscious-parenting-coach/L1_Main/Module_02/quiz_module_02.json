            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Maintaining a detailed journal allows for objective observation and identification of recurring patterns before implementing interventions. This aligns with the lesson's emphasis on data collection."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional flooding describes the overwhelming of rational thought by intense emotions, hindering effective parenting as discussed in L2."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional triggers are stimuli that evoke intense emotional reactions based on past experiences. The scenario highlights how a parent's childhood abandonment issues trigger anxiety (L4)."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Applying 'U' involves first understanding the patterns. Observing and documenting the tantrums helps identify triggers and patterns before intervening. This aligns with the case study methodology in L8."
