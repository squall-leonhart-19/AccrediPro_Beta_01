            "question": "A client with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggles with transitioning between activities. Which advanced strategy for tracking progress would be MOST helpful in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Using a simple checklist to mark completed activities without specific data on transition times.", "Implementing a detailed ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence) data collection system to identify triggers and patterns related to transition difficulties.", "Relying solely on subjective reports from caregivers regarding the client's transition behaviors.", "Focusing primarily on tracking the client's academic performance and ignoring transition-related challenges."],

            "options": ["Treating the Tourette's Syndrome first, as reducing tics will automatically alleviate the OCD symptoms.", "Treating the OCD first, as this is often the more debilitating condition.", "Addressing both conditions simultaneously using evidence-based interventions for each disorder.", "Ignoring the co-occurring OCD and focusing solely on managing the tics associated with Tourette's Syndrome."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Co-occurring conditions should be addressed concurrently using evidence-based interventions tailored to each disorder. Treating one condition in isolation may not effectively address the client's overall needs."
