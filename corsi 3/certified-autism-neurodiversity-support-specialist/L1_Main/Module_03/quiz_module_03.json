            "options": ["Establishing a reward system from the outset.", "Building trust and rapport.", "Immediately focusing on deficits and areas for improvement.", "Using standardized goal-setting templates."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "A client, Alex, expresses a desire to improve their social interactions but struggles to articulate specific goals. Which approach is MOST effective in identifying their values and aspirations?",
            "options": ["Administering a standardized social skills assessment.", "Asking direct 'yes' or 'no' questions about social situations.", "Using visual aids and open-ended questions to explore their interests and preferred social activities.", "Focusing on correcting perceived social errors."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visual aids and open-ended questions facilitate exploration of interests and preferences, allowing Alex to express their aspirations in a way that bypasses potential communication barriers. This aligns with person-centered planning principles."

        {
            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which component is CRITICAL when defining SMART goals with a neurodiversity lens?",
            "options": ["Strict adherence to timelines, regardless of client progress.", "Ensuring goals are solely defined by external expectations (e.g., employer, family).", "Incorporating flexibility and acknowledging potential for adjustments based on individual needs and progress.", "Focusing on achieving goals as quickly as possible to minimize client frustration."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flexibility is crucial because neurodivergent individuals may experience unique challenges and require adjustments to the goal-setting process. Rigid timelines and external expectations can be detrimental to their progress and well-being."

        {
            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "Research suggests that visualization techniques can enhance goal achievement. What is the PRIMARY benefit of goal visualization for neurodivergent clients?",
            "options": ["It distracts them from potential anxieties associated with the goal.", "It provides a concrete and multi-sensory representation of success, enhancing motivation and reducing uncertainty.", "It allows them to ignore potential obstacles.", "It ensures they focus only on the positive aspects of the goal."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Visualization offers a tangible representation of success, which can be particularly helpful for neurodivergent individuals who may benefit from concrete and multi-sensory information. This clarity can boost motivation and alleviate anxieties."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A client with sensory sensitivities is working towards a goal of spending more time in a public library. Which environmental modification would be MOST appropriate to incorporate?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to visit during peak hours to build tolerance.", "Providing noise-canceling headphones and suggesting a less crowded area of the library.", "Discouraging them from bringing any comfort items to promote independence.", "Insisting they sit in the most brightly lit area to improve focus."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing noise-canceling headphones and suggesting a quieter area directly addresses potential sensory overload, making the environment more comfortable and conducive to achieving the goal. This aligns with sensory-informed practice."

            "options": ["Ignoring potential challenges to maintain a positive outlook.", "Developing contingency plans and alternative strategies in advance.", "Blaming the client for lack of progress when challenges arise.", "Abandoning the goal if the first obstacle is encountered."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Developing contingency plans demonstrates foresight and preparedness, allowing for flexible adaptation when challenges inevitably arise. This approach fosters resilience and promotes continued progress."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to research, what type of reinforcement is generally MOST effective in promoting sustained motivation for neurodivergent individuals?",
            "options": ["Extrinsic rewards such as money or prizes.", "Intrinsic rewards such as a sense of accomplishment or increased autonomy.", "Punishment for not meeting intermediate goals.", "Ignoring both successes and failures to avoid influencing motivation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Intrinsic rewards, such as feelings of accomplishment and autonomy, tend to be more sustainable motivators as they tap into internal desires and values. Extrinsic rewards can be helpful but may lose their effectiveness over time."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regular documentation and review allows for continuous monitoring of progress, identification of necessary adjustments, and ensures the goals remain relevant and aligned with the client's evolving needs and aspirations. This promotes a dynamic and responsive approach."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all SMART components are important, the 'Time-bound' component is particularly relevant for Sarah, as it directly addresses her difficulty with deadlines. Setting specific timelines and check-in points can help her manage her time more effectively."
