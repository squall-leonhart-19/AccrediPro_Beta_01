            "question": "Which of the following is an example of using a variable reinforcement schedule, proven effective in a 2018 study by Patel et al., to maintain a learned behavior?",
            "options": [
                "Giving a sticker every time a child completes a math problem.",
                "Providing praise intermittently after a child initiates a conversation, varying the frequency.",
                "Removing a chore from a child's list for every three days of compliant behavior.",
                "Offering a tangible reward at the end of each week if the child meets all behavioral goals."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Variable reinforcement schedules, where reinforcement is delivered after an unpredictable number of responses, are highly effective for maintaining behaviors because the individual doesn't know when to expect the reinforcement, leading to more consistent performance. A fixed schedule leads to anticipation and potential drop off after the reward is given."

            "question": "According to the lesson, what is the PRIMARY purpose of progress monitoring data in supporting neurodivergent individuals?",
            "options": [
                "To provide grades for academic performance.",
                "To make data-driven decisions about interventions and support strategies.",
                "To compare the individual's progress to their neurotypical peers.",
                "To create a standardized report for administrative purposes."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progress monitoring data is used to objectively assess the effectiveness of interventions and make informed adjustments to support strategies, ensuring they are tailored to the individual's needs and promoting optimal outcomes. This allows for personalized and adaptive support, rather than relying on standardized approaches."

            "question": "A client with autism spectrum disorder also presents with symptoms of anxiety. Which of the following approaches would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": [
                "Focus solely on the autism-related challenges first, and address the anxiety later.",
                "Implement interventions targeting both autism and anxiety concurrently, considering their potential interaction.",
                "Refer the client to a specialist solely focused on anxiety, without considering the autism diagnosis.",
                "Encourage the client to suppress their anxiety symptoms to avoid complicating the autism interventions."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing co-occurring conditions requires an integrated approach. Interventions should target both conditions concurrently, recognizing that they may influence each other. Ignoring one condition can hinder progress in the other. A comprehensive approach, as discussed in the lesson, is key for optimal outcomes."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Emotional mirroring involves reflecting the emotional content of a message back to the speaker, demonstrating empathy and understanding. This technique goes beyond simply understanding the words and aims to connect with the individual on an emotional level, fostering trust and rapport."

                "To teach them to suppress their unique traits and preferences."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-advocacy empowers neurodivergent individuals to understand their strengths and needs, communicate them effectively, and navigate systems independently. This is crucial for fostering autonomy, independence, and a sense of control over their lives. It's about empowering, not minimizing, their needs."

            "explanation": "A collaborative approach prioritizes the family's values, culture, and priorities. This involves active listening, open communication, and shared decision-making. Building trust and rapport with the family is essential for effective intervention and positive outcomes. Ignoring the family's perspective can lead to resistance and disengagement."

The client's parents express concern that the technology isolates their child from social interaction. Which ethical principle should guide your decision-making in this scenario?",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The principle of non-maleficence, 'do no harm', is most relevant here. While the technology supports communication (beneficence), the parents' concern highlights potential harm (social isolation). A balanced approach is needed, considering strategies to facilitate social interaction alongside technology use. The other principles are important but less directly applicable in this specific scenario."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Environment' component of the A.C.C.E.P.T. framework emphasizes the importance of modifying and adapting the physical and social surroundings to meet the individual's sensory needs. This might involve reducing noise levels, adjusting lighting, or creating designated quiet spaces."
