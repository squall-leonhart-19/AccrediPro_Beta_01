            "question": "Why is ongoing progress monitoring crucial in supporting individuals with autism and neurodiversity?",
            "options": ["To fulfill administrative requirements only.", "To identify effective interventions and adjust support strategies.", "To compare individuals' progress against neurotypical standards.", "To limit individual autonomy and enforce compliance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ongoing progress monitoring allows for the identification of effective interventions and the adjustment of support strategies to better meet the individual's needs, leading to improved outcomes."

            "options": ["The tool's cost and ease of administration.", "The tool's alignment with the individual's goals and the intervention being used.", "The tool's popularity and widespread use.", "The tool's ability to generate detailed reports for all stakeholders."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most crucial factor is ensuring the tool is aligned with the individual's goals and the specific intervention being implemented to accurately measure progress in those areas."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of establishing baseline data before implementing an intervention?",
            "options": ["To create a standardized comparison group.", "To have data to compare against after the intervention is implemented, to measure progress.", "To identify potential research participants.", "To justify the need for intervention to insurance companies."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Baseline data provides a starting point for measuring progress and determining the effectiveness of an intervention by comparing post-intervention data to the initial baseline."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a measurable goal for an individual with autism who struggles with social interaction?",
            "options": ["To improve social skills.", "To become more social.", "To initiate and maintain a conversation with a peer for at least 5 minutes, twice a week.", "To be less awkward in social situations."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A measurable goal should be specific, quantifiable, and time-bound. 'To initiate and maintain a conversation with a peer for at least 5 minutes, twice a week' meets these criteria."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A support specialist is using a frequency count to track a client's self-stimulatory behaviors. What is the MOST important aspect of implementing this data collection procedure?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the data is collected by multiple observers.", "Defining the target behavior clearly and consistently.", "Collecting data only during structured activities.", "Ignoring any instances of the behavior that occur outside of the designated observation period."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clearly defining the target behavior ensures that data collection is consistent and reliable, leading to accurate progress monitoring. As highlighted in the lessons, inter-rater reliability is also very important."

        {
            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "After analyzing progress data, a support specialist notices that an intervention aimed at improving a client's communication skills has shown minimal progress after 4 weeks. What should be the FIRST course of action?",
            "options": ["Discontinue the intervention immediately.", "Increase the intensity of the intervention without making any other changes.", "Review the data collection procedures to ensure accuracy.", "Consult with the client and other professionals to identify potential barriers and adjust the intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The first step should be to consult with the client and other professionals to understand the reasons for the lack of progress and collaboratively adjust the intervention strategy. This approach aligns with person-centered care."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the setback, providing emotional support, and adjusting the intervention plan demonstrates empathy and responsiveness to the client's changing circumstances, promoting resilience and continued progress."
