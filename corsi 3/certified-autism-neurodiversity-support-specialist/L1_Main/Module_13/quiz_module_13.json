            "id": "q13_1",
            "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the process of shaping in positive reinforcement?",
            "options": ["Reinforcing only the final desired behavior.", "Reinforcing successive approximations toward the desired behavior.", "Punishing undesirable behaviors to discourage them.", "Ignoring all behaviors except the target behavior."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Shaping involves reinforcing successive approximations, gradually guiding the individual towards the desired behavior. This method is particularly useful when the target behavior is complex or not initially displayed."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of fading in the context of reinforcement strategies?",
            "options": ["To increase the intensity of the reinforcement over time.", "To gradually reduce the prompts or assistance needed to perform a behavior.", "To immediately remove all reinforcement to test the individual's retention.", "To switch between different types of reinforcement randomly."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fading aims to reduce reliance on prompts or assistance, promoting independence and generalization of the learned behavior. It's a gradual process of removing support."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_3",
            "question": "A therapist uses a partial interval recording method to track a client's fidgeting behavior. They observe whether the behavior occurred at any point during each 15-minute interval. At the end of the session, the behavior was recorded as present in 6 out of 10 intervals. What is the percentage of intervals the behavior was observed?",
            "options": ["15%", "40%", "60%", "10%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The behavior was observed in 6 out of 10 intervals, which translates to 60%. Partial interval recording is useful for estimating the proportion of time a behavior occurs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q13_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on ethical considerations, what is the MOST important aspect to consider when selecting a reinforcer for a neurodivergent client?",
            "options": ["The therapist's personal preference.", "The client's stated preferences and the potential for harm.", "The reinforcer's cost and availability.", "The reinforcer's novelty and excitement factor."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice prioritizes the client's autonomy and well-being. Choosing reinforcers should be based on their preferences and a careful assessment of any potential risks or negative side effects."

            "id": "q13_5",
            "question": "What does the 'E' in SMARTIE goals stand for?",
            "options": ["Engaging", "Ethical", "Evaluating", "Exciting"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the SMARTIE framework, 'E' stands for Engaging, emphasizing the importance of goals that capture the client's interest and motivation to increase the likelihood of success."

        {
            "id": "q13_6",
            "question": "Which of the following sensory strategies is MOST likely to help a client with tactile defensiveness participate more comfortably in a group activity involving shared materials?",
            "options": ["Exposing the client to a wide variety of textures at once.", "Providing the client with deep pressure input before and during the activity.", "Ignoring the client's discomfort and encouraging them to participate.", "Using brightly colored materials to distract the client."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deep pressure can be calming and can help modulate tactile input, making it easier for individuals with tactile defensiveness to tolerate sensory experiences. Gradual exposure can also be helpful, but deep pressure is often the first step."

        {
            "id": "q13_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key component of building self-advocacy skills through positive reinforcement?",
            "options": ["Encouraging the client to always agree with authority figures.", "Teaching the client to identify their needs and communicate them effectively.", "Discouraging the client from expressing dissenting opinions.", "Focusing solely on compliance with external expectations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Self-advocacy involves understanding one's own needs, communicating them assertively, and working towards having those needs met. Positive reinforcement can be used to encourage and reward these behaviors."

        {
            "id": "q13_8",
            "question": "In the ACCEPT Framework™, what does the 'C' stand for?",
            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring", "Consequences", "Collaboration", "Communication"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the ACCEPT Framework™, 'C' stands for Collaboration, which emphasizes the importance of a collaborative approach between the therapist, client, and other relevant parties."

            "id": "q13_9",
            "question": "In a case study, a 16-year-old client named Alex, diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, struggles with initiating conversations. Using the ACCEPT framework, which of the following would be the MOST effective 'T' (Therapy) intervention?",
            "options": ["Immediately placing Alex in large group settings to force interaction.", "Providing Alex with scripts and role-playing opportunities to practice initiating conversations.", "Ignoring Alex's social difficulties, assuming they will resolve on their own.", "Punishing Alex for not initiating conversations."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Using the ACCEPT framework, therapy (T) should focus on skill-building and providing practical tools. Scripting and role-playing offer a structured and supportive way for Alex to practice and improve their conversation initiation skills."

        {
            "id": "q13_10",
            "question": "According to research on neurodiversity, what percentage of autistic adults report experiencing sensory sensitivities that significantly impact their daily lives?",
            "options": ["Approximately 5%", "Approximately 25%", "Approximately 60-90%", "Less than 1%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that a significant majority, between 60% and 90%, of autistic adults report sensory sensitivities that substantially affect their daily functioning, highlighting the importance of addressing sensory needs in interventions."
