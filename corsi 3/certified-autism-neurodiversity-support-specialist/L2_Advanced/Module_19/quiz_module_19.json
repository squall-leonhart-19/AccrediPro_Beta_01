            "question": "What is the primary goal of evidence-based practice (EBP) in neurodiversity support?",
            "options": ["To solely rely on personal experience and intuition.", "To integrate the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and client values.", "To exclusively follow established protocols without considering individual needs.", "To prioritize anecdotal evidence over empirical data."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "EBP aims to integrate research, clinical expertise, and client values to provide the most effective and appropriate support."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which database is MOST suitable for finding systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to autism interventions?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed/MEDLINE", "Wikipedia", "A personal blog"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed/MEDLINE is a comprehensive database that indexes a large number of biomedical journals, including those containing systematic reviews and meta-analyses."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is a key characteristic of a high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)?",
            "options": ["Lack of a control group.", "Blinding of participants and researchers.", "Subjective outcome measures.", "Small sample size."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Blinding helps to reduce bias in RCTs, ensuring that neither participants nor researchers know who is receiving the intervention or control."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "What does a 'p-value' of 0.05 in a research study typically indicate?",
            "options": ["The results are definitely due to chance.", "There is a 5% chance that the results are due to chance.", "The results are clinically significant.", "The sample size is too small."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.05 means that there is a 5% probability that the observed results are due to random chance if the null hypothesis is true."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the context of meta-analysis, what does 'heterogeneity' refer to?",
            "options": ["The similarity of study designs.", "The variability in the results across different studies.", "The use of homogeneous populations.", "The lack of statistical significance."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Heterogeneity refers to the degree of variability in the results of different studies included in a meta-analysis. High heterogeneity may indicate that the studies are too different to be combined meaningfully."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "A support specialist is using the ACCEPT framework. During the 'Assess' stage, what is the MOST important research-related activity?",
            "options": ["Implementing a new intervention immediately.", "Identifying validated assessment tools and understanding their psychometric properties.", "Relying solely on parent reports.", "Ignoring cultural factors in assessment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'Assess' stage requires using validated tools and understanding their psychometric properties to ensure accurate and reliable measurement."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "When 'Cultivating' a supportive environment, research suggests which approach is most effective for fostering social skills in autistic adolescents?",
            "options": ["Forced social interaction.", "Peer-mediated interventions with structured support.", "Completely isolating the adolescent to reduce anxiety.", "Ignoring the adolescent's sensory needs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peer-mediated interventions, supported by research, have shown to be effective in fostering social skills in autistic adolescents by utilizing the support of peers in a structured manner."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "In the 'Promote' stage of the ACCEPT framework, what is a crucial ethical consideration when disseminating research findings?",
            "options": ["Exaggerating the benefits of an intervention to secure funding.", "Presenting findings in a clear, unbiased, and accessible manner.", "Withholding negative results to maintain a positive image.", "Not disclosing potential conflicts of interest."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical dissemination involves presenting findings accurately and transparently to ensure informed decision-making."

            "options": ["Obtaining consent only from the parents, regardless of the child's capacity to understand.", "Ensuring that the child's assent is obtained, in addition to parental consent, if the child is capable of understanding.", "Assuming that parental consent automatically implies the child's agreement.", "Not providing any information about the study to avoid influencing the child's behavior."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires obtaining assent from the child, if capable, in addition to parental consent, to respect their autonomy and rights."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is the primary benefit of using systematic reviews and meta-analyses in neurodiversity support?",
            "options": ["They are quicker to read than individual studies.", "They provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence on a specific topic, reducing bias.", "They always confirm the effectiveness of interventions.", "They eliminate the need for clinical judgment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses synthesize evidence from multiple studies, reducing bias and providing a more reliable estimate of the effectiveness of interventions."
