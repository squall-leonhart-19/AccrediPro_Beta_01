            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate advanced sensory integration strategy for a client with tactile defensiveness who consistently refuses to wear socks, based on the case study of 'Client Anya'?",
            "options": [
                "Forcing the client to wear socks for increasingly longer periods each day.",
                "Implementing a sensory diet that includes activities involving deep pressure and proprioceptive input before attempting to put on socks.",
                "Ignoring the client's discomfort and focusing on other dressing skills.",
                "Providing a variety of brightly colored and patterned socks to make the experience more visually appealing."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study of 'Client Anya' highlighted the success of using a sensory diet incorporating deep pressure (like weighted blankets or firm hugs) before introducing potentially triggering tactile stimuli like socks. This helps to downregulate the nervous system and reduce tactile defensiveness."
