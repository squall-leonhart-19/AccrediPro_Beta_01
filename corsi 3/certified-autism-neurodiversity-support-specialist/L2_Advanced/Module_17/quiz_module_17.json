            "options": [
                "Immediately initiating exposure therapy to reduce avoidance behaviors.",
                "Providing Sarah with concrete, visual supports to understand the concept of death and grief.",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Autistic individuals often benefit from concrete explanations and visual aids when dealing with abstract concepts like death. This approach helps them process the information in a way that is more accessible and less overwhelming."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing attention for the absence of SIB (differential reinforcement of other behavior - DRO) and teaching alternative communication methods addresses the function of the behavior (attention-seeking) in a positive and proactive manner."
