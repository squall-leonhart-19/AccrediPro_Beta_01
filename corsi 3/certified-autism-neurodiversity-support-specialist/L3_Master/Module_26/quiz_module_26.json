            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical initial step in designing an effective program for neurodiverse individuals, aligning with the 'A' of the ACCEPT framework?",
            "options": ["Setting measurable goals", "Conducting a thorough needs assessment", "Developing a detailed curriculum", "Implementing positive reinforcement strategies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'A' in ACCEPT stands for 'Assess Needs'. A thorough needs assessment is fundamental to understanding the individual's strengths, challenges, and specific requirements, ensuring the program is tailored and effective."

            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A program developer is creating a social skills group for adolescents with autism. Considering principles of curriculum adaptation, which of the following modifications would BEST accommodate diverse learning styles?",
            "options": ["Using only verbal instructions to promote auditory processing", "Providing visual supports and hands-on activities", "Focusing exclusively on abstract concepts to enhance cognitive flexibility", "Avoiding structured routines to encourage spontaneity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Neurodiverse individuals often benefit from visual supports and hands-on activities. These adaptations cater to different learning styles and enhance comprehension and engagement. A 2021 study in the 'Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders' found that visual supports improved social skills learning by 30%."

            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the course, what percentage of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience co-occurring mental health conditions that should be considered during program development?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50-70%", "Approximately 90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies indicate that approximately 50-70% of individuals with ASD experience co-occurring mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD. Addressing these co-occurring conditions is crucial for holistic program development."

            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "When implementing the 'E' of ACCEPT (Effective Strategies) in a vocational training program for adults with ADHD, which strategy would be MOST beneficial for improving task completion and reducing impulsivity?",
            "options": ["Providing unstructured time for creative exploration", "Implementing a token economy system with immediate rewards for completing tasks", "Assigning large, complex projects with distant deadlines", "Discouraging the use of assistive technology to promote independence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'E' of ACCEPT emphasizes the use of evidence-based strategies. A token economy system provides immediate positive reinforcement for desired behaviors, which is highly effective for individuals with ADHD who often struggle with delayed gratification and task persistence. This aligns with principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)."

            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "Creating a supportive and inclusive environment involves which of the following key elements?",
            "options": ["Minimizing sensory input to reduce overstimulation", "Promoting understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity among all participants", "Focusing solely on skill deficits to accelerate progress", "Enforcing strict adherence to social norms and expectations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A supportive and inclusive environment prioritizes understanding, acceptance, and celebration of neurodiversity. This involves creating a culture of respect and valuing individual differences, rather than solely focusing on deficits or enforcing conformity."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "In the context of the 'P' of ACCEPT (Positive Reinforcement), what is the potential pitfall of using tangible rewards exclusively?",
            "options": ["Tangible rewards are always the most effective form of motivation", "Individuals may become reliant on external rewards and lose intrinsic motivation", "Tangible rewards are too difficult to implement consistently", "Tangible rewards are not suitable for individuals with intellectual disabilities"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While tangible rewards can be effective, over-reliance on them can undermine intrinsic motivation. It is important to gradually fade tangible rewards and incorporate more natural reinforcers, such as praise and a sense of accomplishment."

            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "Client Alex, a 10-year-old with autism, struggles with transitions between activities. To address this, his program incorporates visual schedules and pre-transition warnings. This strategy primarily aligns with which component of creating a supportive environment?",
            "options": ["Promoting social interaction", "Enhancing sensory regulation", "Providing predictability and structure", "Encouraging self-advocacy skills"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Visual schedules and pre-transition warnings enhance predictability and structure, which can significantly reduce anxiety and improve cooperation during transitions for individuals with autism who often benefit from routine and knowing what to expect."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "During program monitoring ('T' of ACCEPT), which of the following data collection methods would provide the MOST comprehensive understanding of a participant's progress in a social skills program?",
            "options": ["Administering a pre- and post-test questionnaire", "Observing the participant's interactions in natural settings and recording specific behaviors", "Reviewing attendance records", "Conducting weekly check-in meetings with the participant"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Direct observation in natural settings allows for the collection of objective data on the participant's social skills performance in real-world contexts. This provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of progress compared to self-report measures or attendance records alone."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important factor in ensuring the sustainability of a program designed for neurodiverse individuals?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While all options are important, securing long-term funding and resources is paramount for program sustainability. Without adequate financial support, the program may not be able to maintain its staff, materials, and services over time."

        {
            "id": "q26_10",
            "question": "A program evaluation reveals that participants are not generalizing skills learned in the program to their home environments. According to the principles discussed in the course, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Discontinue the program due to lack of effectiveness", "Increase the intensity of the program", "Modify the program to include strategies that promote generalization, such as incorporating real-world scenarios and involving family members", "Blame the participants for not applying the skills"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "If skills are not generalizing, the program needs to be adapted to specifically address this issue. This may involve incorporating real-world scenarios, providing opportunities for practice in different settings, and involving family members or caregivers in the intervention process."
