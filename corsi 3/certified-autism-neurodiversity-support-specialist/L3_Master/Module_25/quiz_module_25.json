            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The supervisor should first explore the underlying reasons for the supervisee's avoidance to address any potential biases, anxieties, or knowledge gaps, promoting self-awareness and professional development."

            "options": ["It provides objective data that is easy to track.", "It may overlook important qualitative aspects of supervisee development, such as ethical decision-making and cultural competence.", "It reduces the risk of supervisor bias.", "It is cost-effective and efficient."],
