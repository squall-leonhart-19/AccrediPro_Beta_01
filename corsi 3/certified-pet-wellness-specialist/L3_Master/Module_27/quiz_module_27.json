            "question": "An 11-year-old Golden Retriever, 'Buddy,' is exhibiting signs of cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation for Buddy's owner?",
            "options": ["Start Buddy on selegiline immediately.", "Recommend a complete geriatric blood panel and neurological exam.", "Suggest increasing Buddy's daily walks to stimulate mental activity.", "Advise the owner to accept that this is a normal part of aging and no intervention is necessary."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A complete geriatric blood panel and neurological exam are crucial to rule out other underlying medical conditions that may mimic or exacerbate CDS symptoms before initiating treatment. While selegiline is a common treatment, it's not the initial step without proper diagnostics."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A Border Collie competing in agility trials is experiencing muscle fatigue and decreased performance. Which nutritional supplement is MOST likely to benefit this working dog?",
            "options": ["Glucosamine and chondroitin", "L-carnitine", "Taurine", "Melatonin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "L-carnitine plays a vital role in energy production by transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria, which is essential for muscle function and endurance in working dogs. Studies have shown improved performance with L-carnitine supplementation in athletic animals."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "In a multi-cat household, what is the recommended minimum number of litter boxes to prevent stress and inappropriate elimination, according to the 'one per cat plus one' rule?",
            "options": ["One litter box for the entire household", "One litter box per cat", "One litter box per cat plus one", "Two litter boxes, regardless of the number of cats"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'one per cat plus one' rule helps ensure that each cat has ample access to a litter box, minimizing competition and stress, which can lead to behavioral issues like inappropriate elimination. This reduces inter-cat aggression related to resource guarding."

            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "A cat diagnosed with feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) is experiencing nausea and decreased appetite. Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Increasing protein intake to maintain muscle mass", "Restricting phosphorus intake to slow disease progression", "Adding sodium to stimulate thirst", "Supplementing with high levels of vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restricting phosphorus intake is a cornerstone of managing CKD in cats. High phosphorus levels can exacerbate kidney damage. While protein is important, it needs to be carefully managed in CKD to avoid increasing the kidneys' workload."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "What is the primary mechanism by which pheromone diffusers, like Feliway, are believed to reduce anxiety and stress in cats?",
            "options": ["By masking unpleasant odors", "By stimulating the release of endorphins", "By mimicking natural feline facial pheromones", "By directly affecting the cat's central nervous system"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Feliway and similar products mimic natural feline facial pheromones, which cats use to mark their territory as safe and secure. This can help reduce anxiety and stress in unfamiliar or challenging environments."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "A newly adopted dog from a local shelter is exhibiting signs of separation anxiety, including destructive chewing and excessive barking when left alone. What is the FIRST step in addressing this behavior?",
            "options": ["Punishing the dog for destructive behavior", "Flooding the dog with prolonged periods of isolation to get used to being alone", "Implementing a gradual desensitization and counterconditioning program", "Rehoming the dog to a family with someone always present"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gradual desensitization and counterconditioning are the recommended approaches for separation anxiety. This involves slowly increasing the dog's tolerance to being alone while associating positive experiences (e.g., treats) with the owner's departure."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Boxers are among the breeds most predisposed to DCM, a condition affecting the heart muscle. This genetic predisposition warrants proactive monitoring, including regular echocardiograms, and potentially dietary modifications like L-carnitine or taurine supplementation under veterinary guidance."

            "question": "A senior cat, 'Whiskers,' has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Besides medication, what dietary change is MOST likely to benefit Whiskers?",
            "options": ["Increasing fiber intake", "Feeding a high-iodine diet", "Feeding a low-iodine diet", "Supplementing with vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Hyperthyroidism in cats is often managed with a low-iodine diet to reduce thyroid hormone production. While medication is a primary treatment, dietary management can play a supportive role. High-iodine diets would exacerbate the condition."

            "question": "A client reports that their two dogs, a Labrador Retriever and a Chihuahua, are constantly fighting over food. What is the MOST effective strategy to manage this resource guarding behavior?",
            "options": ["Punishing the dogs when they fight", "Feeding the dogs in the same bowl to encourage sharing", "Separating the dogs during feeding and providing individual food bowls", "Removing food altogether and hand-feeding the dogs"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Separating the dogs during feeding and providing individual food bowls eliminates the competition for resources, which is the root cause of the fighting. This reduces stress and the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Punishment can increase anxiety and aggression."
