            "options": ["Online pet forums", "Peer-reviewed scientific journals", "Anecdotal evidence from pet owners", "Advertisements from pet food companies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peer-reviewed scientific journals undergo rigorous scrutiny by experts in the field, ensuring the information presented is of higher quality and reliability compared to other sources."

        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "Which database is specifically designed for biomedical literature and is an excellent resource for finding research on pet health and wellness?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed", "Wikipedia", "WebMD"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed is a comprehensive database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), containing millions of citations for biomedical literature."

        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in pet wellness research?",
            "options": ["To observe the natural behavior of pets in a controlled environment", "To establish a causal relationship between an intervention and an outcome", "To gather opinions from pet owners about their pets' health", "To describe the characteristics of a specific pet population"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs are designed to minimize bias and confounding variables, allowing researchers to determine whether an intervention directly causes a change in the outcome of interest."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "A study reports a p-value of 0.06 for a particular intervention. What does this p-value indicate?",
            "options": ["The intervention is highly effective.", "The intervention is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.", "There is a 6% chance that the observed results are due to random chance.", "The intervention has no effect on the outcome."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.06 exceeds the conventional significance level of 0.05, suggesting that the observed results are not statistically significant and could be due to random chance. Therefore, the intervention is not considered to have a statistically significant effect."

        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "What is a systematic review?",
            "options": ["A summary of opinions from experts in the field", "A comprehensive summary of all available studies on a specific research question", "A single research study conducted by a team of scientists", "An informal overview of a topic based on personal experience"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A systematic review uses a rigorous and transparent methodology to identify, select, and synthesize all relevant studies on a specific research question, aiming to provide an unbiased and comprehensive overview of the evidence."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Client 'Buddy,' a 7-year-old Labrador, presents with chronic osteoarthritis. Based on a meta-analysis showing that glucosamine and chondroitin supplementation reduced pain scores by 20% (95% CI: 15%-25%) compared to placebo, what would be the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Recommend surgery immediately", "Dismiss supplementation as ineffective", "Discuss glucosamine and chondroitin supplementation with the owner as a potential treatment option", "Prescribe a high dose of NSAIDs without further discussion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The meta-analysis suggests a statistically significant benefit of glucosamine and chondroitin supplementation. Discussing this option with the owner, along with potential risks and benefits, aligns with evidence-based practice."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is a common research gap in pet wellness?",
            "options": ["An overabundance of studies on canine nutrition", "A lack of research on the long-term effects of specific pet foods", "Extensive research on feline behavior", "Comprehensive studies on the effectiveness of all alternative therapies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While there is research on pet nutrition, the long-term effects of specific diets and ingredients often lack robust investigation, creating a research gap."

        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "What is the BEST way to stay current with new research and best practices in pet wellness?",

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A study on the effectiveness of acupuncture for pain management in cats had a sample size of only 15 cats. What is a potential limitation of this study?",
            "options": ["The study is guaranteed to be statistically significant.", "The small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings.", "The study is inherently biased because it involves cats.", "Acupuncture is always effective, regardless of sample size."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Small sample sizes can lead to reduced statistical power, making it difficult to detect true effects and limiting the extent to which the results can be generalized to a larger population."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A conflict of interest arises when a researcher's personal or financial relationships could compromise the objectivity and integrity of the research process, potentially leading to biased results."
