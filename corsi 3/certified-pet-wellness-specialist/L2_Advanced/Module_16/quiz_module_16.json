            "id": "q16_1",
            "question": "In the canine osteoarthritis case study, what was the primary reason for initially choosing a lower dose of NSAID, followed by gradual increase, instead of starting with a standard dose?",
            "options": ["To minimize potential gastrointestinal side effects.", "To assess the dog's pain tolerance.", "To reduce the overall cost of treatment.", "To avoid masking other underlying conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Starting with a lower dose and gradually increasing allows for monitoring of potential side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues, which are common with NSAID use in dogs."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "A cat diagnosed with stage 2 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) presents with mild dehydration and inappetence. According to the IRIS guidelines and holistic approach, which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Administer subcutaneous fluids and prescribe a phosphate binder.", "Start erythropoietin injections immediately.", "Begin a course of antibiotics to address potential infections.", "Recommend a renal diet and monitor urine specific gravity."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Subcutaneous fluids address dehydration, and phosphate binders help manage hyperphosphatemia, both common in CKD. A renal diet is also important, but addressing dehydration is paramount."

        {
            "id": "q16_3",
            "question": "In the canine anxiety case study, what specific behavioral modification technique was emphasized to help reduce separation anxiety?",
            "options": ["Flooding", "Counter-conditioning and desensitization", "Aversive training", "Punishment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Counter-conditioning and desensitization are positive reinforcement techniques used to change the dog's emotional response to being alone, reducing anxiety."

        {
            "id": "q16_4",
            "question": "A feline patient with diabetes mellitus is receiving twice-daily insulin injections. After a week, the owner reports persistent hyperglycemia and increased water consumption. What is the MOST important next step?",
            "options": ["Increase the insulin dosage by 50%.", "Switch to a different type of insulin.", "Perform a blood glucose curve to assess insulin effectiveness and duration.", "Add an oral hypoglycemic medication."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A blood glucose curve is crucial to determine if the insulin is working correctly, if the dosage is appropriate, and if the duration of action is sufficient. Dosage adjustments should be based on curve results."

        {
            "id": "q16_5",
            "question": "In the case study involving canine atopic dermatitis, what was the rationale behind incorporating omega-3 fatty acid supplementation into the treatment plan?",
            "options": ["To cure the underlying allergy.", "To directly suppress the immune system.", "To reduce inflammation and improve skin barrier function.", "To improve the palatability of the food."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and can help improve the skin's barrier function, reducing the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q16_6",
            "question": "A cat diagnosed with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is asymptomatic. An echocardiogram reveals mild left ventricular hypertrophy. What is the MOST appropriate initial management strategy?",
            "options": ["Administer a beta-blocker (e.g., atenolol).", "Start an ACE inhibitor (e.g., enalapril).", "Monitor regularly for clinical signs and echocardiographic changes.", "Prescribe a diuretic (e.g., furosemide)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In asymptomatic HCM, the primary focus is on regular monitoring for disease progression. Medications are typically initiated when clinical signs develop or significant changes are noted on echocardiogram."

        {
            "id": "q16_7",
            "question": "An 11-year-old Labrador Retriever presents with decreased appetite, reluctance to exercise, and urinary incontinence. Which of the following P.A.W.S. components is MOST relevant to initially address?",
            "options": ["Pain management", "Activity/Adaptations", "Weight management", "Social/Stimulation"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Decreased appetite and reluctance to exercise in a senior dog often indicate pain. Addressing pain is crucial before focusing on other aspects of wellness."

        {
            "id": "q16_8",
            "question": "In the ethical dilemma case study involving a client who cannot afford necessary treatment for their pet, what is an ethically sound approach a veterinary professional should take?",
            "options": ["Refuse treatment until full payment is received.", "Offer a payment plan, explore financial assistance options, and discuss alternative treatment strategies.", "Perform the treatment and send the client to collections if they cannot pay.", "Recommend euthanasia as the only viable option."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice involves exploring all possible avenues to provide care while respecting the client's financial constraints. This includes payment plans, financial aid options, and discussing alternative, potentially less expensive, treatments."

        {
            "id": "q16_9",
            "question": "A dog with osteoarthritis is prescribed carprofen. The owner is also giving glucosamine/chondroitin supplements. What potential interaction should the veterinary professional be MOST aware of?",
            "options": ["Increased risk of liver damage", "Increased risk of gastrointestinal upset", "Decreased effectiveness of carprofen", "Increased risk of kidney damage"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While glucosamine/chondroitin are generally safe, combining them with an NSAID like carprofen can increase the risk of gastrointestinal upset, particularly if the dog has a sensitive stomach."

        {
            "id": "q16_10",
            "question": "A cat with diabetes mellitus is being managed with insulin. The owner calls, concerned because the cat had a seizure. What immediate action should the owner be advised to take?",
            "options": ["Administer more insulin immediately.", "Give a small amount of corn syrup or honey orally.", "Induce vomiting.", "Wait and see if the seizure repeats."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A seizure in a diabetic cat could indicate hypoglycemia. Providing a small amount of sugar (corn syrup or honey) can help raise blood glucose levels quickly and potentially resolve the seizure. Veterinary attention is then needed urgently."
