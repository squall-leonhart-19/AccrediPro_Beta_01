            "question": "A canine patient presents with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Which of the following dietary modifications is MOST crucial to manage their condition, based on current veterinary guidelines?",
            "options": ["Increased protein intake to support muscle mass.", "Restricted phosphorus intake to slow disease progression.", "Increased sodium intake to encourage water consumption.", "High-fiber diet to promote regular bowel movements."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Restricting phosphorus intake is critical in managing CKD in dogs. Studies show that it can slow the progression of the disease and improve quality of life. While other options may have some benefits, phosphorus restriction is the most impactful."

            "question": "Which of the following feline enrichment strategies is MOST effective in reducing inter-cat aggression within a multi-cat household?",
            "options": ["Providing a single, large litter box for all cats.", "Offering multiple, elevated resting places and escape routes.", "Forcing cats to interact during playtime to establish dominance.", "Using pheromone diffusers in only one central location."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing multiple elevated resting places and escape routes allows cats to avoid conflict and reduces stress. Studies on feline behavior demonstrate that increased vertical space and escape options significantly decrease aggression in multi-cat households."

            "question": "A new technology utilizes liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze a canine patient's urine. What is the PRIMARY advantage of using LC-MS over traditional urinalysis methods?",
            "options": ["LC-MS is less expensive than traditional methods.", "LC-MS provides a more comprehensive analysis of metabolites and biomarkers.", "LC-MS can be performed by veterinary technicians without specialized training.", "LC-MS is significantly faster than traditional urinalysis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "LC-MS provides a more comprehensive analysis of metabolites and biomarkers, allowing for earlier and more accurate detection of diseases. This advanced technique can identify specific compounds that might be missed by traditional urinalysis methods."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "During a behavioral consultation, a dog owner describes their pet as exhibiting signs of separation anxiety, including destructive behavior and excessive vocalization when left alone. Which behavioral modification technique is generally considered the FIRST-LINE approach for addressing this issue?",
            "options": ["Flooding (exposing the dog to prolonged periods of isolation).", "Punishment-based training (using aversive stimuli to discourage unwanted behaviors).", "Systematic desensitization and counterconditioning.", "Administering anti-anxiety medication without behavioral therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Systematic desensitization and counterconditioning are the recommended first-line approach for separation anxiety. This involves gradually exposing the dog to periods of separation while associating those periods with positive experiences (e.g., treats, toys). Flooding and punishment are generally contraindicated, and medication should ideally be used in conjunction with behavioral therapy."

            "question": "An 11-year-old feline patient presents with decreased appetite, weight loss, and unkempt coat. Bloodwork reveals elevated creatinine and BUN levels. Which of the following age-related conditions is the MOST likely cause of these clinical signs?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism.", "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).", "Diabetes mellitus.", "Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated creatinine and BUN levels are indicative of impaired kidney function, making Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) the most likely diagnosis in a senior cat presenting with these signs. CKD is a common age-related condition in felines."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "Which of the following pain assessment tools is specifically designed and validated for use in cats?",
            "options": ["Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale – Short Form (CMPS-SF).", "Visual Analog Scale (VAS).", "Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).", "Feline Grimace Scale (FGS)."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The Feline Grimace Scale (FGS) is a validated tool specifically designed to assess pain in cats based on facial expressions. It assesses changes in ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whisker changes, and head position."

            "id": "q12_7",
            "question": "During a house fire, a dog inhales a significant amount of smoke. What is the MOST immediate and crucial step in providing first aid to this animal?",
            "options": ["Administering oxygen therapy.", "Inducing vomiting to remove any ingested toxins.", "Applying ice packs to reduce body temperature.", "Giving activated charcoal to absorb toxins."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Administering oxygen therapy is the most immediate and crucial step in treating smoke inhalation. Smoke inhalation can severely compromise respiratory function, and providing supplemental oxygen is essential to support oxygenation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing a detailed breakdown of the long-term health benefits and potential cost savings from preventing future health problems is the most effective way to address the client's concerns and promote compliance.

            "options": ["Positive reinforcement involves adding an aversive stimulus to decrease the likelihood of a behavior.", "Positive reinforcement is only effective when used in conjunction with punishment.", "Positive reinforcement involves adding a desirable stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior.", "Positive reinforcement is the same as bribery."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Positive reinforcement involves adding a desirable stimulus (e.g., treat, praise) after a behavior to increase the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future. It is a core principle of effective and humane training methods."
