            "options": ["Relying solely on visual observations to assess the pet's condition.", "Conducting a thorough physical examination, reviewing medical history, and utilizing diagnostic tools as needed.", "Ignoring subtle behavioral changes reported by the owner.", "Prescribing medication based on limited information."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

This is more comprehensive than relying on visual observation alone."

            "options": ["The plan should be generic and applicable to all pets of the same breed.", "The plan should be highly individualized and tailored to the pet's specific needs, lifestyle, and health status.", "The plan should prioritize cost-effectiveness over optimal health outcomes.", "The plan should be inflexible and strictly adhered to regardless of changing circumstances."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A successful wellness plan is personalized to the individual pet, taking into account their unique characteristics and requirements. Generic plans are unlikely to address specific needs effectively."
