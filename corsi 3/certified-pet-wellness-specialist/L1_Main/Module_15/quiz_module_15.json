            "question": "According to the lesson on canine nutrition, what percentage of a senior dog's diet should ideally be composed of protein to maintain muscle mass and support organ function?",
            "options": ["15-20%", "20-25%", "25-30%", "30-35%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Senior dogs require a higher protein intake (25-30%) to combat age-related muscle loss and support kidney function. A 2021 study in the Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition supports this recommendation."

            "question": "Which of the following feline behaviors is MOST indicative of redirected aggression?",
            "options": ["Hiding under furniture", "Excessive grooming", "Attacking a housemate after seeing an outdoor cat", "Urinating outside the litter box"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Redirected aggression occurs when a cat is aroused by a stimulus (e.g., an outdoor cat) and then directs its aggression towards another available target, such as a housemate. This is often immediate and intense."

            "question": "A client reports that their dog consistently tests positive for Giardia despite regular deworming with fenbendazole. What is the MOST appropriate next step in parasite control?",
            "options": ["Increase the dosage of fenbendazole", "Switch to a different dewormer with efficacy against Giardia, such as metronidazole or a combination drug", "Recommend more frequent deworming", "Advise the client to disinfect the environment with a quaternary ammonium compound"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Fenbendazole is not always effective against Giardia. Switching to a different medication known to treat Giardia, such as metronidazole or a combination product like Drontal Plus, is the most appropriate next step. Additionally, environmental disinfection is crucial."

            "options": ["Supragingival scaling", "Subgingival scaling", "Dental radiography", "Polishing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dental radiography is essential for diagnosing underlying dental issues below the gumline and requires specialized equipment and training to interpret effectively. A 2018 study in the Journal of Veterinary Dentistry highlighted that approximately 28% of dogs have dental issues only detectable via radiographs."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the P.A.W.S. Framework™, 'W' stands for Whole-istic Approach, emphasizing the importance of considering all aspects of the pet's life and well-being, including physical, emotional, and environmental factors."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The case studies highlighted the potential benefits of acupuncture, massage therapy, and herbal remedies in managing chronic pain in senior dogs, often used in combination with conventional treatments."

            "question": "A client is considering a raw food diet for their puppy. What is the MOST important ethical consideration to discuss with them?",
            "options": ["The potential cost savings compared to commercial diets", "The risk of bacterial contamination and nutritional imbalances", "The environmental impact of sourcing raw ingredients", "The palatability of raw food for puppies"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary ethical consideration when discussing raw food diets is the potential risk of bacterial contamination (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli) that can affect both the pet and human family members, as well as the risk of nutritional imbalances if the diet is not properly formulated by a veterinary nutritionist."

            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A cat is exhibiting inappropriate elimination (urinating outside the litter box). After ruling out medical causes, which behavioral modification technique is MOST likely to be effective?",
            "options": ["Punishing the cat when it eliminates outside the litter box", "Adding more litter boxes in different locations with different types of litter", "Restricting the cat's access to certain areas of the house", "Ignoring the behavior and hoping it resolves on its own"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Providing multiple, accessible litter boxes with different litter types can help address litter box aversion. Cats are fastidious and may have preferences for litter type, location, and cleanliness. Punishment is counterproductive and can worsen the problem."

            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "According to the lesson on advanced parasite control, what is the recommended frequency of fecal egg counts for adult dogs on year-round broad-spectrum parasite prevention in a low-risk environment?",
            "options": ["Every month", "Every 3 months", "Every 6-12 months", "Only if clinical signs of parasitism are present"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even with year-round prevention, fecal egg counts are recommended every 6-12 months to monitor for resistance or breakthrough infections. The Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC) recommends this frequency."

            "question": "In the case study involving the dog 'Buddy' with osteoarthritis, which integrative therapy was used in conjunction with NSAIDs to improve his mobility and reduce pain, ultimately allowing for a lower dose of NSAIDs?",
            "options": ["Chiropractic Adjustment", "Hydrotherapy", "Laser Therapy", "Acupuncture"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Acupuncture was successfully used in conjunction with NSAIDs in Buddy's case to manage his osteoarthritis pain, leading to improved mobility and a reduction in the required NSAID dosage. This illustrates the potential for integrative therapies to reduce reliance on pharmaceuticals."
