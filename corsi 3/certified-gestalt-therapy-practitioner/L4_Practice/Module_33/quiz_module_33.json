            "options": ["Prioritize the client's immediate needs above all else.", "Attempt to resolve the conflict in a responsible manner that avoids harm.", "Defer to the legal requirements of the jurisdiction.", "Consult with a more experienced therapist and follow their advice."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Immediately release the records to the court.", "Contact the client to discuss the subpoena and obtain their consent to release the records.", "Ignore the subpoena, as client confidentiality is paramount.", "Consult with an attorney to determine the legal requirements and client rights."],
