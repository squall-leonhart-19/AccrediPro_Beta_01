            "correctAnswer": 2,

            "options": ["Focusing on symptom reduction and behavioral modification.", "Maintaining a rigid therapeutic boundary to avoid manipulation.", "Emphasizing the relational field and the co-created experience between therapist and client.", "Adhering strictly to diagnostic criteria to guide treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy emphasizes the relational field and the co-created experience, recognizing that personality disorders often manifest in relational patterns. The therapeutic relationship becomes a key site for exploration and change."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy views resistance as a valuable source of information about the client's experience and needs, rather than as an obstacle to be overcome. Exploring resistance can lead to deeper understanding and facilitate change."

            "question": "What is 'boundary blurring' and why is it a concern for Gestalt therapists working with complex cases?",
            "options": ["It refers to the therapist's inability to clearly define the client's presenting problem; it is not a significant concern.", "It involves the therapist becoming overly involved in the client's life, potentially compromising objectivity and the therapeutic relationship.", "It describes the client's difficulty in distinguishing between their own feelings and the feelings of others; it is a core goal of Gestalt therapy to encourage this.", "It refers to the therapist using overly technical language, creating a barrier to communication."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boundary blurring occurs when the therapist becomes excessively involved in the client's life, which can compromise objectivity and the integrity of the therapeutic relationship. This is especially crucial in complex cases to maintain a healthy therapeutic frame."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques are essential in trauma-informed Gestalt therapy. Helping Sarah focus on her present sensory experience can bring her back to the present moment and regulate her emotional state during the flashback."
