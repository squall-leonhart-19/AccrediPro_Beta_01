        {
            "id": "q26_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical initial step in developing a Gestalt therapy program?",
            "options": ["Securing funding and resources", "Conducting a thorough needs assessment and identifying the target population", "Designing experiential activities", "Establishing ethical guidelines"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A needs assessment is paramount. It ensures the program addresses the specific needs of the intended population, preventing wasted resources and increasing effectiveness. L1 emphasizes this as the foundational step."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_2",
            "question": "A Gestalt therapy program aims to improve communication skills in young adults with social anxiety. Which experiential activity would be MOST effective in achieving this goal?",
            "options": ["Lectures on communication theory", "Role-playing scenarios involving challenging social interactions", "Individual journaling about social experiences", "Meditation exercises focused on reducing anxiety"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Role-playing directly engages participants in practicing communication skills in a safe, controlled environment, aligning with Gestalt therapy's emphasis on direct experience. L3 highlighted this as a potent technique."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in L6, which of the following is the MOST reliable method for measuring the effectiveness of a Gestalt therapy program focused on reducing anxiety?",
            "options": ["Participant self-reports alone", "Clinician observations alone", "A combination of standardized anxiety scales, behavioral observations, and participant self-reports", "Attendance rates at program sessions"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A multi-method approach, including standardized scales like the GAD-7, behavioral observations, and participant feedback, provides a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of program effectiveness. L6 detailed the importance of diverse data collection."
        },
        {
            "id": "q26_4",
            "question": "In the context of Gestalt therapy program development, 'unfinished business' refers to:",
            "options": ["Tasks that have not been completed by the program facilitator", "Past experiences or emotions that continue to affect a participant's present functioning", "Administrative tasks that remain outstanding", "Ethical dilemmas that have not been resolved"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Unfinished business, a core Gestalt concept, represents unresolved past experiences that impede present-day functioning. Addressing this is a key therapeutic goal. This concept was discussed across several lessons, especially L2 and L3."

        {
            "id": "q26_5",
            "question": "When adapting a Gestalt therapy program for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which modification is MOST crucial?",
            "options": ["Increasing the program's duration", "Using complex theoretical language", "Simplifying instructions and using concrete examples", "Eliminating experiential activities"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Simplifying instructions and using concrete examples is essential to ensure comprehension and participation for individuals with intellectual disabilities, as highlighted in L8. Abstract concepts should be avoided."

        {
            "id": "q26_6",
            "question": "A Gestalt therapy program facilitator observes that one participant consistently dominates group discussions. Which intervention is MOST appropriate from a Gestalt perspective?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior to avoid confrontation", "Directly confronting the participant in front of the group", "Privately inviting the participant to explore the underlying needs driving their behavior", "Removing the participant from the group"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy emphasizes awareness and exploration. Privately inviting the participant to explore their behavior allows for self-discovery and promotes personal responsibility. This aligns with the principles of L3 regarding group dynamics."

        {
            "id": "q26_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a process-oriented goal in a Gestalt therapy program?",
            "options": ["Reducing anxiety scores by 20%", "Increasing self-awareness and acceptance", "Improving communication skills", "Securing employment for participants"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Process-oriented goals focus on internal experiences and growth, such as increased self-awareness and acceptance, rather than specific behavioral outcomes. L2 emphasized the importance of focusing on 'how' rather than just 'what'."

        {
            "id": "q26_8",
            "question": "According to the ethical guidelines discussed in L5, what is the MOST important consideration when obtaining informed consent from participants in a Gestalt therapy program?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the consent form is lengthy and detailed", "Guaranteeing complete confidentiality, even in cases of potential harm to self or others", "Ensuring participants understand the nature of the program, potential risks, and their right to withdraw at any time", "Obtaining consent from a legal guardian, regardless of the participant's capacity to understand"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent requires participants to understand the program's nature, potential risks, and their right to withdraw. Complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed if there is a risk of harm. L5 stressed the importance of true understanding and voluntary participation."

        {
            "id": "q26_9",
            "question": "A small pilot study (n=25) of a new Gestalt therapy program showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in depression symptoms. However, the effect size (Cohen's d) was 0.2. How should these findings be interpreted?",
            "options": ["The program is highly effective and should be widely implemented.", "The program shows a small effect and further research with a larger sample is needed.", "The statistical significance invalidates the small effect size.", "The program is ineffective and should be discontinued."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While statistically significant, a Cohen's d of 0.2 indicates a small effect size. This suggests the program may have some benefit, but further research with a larger sample is needed to confirm its effectiveness. L6 discussed the importance of considering both statistical significance and effect size."

            "id": "q26_10",

            "options": ["Relying solely on grant funding", "Developing a diverse funding base and building strong community partnerships", "Minimizing program costs by using volunteer staff", "Avoiding program evaluation to save time and resources"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustainability requires a diverse funding base and strong community partnerships to ensure long-term viability. Relying solely on grant funding is risky, and avoiding evaluation hinders improvement. L7 emphasized the need for a multi-faceted approach to sustainability."
