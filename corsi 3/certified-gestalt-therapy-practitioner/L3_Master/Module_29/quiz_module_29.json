            "id": "q29_1",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, consistently interrupts and changes the subject when discussing her childhood. Using the FIELD Framework™, which element is MOST crucial to address FIRST?",
            "options": ["Examining Sarah's internalized 'shoulds' (Figure Formation)", "Exploring the relational context of the interruptions (Interpersonal)", "Identifying the somatic sensations associated with the interruptions (Experience)", "Analyzing the environmental factors triggering the interruptions (Dynamic)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Interpersonal dimension of the FIELD Framework™ emphasizes the relational context. Addressing the interruptions within the therapeutic relationship provides immediate insight into Sarah's interactional patterns before delving into intrapsychic or environmental factors."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "'Bracketing' involves setting aside your own preconceived notions to fully grasp the client's subjective reality. This allows for a deeper, more authentic understanding of their experience."

            "id": "q29_3",
            "question": "A client is experiencing anxiety and reports feeling 'stuck'. Which creative experiential technique is MOST appropriate to help them explore this feeling?",
            "options": ["Cognitive restructuring to challenge negative thoughts.", "A two-chair dialogue between the 'stuck' part and a 'free' part of themselves.", "Behavioral activation to increase engagement in enjoyable activities.", "Psychoeducation about anxiety management techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The two-chair dialogue is a classic Gestalt technique that allows clients to explore conflicting parts of themselves and integrate them into a more cohesive whole. This is particularly effective for addressing feelings of being 'stuck'."

            "id": "q29_4",
            "question": "What is the PRIMARY goal of therapeutic presence in advanced Gestalt practice?",
            "options": ["To maintain a neutral and objective stance to avoid transference.", "To fully embody the therapist's expertise and guide the client towards insight.", "To create a genuine and authentic connection with the client, fostering self-discovery.", "To strictly adhere to established therapeutic protocols to ensure effectiveness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Therapeutic presence emphasizes authenticity and connection, which facilitates the client's own exploration and growth. It's not about neutrality or rigid adherence to protocols."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Informed consent is crucial, especially with potentially evocative techniques. Clients need to be aware of the possible risks and benefits to make an informed decision about their participation. This aligns with APA's Ethical Principles of Beneficence and Nonmaleficence."

            "id": "q29_8",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of Gestalt therapy outcomes (Smith et al.) found a moderate effect size (d=0.65) for treating anxiety disorders compared to waitlist controls. How should this information be integrated into advanced practice?",

            "explanation": "Research findings should inform, not dictate, practice. Discussing the potential benefits and limitations of Gestalt therapy, while considering the client's unique circumstances, is essential for ethical and effective practice. A moderate effect size suggests potential benefit, but individual responses may vary."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging the client's feelings while maintaining professional boundaries is crucial. Exploring the underlying needs or patterns driving the attraction can provide valuable insight for the client. Termination may be necessary if the boundary violation cannot be addressed effectively, but it should not be the first step."

            "id": "q29_10",
            "question": "Client Mark, 45, presents with PTSD symptoms following a car accident. He reports feeling detached and numb. Which Gestalt technique is MOST suitable for initially addressing his dissociation?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding and body awareness techniques are crucial for addressing dissociation. Focusing on present moment sensations helps Mark reconnect with his body and the present, fostering a sense of safety and stability before engaging in more direct trauma processing. The other techniques could be overwhelming at this stage."
