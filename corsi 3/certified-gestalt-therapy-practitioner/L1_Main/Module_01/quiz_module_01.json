            "question": "In Gestalt therapy, what does 'figure' primarily refer to?",
            "options": ["The client's background and past experiences.", "The most salient need or concern in the present moment.", "The therapist's theoretical orientation.", "The therapeutic environment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'figure' represents the dominant need or concern that emerges into the client's awareness in the present moment, requiring attention and resolution."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is a core principle of the phenomenology of experience as it relates to Gestalt therapy?",
            "options": ["Interpreting unconscious motives.", "Focusing on the 'what' and 'how' of experience, not the 'why'.", "Analyzing past traumas.", "Developing cognitive restructuring techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapy emphasizes direct experience and observation of the 'what' and 'how' of a client's current experience, rather than delving into interpretations of underlying causes or past events. This is based on phenomenological principles."

        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A client reports feeling anxious but struggles to identify the specific source. Which Gestalt technique would be MOST helpful in clarifying the dominant figure?",
            "options": ["Dream analysis.", "Empty chair technique.", "Free association.", "Cognitive restructuring."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The empty chair technique can help the client externalize and explore different aspects of their anxiety, allowing them to bring the underlying figure into clearer awareness."

        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of an interruption to figure formation?",
            "options": ["Clear and direct communication.", "Effective problem-solving skills.", "Confluence, where boundaries become blurred.", "A strong sense of self-awareness."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confluence is an interruption to figure formation where the individual blurs the boundaries between themselves and others, making it difficult to distinguish their own needs and desires from those of others, thus hindering the clear emergence of a figure."

            "id": "q1_5",

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gestalt therapists prioritize creating a supportive environment for self-discovery through authentic engagement and presence, fostering client awareness and ownership of their experience. The therapist facilitates the client’s process rather than directing it."

            "id": "q1_6",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FIELD framework is a holistic approach in Gestalt therapy, where 'F' specifically represents 'Focus on Figure,' emphasizing the importance of attending to the client's most pressing needs and concerns in the present moment."

            "options": ["Introjection.", "Retroflection.", "Deflection.", "Egotism."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Introjection involves uncritically accepting others' beliefs and values, often leading individuals to prioritize external expectations over their own needs and desires, as seen in Sarah's case."

            "id": "q1_8",

            "options": ["Interpreting the client's unconscious motives.", "Encouraging the client to direct their actions outward instead of inward.", "Providing reassurance and support.", "Challenging the client's negative thoughts."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Retroflection involves turning actions onto oneself that were originally intended for others. A therapist should encourage the client to re-direct those actions externally to promote healthier expression and boundary setting."

            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Based on the case studies, which of the following is a common outcome when a client successfully clarifies their dominant figure in Gestalt therapy?",
            "options": ["Increased dependence on the therapist.", "Reduced anxiety and improved self-awareness.", "Suppression of uncomfortable emotions.", "Acceptance of fixed personality traits."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Case studies demonstrate that clarifying the dominant figure often leads to increased self-awareness, reduced anxiety, and a greater sense of agency as clients become more attuned to their needs and how to meet them."

            "options": ["Effective communication skills.", "A healthy sense of boundaries.", "Deflection as an interruption to figure formation.", "A strong ego boundary."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Changing the subject and avoiding eye contact are examples of deflection, a defense mechanism that interrupts figure formation by avoiding direct engagement with potentially uncomfortable or overwhelming material."
