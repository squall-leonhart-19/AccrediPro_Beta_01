            "question": "In Gestalt dream work, what is the primary goal of having the client 'become' different elements of the dream?",
            "options": ["To analyze Freudian symbols within the dream.", "To increase self-awareness by integrating disowned parts of the self.", "To predict future events based on dream imagery.", "To simply retell the dream narrative in vivid detail."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Gestalt dream work focuses on experiencing and integrating disowned aspects of the self, rather than symbolic interpretation or prediction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "Which body awareness technique is MOST directly aimed at helping clients differentiate between sensation, feeling, and interpretation?",
            "options": ["Progressive muscle relaxation.", "Sensory experiencing exercises.", "Biofeedback training.", "Guided visualization."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

        {
            "id": "q8_3",
            "question": "A client consistently presents as overly agreeable and avoids conflict. According to Gestalt principles of working with polarities, what might be a beneficial initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Encouraging them to always agree with others to build rapport.", "Exploring and acknowledging the 'aggressive' or 'assertive' side they might be disowning.", "Referring them for assertiveness training.", "Ignoring the pattern and focusing on other presenting problems."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
