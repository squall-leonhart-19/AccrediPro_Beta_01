            "question": "Which of the following best describes an impasse in Gestalt therapy?",
            "options": ["A fleeting moment of disagreement between therapist and client.", "A point where the client avoids full awareness and contact, hindering growth.", "A therapeutic technique used to challenge the client's core beliefs.", "A period of intense emotional expression during therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An impasse in Gestalt therapy is characterized by the client's avoidance of full awareness and contact, preventing them from experiencing and resolving unfinished business."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Introjection is the process of swallowing beliefs and values whole, without critical examination, and accepting them as one's own. This can hinder authentic self-expression."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "A client consistently blames their partner for their own feelings of inadequacy. This is MOST likely an example of which resistance to contact?",
            "options": ["Retroflection", "Confluence", "Projection", "Deflection"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable feelings, thoughts, or impulses to another person. In this case, the client is projecting their feelings of inadequacy onto their partner."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "Retroflection is characterized by:",
            "options": ["Blurring boundaries with others to avoid conflict.", "Turning back onto oneself what one would like to do to someone else.", "Distorting one's experience through intellectualization.", "Interrupting the flow of contact through humor or tangents."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Retroflection involves redirecting impulses or actions back onto oneself. Instead of expressing anger outwardly, for example, a person might turn it inward, leading to self-criticism or self-harm."

            "id": "q2_5",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Confluence is a blurring of boundaries where individuals avoid conflict by merging with the environment or others. This can lead to a loss of individuality and difficulty expressing unique needs."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Deflection is a way of avoiding direct contact by changing the subject, using humor, or speaking indirectly. It prevents genuine connection and keeps the individual at a safe distance."

            "options": ["Projection", "Retroflection", "Confluence", "Introjection"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the 'Sarah' case study, confluence was identified as the primary resistance. She blurred her boundaries with her husband to avoid conflict, leading to suppressed needs and resentment."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The use of humor to avoid discussing painful emotions is a classic example of deflection. It's a way of avoiding direct contact with difficult feelings."

            "options": ["Projection", "Retroflection", "Introjection", "Confluence"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The client is uncritically accepting their mother's belief about their worth. This is a clear example of introjection, where the client has 'swallowed' a belief without examination."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The goal when working with retroflection is to help the client redirect their feelings outward, allowing for healthier expression and resolution. This involves creating a safe and supportive environment for them to experiment with new behaviors."
