            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, scores high on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). What does this result primarily suggest?",
            "options": ["Sarah is definitely a narcissist.", "Sarah exhibits a higher-than-average level of narcissistic traits.", "Sarah is likely to be diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.", "Sarah is experiencing severe depression."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A high score on the NPI indicates a higher-than-average level of narcissistic traits, such as grandiosity, entitlement, and a need for admiration. It does not automatically equate to a diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While cognitive functioning is important generally, in the context of narcissistic abuse recovery, assessments typically focus on anxiety, depression, and attachment styles as common co-occurring conditions."

            "question": "According to the lesson, what is a primary limitation of relying solely on self-report measures when assessing survivors of narcissistic abuse?",
            "options": ["Self-report measures are always inaccurate.", "Survivors may minimize or distort their experiences due to shame, fear, or cognitive distortions.", "Self-report measures are too time-consuming.", "Self-report measures are only valid for individuals with high IQs."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Survivors of narcissistic abuse may minimize or distort their experiences due to shame, fear of judgment, cognitive distortions resulting from the abuse, or a lack of awareness of the full extent of the abuse. This highlights the need for a multi-faceted assessment approach."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A therapist uses the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) with a client who experienced narcissistic abuse. What is the primary goal of using this projective technique?",
            "options": ["To directly measure the client's level of narcissism.", "To uncover unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motivations related to the abuse.", "To diagnose the client with a specific personality disorder.", "To assess the client's current level of cognitive functioning."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Projective techniques like the TAT aim to uncover unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motivations by presenting ambiguous stimuli and asking the client to create a story or interpretation. This can reveal hidden aspects of their experience and emotional responses to the abuse."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of assessing self-esteem and self-efficacy in survivors of narcissistic abuse?",
            "options": ["To determine if the survivor is likely to develop Narcissistic Personality Disorder.", "To identify areas where the survivor's sense of self has been damaged and to inform interventions aimed at rebuilding confidence and empowerment.", "To predict the survivor's future financial success.", "To assess the survivor's ability to manipulate others."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Narcissistic abuse often significantly damages a survivor's self-esteem and self-efficacy. Assessing these areas helps identify specific deficits and guides the development of interventions to restore a healthy sense of self and empowerment."

            "options": ["Ignoring assessment results and focusing solely on the therapist's intuition.", "Using PTSD symptom scores to guide trauma-focused therapy techniques.", "Prescribing medication without conducting a thorough psychological assessment.", "Encouraging the survivor to confront their abuser directly without preparation."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating assessment data means using the information gathered from assessments to inform and tailor the treatment approach. For example, high PTSD symptom scores would indicate the need for trauma-focused therapy techniques."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "A client scores high on the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). What might this suggest in the context of narcissistic abuse recovery?",
            "options": ["The client is exaggerating their symptoms.", "The client may be using dissociation as a coping mechanism in response to trauma.", "The client is likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia.", "The client is resistant to therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Dissociation is a common coping mechanism used by survivors of trauma, including narcissistic abuse. A high score on the DES suggests that the client may be experiencing significant dissociative symptoms as a result of the abuse."

            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "Why is it important to continuously monitor a survivor's progress throughout the narcissistic abuse recovery process using assessment tools?",
            "options": ["To ensure the therapist is being paid adequately.", "To track the effectiveness of interventions, identify areas where progress is lacking, and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.", "To prove to the survivor that they are making progress, regardless of their actual experience.", "To gather data for research purposes only."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Continuous monitoring allows the therapist to track the effectiveness of interventions, identify areas where progress is lacking, and adjust the treatment plan to better meet the survivor's needs. This ensures that the therapy remains targeted and effective."
