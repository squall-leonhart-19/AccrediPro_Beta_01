            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Establishing a safe and respectful environment through a group agreement is paramount in trauma-informed care, as highlighted by the principles outlined by SAMHSA (2014). It directly addresses the core need for safety and predictability among trauma survivors."

            "options": ["Developing advanced conflict resolution skills", "Understanding the dynamics of narcissistic abuse and its impact on self-esteem and identity", "Learning techniques for assertive communication in professional settings", "Mastering mindfulness meditation techniques for stress reduction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of such a workshop is to equip participants with a deep understanding of narcissistic abuse dynamics and its effects. This foundational knowledge is crucial for their healing journey, as emphasized in Herman's (1992) work on trauma recovery."

            "id": "q34_3",
            "question": "Which facilitation technique is MOST effective in fostering group cohesion and engagement in a narcissistic abuse recovery group?",
            "options": ["Dominating the discussion to ensure all topics are covered", "Encouraging active listening and creating space for each member to share their experiences without interruption", "Focusing solely on providing psychoeducation and minimizing personal sharing", "Implementing strict rules about what can and cannot be discussed"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Creating a safe and supportive environment where members feel heard and understood is essential for group cohesion. Active listening and respectful sharing, as described by Yalom and Leszcz (2005), are key components of effective group therapy."

            "id": "q34_4",
            "question": "When adapting a narcissistic abuse recovery group program for diverse populations, what is the MOST important consideration?",
            "options": ["Ensuring all participants speak the same language", "Ignoring cultural differences to maintain a universal approach", "Acknowledging and addressing potential cultural differences in understanding abuse and seeking help", "Focusing solely on the common experiences of narcissistic abuse survivors"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cultural sensitivity is crucial when working with diverse populations. Ignoring cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and hinder the healing process.

            "question": "Which of the following actions would be considered an ETHICAL violation in a narcissistic abuse recovery group setting?",
            "options": ["Maintaining confidentiality of group members' disclosures", "Developing a clear informed consent process", "Engaging in a dual relationship with a group member outside of the group setting", "Providing psychoeducation about narcissistic personality disorder"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Dual relationships can compromise the facilitator's objectivity and exploit the vulnerability of group members. Ethical guidelines, as outlined by the APA (2017), strictly prohibit such relationships to protect clients from harm."

            "id": "q34_6",

            "options": ["Using sensational headlines and fear-based tactics", "Highlighting the workshop's potential to help participants 'win' against their abusers", "Emphasizing the workshop's focus on empowerment, healing, and understanding narcissistic abuse dynamics", "Promising a quick fix and guaranteed recovery"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Marketing materials should focus on hope, empowerment, and understanding. Sensationalism and unrealistic promises can be misleading and harmful to vulnerable individuals. A focus on evidence-based information and support is more ethical and effective."

        {
            "id": "q34_7",

            "options": ["Relying solely on anecdotal feedback from participants", "Using standardized pre- and post-tests to measure changes in self-esteem, anxiety, and depression", "Ignoring evaluation altogether to avoid potentially negative results", "Measuring only attendance rates to gauge popularity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Standardized assessments provide objective data on the impact of the intervention. Using pre- and post-tests allows for a more rigorous evaluation of changes in key outcomes, as recommended by research methodology guidelines (Creswell & Creswell, 2018)."

            "id": "q34_8",
            "question": "In a narcissistic abuse recovery group, a participant becomes highly reactive and triggered when another member shares a similar experience. What is the MOST appropriate facilitation technique to use?",
            "options": ["Immediately silencing the reactive participant to maintain group order", "Ignoring the reaction and continuing with the discussion", "Validating the reactive participant's feelings, offering support, and potentially suggesting a break from the discussion", "Focusing solely on the member who shared the triggering experience"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Acknowledging and validating the participant's feelings is crucial in managing trauma reactivity. Providing support and offering a break can help them regulate their emotions and prevent further escalation, aligning with trauma-informed care principles (van der Kolk, 2014)."

            "id": "q34_9",

            "options": ["Pressuring the member to share more details about their experiences", "Respecting the member's boundaries, creating a safe space, and gently encouraging participation without forcing it", "Ignoring the member's resistance and focusing on those who are more willing to share", "Publicly calling out the member's resistance as a form of denial"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Respecting boundaries and creating a safe space are essential for building trust and encouraging participation. Pressuring or shaming the member can be counterproductive and harmful. A gradual and supportive approach, as suggested by Corey et al. (2019), is more likely to be effective."

            "options": ["Encourage Sarah to immediately cut off all contact without hesitation.", "Discourage Sarah from making such a drastic decision and urge her to try harder to improve the relationship.", "Explore the potential benefits and challenges of this decision with Sarah, empowering her to make an informed choice while providing support regardless of her decision.", "Share your personal experiences with cutting off contact with a family member and advise Sarah based on your own outcome."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethically, it's crucial to empower Sarah to make her own informed decision. Exploring the pros and cons, providing support, and avoiding imposing your own beliefs or experiences is the most helpful approach. This aligns with the principles of client autonomy and informed consent."
