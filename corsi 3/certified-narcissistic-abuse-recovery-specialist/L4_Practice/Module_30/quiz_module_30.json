            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important reason for defining a specific niche in narcissistic abuse recovery?",
            "options": ["It simplifies your marketing efforts.", "It allows you to charge higher fees.", "It reduces the need for ongoing training.", "It guarantees a consistent client flow."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Defining a niche allows you to focus your marketing and become a recognized expert, increasing efficiency and attracting the right clients. While it can indirectly impact fees and training needs, the primary benefit is marketing focus."

            "id": "q30_2",
            "question": "According to best practices, how often should you ideally update your business plan during the first year of operation?",
            "options": ["Annually", "Bi-annually", "Quarterly", "Only if significant changes occur"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Updating your business plan quarterly during the first year allows you to adapt to market feedback and track progress effectively. The initial stages of a business require more frequent review and adjustments."

            "id": "q30_3",
            "question": "A client, 'Sarah,' discloses in a session that she is considering confronting her abuser physically. What is your ethical obligation in this situation?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to express her feelings in a safe manner.", "Report her to the authorities immediately.", "Advise her on self-defense techniques.", "Maintain confidentiality and continue the session as planned."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While maintaining confidentiality is crucial, you also have a duty to protect potential victims. Encouraging Sarah to express her feelings and explore safer coping mechanisms addresses both ethical obligations. Reporting her immediately might be premature, and advising on self-defense could enable harmful behavior."

            "id": "q30_4",
            "question": "Which marketing strategy is MOST likely to attract clients seeking narcissistic abuse recovery services?",
            "options": ["General mental health advertising.", "Targeted social media ads focusing on the effects of narcissistic abuse.", "Print advertisements in local newspapers.", "Sponsoring local sports teams."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Targeted social media ads, using relevant keywords and addressing the specific symptoms and experiences of narcissistic abuse survivors, are the most effective way to reach the intended audience. General advertising is less likely to resonate with this specific group."

            "id": "q30_5",
            "question": "What is the MOST critical aspect of financial management for a new private practice?",
            "options": ["Maximizing revenue through aggressive marketing.", "Maintaining accurate records of income and expenses.", "Investing in high-risk, high-reward opportunities.", "Minimizing expenses by cutting corners on essential services."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accurate record-keeping is fundamental for financial stability and compliance. While revenue generation is important, it cannot be prioritized over tracking income and expenses. This forms the basis for all other financial decisions."

        {
            "id": "q30_6",
            "question": "When setting up a telehealth practice, which of the following is MOST important to ensure client confidentiality and security?",
            "options": ["Using a free video conferencing platform.", "Ensuring your home internet connection is password-protected.", "Utilizing a HIPAA-compliant platform with encryption.", "Advising clients to use public Wi-Fi for sessions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "HIPAA compliance and encryption are essential for protecting client data during telehealth sessions. Free platforms often lack these security features, and using public Wi-Fi poses significant security risks."

            "id": "q30_7",
            "question": "During the initial client intake, what is the PRIMARY goal when assessing a potential client for narcissistic abuse recovery?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The primary goal is to understand the client's experiences and determine if narcissistic abuse is a relevant factor in their presenting issues. Diagnosing NPD is outside the scope of practice for a narcissistic abuse recovery specialist, and financial assessment and interventions come later."

            "options": ["A divorce lawyer.", "A psychiatrist for medication evaluation.", "A real estate agent.", "A personal trainer."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Severe anxiety and panic attacks may warrant medication management. Referring David to a psychiatrist ensures he receives a comprehensive assessment and appropriate treatment for his mental health symptoms. The other options are less directly relevant to his reported symptoms."

            "options": ["The system's aesthetic appeal.", "The system's compatibility with your EHR (Electronic Health Record) and insurance providers.", "The system's popularity among other therapists.", "The system's lowest possible monthly fee."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Compatibility with your EHR and insurance providers ensures seamless data transfer and efficient claim processing. While cost is a factor, it shouldn't outweigh the importance of functionality and integration."
