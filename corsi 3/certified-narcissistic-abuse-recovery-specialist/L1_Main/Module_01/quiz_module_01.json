            "options": [
                "An event that is inherently dangerous and life-threatening.",

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "C-PTSD arises from prolonged, repeated trauma, often within the context of interpersonal relationships. Narcissistic abuse fits this pattern due to the ongoing manipulation, control, and emotional invalidation that erodes the survivor's sense of self and security."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Grounding techniques are a crucial first step in managing emotional flashbacks. They help the survivor to reconnect with the present moment and regain a sense of control over their emotions and body sensations. Confronting the abuser or suppressing emotions would likely be counterproductive and potentially harmful."
