            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective advanced boundary-setting technique when dealing with a narcissistic individual who consistently violates personal space?",
            "options": ["Ignoring the behavior and hoping it stops.", "Politely asking them to stop each time it happens.", "Using a pre-planned, assertive statement outlining the boundary and consequences.", "Engaging in a debate to explain why the behavior is unacceptable."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A pre-planned, assertive statement with consequences is most effective because it is clear, direct, and provides a deterrent for future violations, minimizing emotional engagement which narcissistic individuals often thrive on."

            "id": "q13_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, reports feeling overwhelming anxiety whenever she anticipates seeing her narcissistic mother. Applying cognitive restructuring, which thought would be MOST helpful for Sarah to challenge?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The thought \"I can't handle the stress of seeing my mother\" is a catastrophic thought that amplifies anxiety. Challenging this thought and replacing it with a more balanced perspective is a key step in cognitive restructuring for self-empowerment."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive functions like emotional regulation and decision-making, is often impaired by chronic stress and trauma associated with narcissistic abuse.

Research by Neff (2003) supports the benefits of self-compassion in reducing psychological distress."
