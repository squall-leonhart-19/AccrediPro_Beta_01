            "question": "Which of the following is an example of an advanced boundary-setting technique that goes beyond basic assertiveness?",
            "options": ["Using 'I' statements.", "Setting time limits for interactions with a narcissistic individual.", "Employing the 'gray rock' method consistently.", "Avoiding all contact with the narcissistic individual."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'gray rock' method is an advanced technique that involves becoming as uninteresting and unresponsive as possible to avoid provoking a narcissistic individual. While 'I' statements and setting time limits are helpful, they are considered more basic assertiveness techniques. Avoiding all contact may not always be feasible or desirable."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, believes 'I am inherently unlovable.' Which cognitive restructuring technique would be MOST effective in challenging this core belief?",
            "options": ["Thought records.", "Downward arrow technique.", "Behavioral experiments.", "Socratic questioning."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Socratic questioning is most effective for challenging core beliefs. By asking a series of probing questions, the therapist helps Sarah examine the evidence for and against her belief, leading her to question its validity. The downward arrow technique helps uncover core beliefs, but Socratic questioning directly challenges them."

            "options": ["Cognitive reappraisal.", "Mindfulness meditation.", "Distraction.", "Opposite action."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Distraction involves shifting one's attention away from the distressing stimulus. Cognitive reappraisal involves changing the way one thinks about the situation. Mindfulness meditation involves observing emotions without judgment, and opposite action involves engaging in behaviors that are opposite to the emotion being experienced."

            "explanation": "The goal of re-parenting the inner child is to provide the nurturing and support that was missing in childhood, fostering healing and emotional growth. It is not about erasing the past, blaming parents, or creating a new personality, but about addressing unmet needs."
