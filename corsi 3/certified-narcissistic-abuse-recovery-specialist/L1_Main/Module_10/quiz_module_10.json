            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective advanced boundary setting strategy when dealing with a narcissistic individual who consistently violates previously established boundaries?",
            "options": ["Repeatedly explaining the boundary and its importance.", "Implementing immediate and consistent consequences for boundary violations.", "Ignoring minor boundary violations to avoid conflict.", "Relying on emotional appeals to elicit empathy."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Implementing immediate and consistent consequences is crucial.

A case study involving 'Client A' showed significant improvement in boundary adherence after implementing this strategy."
