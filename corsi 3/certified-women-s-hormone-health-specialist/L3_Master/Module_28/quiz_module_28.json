            "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with severe postpartum depression and expresses passive suicidal ideation. According to best practices, what is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Recommending St. John's Wort for mood elevation.", "Immediately referring her to a mental health professional for comprehensive evaluation and potential crisis intervention.", "Advising her to increase her exercise routine.", "Suggesting a support group for new mothers."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the severity of postpartum depression and suicidal ideation, immediate referral to a mental health professional is crucial for thorough assessment and intervention. Postpartum depression carries a suicide risk of up to 19% within the first year postpartum (WHO, 2023)."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "Which of the following laboratory values is MOST critical to assess FIRST in a patient presenting with acute onset anxiety, palpitations, and suspected hormonal imbalance?",
            "options": ["Estradiol (E2)", "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)", "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)", "Progesterone (Pg)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "TSH is crucial to assess first as thyroid dysfunction can mimic anxiety symptoms. Hyperthyroidism, for example, can manifest as anxiety, palpitations, and irritability, necessitating immediate evaluation."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Functional Mental Health should be prioritized to address the patient's anxiety, insomnia, and feelings of hopelessness, which are critical components in a crisis or complex case. As highlighted in the module, mental health comorbidities are common in women with hormonal imbalances."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Beneficence, the act of doing good and acting in the patient's best interest, is most relevant in this situation. It requires healthcare providers to take proactive steps to alleviate suffering and promote well-being, including immediate intervention for suicidal thoughts."

            "options": ["To restore fertility.", "To eliminate all symptoms of POI.", "To reduce the risk of long-term health consequences such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.", "To completely reverse the effects of ovarian failure."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary goal of HRT in POI is to mitigate the long-term health risks associated with estrogen deficiency, such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, as shown in a 2021 study by Webber et al. in The Lancet."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Instructing her to practice deep breathing exercises and grounding techniques is the most appropriate immediate action. While other options may be necessary, addressing the acute panic attack with immediate, accessible techniques is crucial for stabilization. A case study in the lesson highlighted the effectiveness of mindfulness techniques in managing acute anxiety symptoms."

            "id": "q28_9",
            "question": "A patient with severe PMS and PMDD experiences intense mood swings, including suicidal ideation, during the luteal phase. Which neurotransmitter is MOST likely implicated in these symptoms?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Serotonin is most likely implicated. Fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone levels during the luteal phase can affect serotonin neurotransmission, leading to mood swings and suicidal ideation in severe PMS/PMDD cases. Studies show that SSRIs are effective in managing PMDD symptoms by modulating serotonin levels."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Establishing a collaborative care model is crucial. Hormone-related mental health crises often require a multidisciplinary approach, involving mental health professionals, endocrinologists, and other specialists to address both the hormonal and psychological aspects of the patient's condition for sustained recovery. Neglecting the psychological aspects can lead to relapse, even with normalized hormone levels."
