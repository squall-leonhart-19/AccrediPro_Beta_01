            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Informed consent emphasizes client autonomy and understanding. Practitioners must ensure the client comprehends the information to make a voluntary decision. Option A is important, but client comprehension is paramount. A 2021 study in the Journal of Women's Health found that patient understanding significantly impacts treatment adherence."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires respecting client autonomy while providing accurate information and facilitating collaboration with other healthcare providers.

            "explanation": "Breaching confidentiality is permissible when there is a clear and imminent risk of harm to the client or others. Mandatory reporting laws often require such disclosures. Option D may be permissible with informed consent and IRB approval, but option C directly addresses safety."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Accepting a substantial gift can create a conflict of interest, potentially influencing your judgment and objectivity in the client's care.

            "explanation": "Beneficence, the principle of acting in the client's best interest, is challenged when a client demands a potentially harmful treatment.
