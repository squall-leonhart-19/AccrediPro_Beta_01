            "question": "A 38-year-old client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis presents with fatigue, weight gain, and irregular menstrual cycles. Initial lab results show elevated TPO antibodies and a slightly elevated TSH. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial step?",
            "options": ["Prescribe T4 medication immediately.", "Recommend a strict gluten-free diet and selenium supplementation.", "Order further testing including free T3, free T4, and reverse T3.", "Advise the client to monitor symptoms for 3 months before any intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While dietary changes and T4 medication may eventually be necessary, further testing is crucial to get a complete thyroid panel and understand the extent of the thyroid dysfunction."

            "question": "A 29-year-old client with PCOS is struggling with infertility and has elevated androgens. She is already following a low-glycemic diet. Which of the following supplements has the STRONGEST evidence for improving ovulation and reducing androgen levels in PCOS?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Inositol", "Omega-3 fatty acids", "Coenzyme Q10"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Multiple studies, including a 2018 meta-analysis in the *International Journal of Endocrinology*, demonstrate that inositol significantly improves insulin sensitivity, reduces androgen levels, and enhances ovulation in women with PCOS."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client reports increasingly heavy and painful periods. She suspects endometriosis but hasn't been formally diagnosed. What initial dietary recommendation is MOST likely to provide relief?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and kale contain compounds like DIM (diindolylmethane) that support the liver's detoxification of estrogen, potentially mitigating estrogen dominance often associated with endometriosis."

            "explanation": "While research is mixed, black cohosh has been shown in several studies to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in perimenopausal women, though its long-term safety requires consideration."

            "options": ["Adrenal Fatigue", "Post-Pill Syndrome", "Hypothyroidism", "Estrogen Dominance"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Post-Pill Syndrome is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, including fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety, that can emerge after discontinuing hormonal contraception, often due to hormonal shifts and nutrient depletions caused by the pill."

            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A 32-year-old client with a history of adrenal dysfunction is trying to conceive. Her cortisol levels are consistently low throughout the day. Which of the following interventions should be prioritized to optimize her fertility?",
            "options": ["High-intensity exercise", "Strict carbohydrate restriction", "Gentle stress reduction techniques and adaptogenic herbs", "Intermittent fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Gentle stress reduction techniques, such as meditation and yoga, combined with adaptogenic herbs like Rhodiola or Ashwagandha, can help support the HPA axis and improve cortisol production without further stressing the adrenal glands. Intermittent fasting and strict carb restriction can further dysregulate the HPA axis."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Even with normal TSH, T4, and T3 levels, elevated thyroid antibodies can increase the risk of miscarriage. Referral to an endocrinologist for consideration of low-dose thyroid medication (such as levothyroxine) may improve pregnancy outcomes."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Berberine and inositol are both effective in improving insulin sensitivity and have fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to metformin. They can be used as an alternative or adjunct therapy to manage insulin resistance in PCOS."
