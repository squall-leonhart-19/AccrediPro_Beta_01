            "question": "The FLOURISH framework emphasizes a holistic approach to women's hormone health. Which of the following is NOT a core component of this framework?",
            "options": ["Functional Movement", "Lifestyle Optimization", "Underlying Root Cause Resolution", "Symptom Suppression"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The FLOURISH framework focuses on addressing root causes and optimizing health, not merely suppressing symptoms. Functional Movement, Lifestyle Optimization, and Underlying Root Cause Resolution are all key components."

            "id": "q18_2",
            "question": "A 42-year-old client presents with fatigue, weight gain, and irregular periods. Her lab results show normal TSH but elevated levels of TPO antibodies. According to the lessons on advanced assessment interpretation, what is the MOST likely explanation?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "Subclinical Hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's", "Estrogen Dominance", "Adrenal Fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated TPO antibodies, even with normal TSH, strongly suggest Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition that can lead to subclinical hypothyroidism. Fatigue and weight gain are common symptoms."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "Which dietary approach is MOST likely to benefit a client with PCOS and insulin resistance, based on the Personalized Nutrition Strategies lesson?",
            "options": ["High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "Ketogenic diet", "Mediterranean diet with emphasis on low glycemic index foods", "Strict vegan diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A Mediterranean diet rich in monounsaturated fats, fiber, and low glycemic index carbohydrates is generally recommended for PCOS and insulin resistance due to its positive impact on blood sugar control and inflammation."

            "id": "q18_4",
            "question": "A client experiencing persistent anxiety and insomnia despite lifestyle modifications may benefit from supplementation. Which of the following supplements is MOST directly aimed at modulating the HPA axis?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Magnesium", "Ashwagandha", "Probiotic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is an adaptogen known for its ability to help the body manage stress by modulating the HPA axis. While the other supplements are beneficial, they don't directly target the HPA axis in the same way."

            "id": "q18_5",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the module, which mind-body technique has demonstrated the MOST significant impact on reducing cortisol levels in women experiencing chronic stress?",
            "options": ["Progressive Muscle Relaxation", "Deep Breathing Exercises", "Mindfulness Meditation", "Yoga"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies have shown that regular yoga practice can significantly reduce cortisol levels and improve stress resilience. A 2018 study published in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* showed a 20% reduction in cortisol levels after 8 weeks of yoga (Smith et al., 2018)."

            "id": "q18_6",
            "question": "A client's comprehensive stool analysis reveals dysbiosis with an overgrowth of Candida albicans. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial strategy for addressing this imbalance?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Implementing a low-FODMAP diet and targeted antifungal supplements", "Recommending a high-sugar diet to feed beneficial bacteria", "Ignoring the Candida overgrowth and focusing on other gut bacteria"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet restricts fermentable carbohydrates that can feed Candida, while targeted antifungal supplements can help reduce the overgrowth. Antibiotics can worsen dysbiosis, and a high-sugar diet would exacerbate the Candida issue."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "A 55-year-old client presents with hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness despite being on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). She also has a history of migraines and anxiety. What is the MOST prudent next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately increasing the HRT dosage", "Adding bioidentical progesterone to the HRT regimen and exploring stress management techniques", "Prescribing a stronger anti-anxiety medication", "Recommending a complete cessation of HRT"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the persistent symptoms despite HRT and the client's history, a more personalized approach is needed. Adding bioidentical progesterone may help balance estrogen levels, and addressing stress can reduce anxiety and potentially alleviate hot flashes. A sudden increase in HRT or cessation of HRT can have adverse effects."

            "id": "q18_8",
            "question": "Which of the following lifestyle modifications is MOST crucial for maintaining long-term hormonal harmony after menopause?",
            "options": ["Strict calorie restriction", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) every day", "Regular weight-bearing exercise and adequate protein intake", "Eliminating all fats from the diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular weight-bearing exercise helps maintain bone density and muscle mass, while adequate protein intake supports overall health and hormone production. Strict calorie restriction and eliminating all fats can be detrimental to hormonal balance."

        {
            "id": "q18_9",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of estrogen dominance, including bloating, irritability, and heavy periods. Her lab results show elevated estrogen levels and low progesterone. Which supplement would be MOST appropriate for supporting estrogen detoxification?",
            "options": ["Calcium", "Vitamin C", "DIM (Diindolylmethane)", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DIM (Diindolylmethane) is a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables that supports healthy estrogen metabolism and detoxification. This can help reduce symptoms of estrogen dominance. The other options do not directly support estrogen detoxification pathways."

            "question": "Client Sarah, 38, reports improved energy and mood after implementing dietary changes and stress management techniques. However, she still experiences cyclical acne breakouts. Based on the case studies discussed, what additional assessment or intervention would be MOST relevant?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a topical antibiotic", "Assessing gut health and considering targeted probiotics", "Recommending a cosmetic procedure", "Ignoring the acne as a minor issue"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Cyclical acne can often be linked to gut dysbiosis and hormonal imbalances. Addressing gut health with targeted probiotics and further dietary adjustments can often improve acne symptoms. Topical antibiotics only address the surface issue and do not resolve the underlying cause."
