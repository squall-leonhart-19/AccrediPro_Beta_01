            "question": "What is the primary goal of evidence-based practice (EBP) in women's hormone health?",
            "options": ["Relying solely on expert opinions.", "Integrating clinical expertise, patient values, and the best available research evidence.", "Following traditional treatment protocols without question.", "Implementing the newest treatment regardless of research support."],

            "question": "Which database is MOST likely to provide access to peer-reviewed articles focused on women's hormone health?",
            "options": ["Wikipedia", "PubMed", "WebMD", "Google"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed is a comprehensive database of biomedical literature, including peer-reviewed articles relevant to women's hormone health."

            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "What does a p-value of 0.03 generally indicate in hormone research?",
            "options": ["The results are not statistically significant.", "There is a 3% probability that the observed results are due to chance.", "The sample size is insufficient.", "The effect size is very large."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 indicates that there is a 3% chance that the observed results are due to random variation, suggesting statistical significance (typically p < 0.05)."

            "question": "A meta-analysis of lifestyle interventions for PCOS (n=500) showed a mean reduction in BMI of 2.5 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.2). What does the confidence interval suggest?",
            "options": ["The true mean reduction in BMI is likely outside the range of 1.8 to 3.2.", "The true mean reduction in BMI is likely between 1.8 and 3.2.", "The study is not statistically significant.", "The sample size is too small to draw conclusions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 95% confidence interval suggests that the true mean reduction in BMI in the population is likely to fall between 1.8 and 3.2."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "Which of the following study designs is considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of a supplement for hormone balance?",
            "options": ["Case study", "Observational study", "Randomized controlled trial (RCT)", "Expert opinion"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard because they minimize bias and allow for causal inferences about the intervention's effect."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Based on research discussed, which gut health intervention has shown promise in improving estrogen metabolism in women with estrogen dominance?",
            "options": ["High-sugar diet", "Antibiotic therapy", "Probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus strains", "Consumption of processed foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Probiotic supplementation, particularly with Lactobacillus strains, has been shown to improve estrogen metabolism by modulating the gut microbiome."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A study claims a new herbal remedy cures endometriosis with a 95% success rate, but the study only included 20 participants and lacks a control group. What is the MOST significant limitation of this research?",
            "options": ["The sample size is too small and lacks a control group, making it difficult to attribute the results to the intervention.", "Herbal remedies are inherently ineffective.", "Endometriosis is incurable.", "The success rate is too high to be believable."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The small sample size and lack of a control group make it difficult to determine if the observed effects are due to the herbal remedy or other factors. A control group helps account for the placebo effect and other confounding variables."

            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "A researcher receives funding from a supplement company to study the effects of their product on menopause symptoms. What ethical consideration is MOST important to address?",
            "options": ["Ensuring the study is published in a high-impact journal.", "Disclosing the funding source to avoid potential bias.", "Recruiting participants who are already taking the supplement.", "Promising positive results to the funding company."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Disclosing the funding source is crucial to transparency and allows readers to assess potential bias in the research findings."

            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 45, is experiencing perimenopausal symptoms. A recent observational study suggests that phytoestrogens can alleviate hot flashes. How should you, as an evidence-based practitioner, approach this information?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommend high doses of phytoestrogen supplements.", "Dismiss the study because it's observational, not an RCT.", "Critically evaluate the study's methodology, consider Sarah's individual needs and preferences, and discuss potential risks and benefits of phytoestrogens.", "Ignore the study and stick to conventional hormone replacement therapy."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An evidence-based approach involves critically evaluating the research, considering the client's individual circumstances, and discussing potential risks and benefits before making a recommendation."

            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "What is publication bias, and why is it a concern in hormone health research?",
            "options": ["The tendency for journals to only publish studies with statistically significant results, potentially overestimating the effectiveness of interventions.", "The tendency for researchers to only publish studies that confirm their own hypotheses.", "The tendency for journals to only publish studies funded by large pharmaceutical companies.", "The tendency for researchers to only publish studies with negative results."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Publication bias refers to the tendency for journals to favor publishing studies with statistically significant results, which can lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of interventions because studies with null or negative results are less likely to be published."
