            "question": "According to the lesson on advanced gut health strategies, which of the following prebiotics is MOST effective at increasing <span class=\"highlight\">Bifidobacteria</span> populations and reducing inflammation in women with hormonal imbalances?",
            "options": ["Inulin", "Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)", "Galactooligosaccharides (GOS)", "Resistant Starch"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) have demonstrated superior efficacy in modulating gut microbiota and reducing inflammation compared to other prebiotics, specifically benefiting women with hormonal imbalances by promoting Bifidobacteria growth, as discussed in the advanced gut health strategies lesson."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A 42-year-old client, Sarah, presents with persistent PMS symptoms despite lifestyle modifications. Her hormone profile reveals low progesterone and elevated estrogen. Based on the 'Optimizing Supplement Protocols' lesson, which supplement combination is MOST likely to provide targeted support for her specific hormone profile?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D and Calcium", "Magnesium and Vitamin B6", "DIM (Diindolylmethane) and Milk Thistle", "Iron and Folate"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "DIM supports healthy estrogen metabolism, while milk thistle aids in liver detoxification, crucial for balancing estrogen levels. This combination directly addresses Sarah's hormonal imbalance, offering targeted support beyond general nutrient supplementation."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding the long-term management of hormone health for women, according to the 'Prevention and Maintenance' lesson?",
            "options": ["Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the only effective long-term solution.", "Lifestyle modifications are ineffective once hormonal imbalances are established.", "Regular monitoring of hormone levels and personalized interventions are crucial for proactive management.", "Genetic predisposition is the sole determinant of long-term hormone health."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Prevention and Maintenance' lesson emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and personalized interventions, including lifestyle adjustments and targeted therapies, to proactively manage hormone health and mitigate potential imbalances over time. HRT is not the only solution, and lifestyle modifications are always beneficial."

            "question": "In the 'Advanced Case Study Analysis' lesson, the FLOURISH framework emphasizes which of the following as the MOST critical first step in assessing a client's hormone health?",
            "options": ["Ordering comprehensive hormone testing.", "Evaluating the client's financial resources.", "Establishing a strong therapeutic relationship and gathering a thorough health history.", "Implementing a restrictive diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The FLOURISH framework prioritizes building rapport and collecting detailed information about the client's history, lifestyle, and symptoms as the foundation for accurate assessment and personalized treatment planning. This approach ensures a holistic understanding of the client's needs before any interventions are implemented."

            "question": "According to the 'Role of the Liver in Hormone Detoxification' lesson, which phase of liver detoxification primarily involves conjugation, rendering hormones water-soluble for excretion?",
            "options": ["Phase 0", "Phase I", "Phase II", "Phase III"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification involves conjugation, a process where enzymes attach molecules (e.g., glucuronic acid, sulfate, glutathione) to hormones, making them water-soluble and facilitating their elimination from the body."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A client experiencing symptoms of adrenal fatigue also presents with low thyroid hormone levels. Based on the 'Addressing Adrenal Fatigue' lesson, what is the MOST appropriate initial strategy to support both adrenal and thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Immediately prescribing high doses of thyroid hormone.", "Focusing solely on thyroid support, as adrenal fatigue is not a recognized medical condition.", "Prioritizing adrenal support to stabilize cortisol levels, which can indirectly improve thyroid function.", "Recommending a ketogenic diet to improve energy levels."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The lesson on adrenal fatigue highlights the interconnectedness of the adrenal and thyroid glands. Supporting adrenal function first helps to normalize cortisol levels, which can then positively influence thyroid hormone production and utilization. Directly prescribing thyroid hormone without addressing adrenal function can exacerbate adrenal fatigue symptoms."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding the impact of chronic stress on hormone balance, according to the 'Adrenal Fatigue' lesson?",
            "options": ["Chronic stress has no significant impact on hormone balance.", "Chronic stress primarily affects male hormones, not female hormones.", "Chronic stress can disrupt the HPA axis, leading to imbalances in cortisol, sex hormones, and thyroid hormones.", "Chronic stress only affects hormone balance in individuals with pre-existing genetic predispositions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to dysregulation of cortisol, which in turn can impact the production and balance of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone) and thyroid hormones. This widespread disruption is a key feature of the stress response and its effects on hormone health."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the 'Advanced Strategies for Thyroid Health' lesson, which nutrient is MOST crucial for the conversion of T4 (inactive thyroid hormone) to T3 (active thyroid hormone) in peripheral tissues?",
            "options": ["Iron", "Selenium", "Vitamin D", "Zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Selenium is a critical component of the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase, which is responsible for converting T4 to the more active T3 form in peripheral tissues. Adequate selenium levels are essential for optimal thyroid hormone function."

            "question": "A 38-year-old client reports heavy, painful periods and has been diagnosed with endometriosis. Based on the 'Managing PMS and Menstrual Irregularities' lesson, which dietary modification is MOST likely to reduce inflammation and alleviate her symptoms?",
            "options": ["Increasing consumption of processed foods.", "Adopting a high-sugar diet.", "Following an anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants.", "Eliminating all carbohydrates."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An anti-inflammatory diet, rich in omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., from fatty fish, flaxseeds, chia seeds) and antioxidants (e.g., from fruits, vegetables), can help reduce inflammation associated with endometriosis and alleviate symptoms like pain and heavy bleeding. Processed foods and high-sugar diets exacerbate inflammation."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'Resilience and Stress Management' component of the FLOURISH framework specifically addresses the client's emotional and mental state, recognizing the bidirectional relationship between stress, psychological well-being, and hormonal balance. Addressing stress and building resilience are crucial for long-term hormone health."
