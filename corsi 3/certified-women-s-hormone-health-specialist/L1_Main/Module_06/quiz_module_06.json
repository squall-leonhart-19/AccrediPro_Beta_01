            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding individualized supplementation for hormone health?",
            "options": ["It is a one-size-fits-all approach based on general recommendations.", "It requires careful consideration of individual needs, symptoms, and lab results.", "It primarily focuses on high doses of a few key supplements.", "It disregards potential interactions with medications or pre-existing conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Individualized supplementation is tailored to the specific needs of each person, taking into account their unique hormonal profile, symptoms, and health history. This approach contrasts with generalized recommendations."

        {
            "id": "q6_2",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue, hair loss, and constipation. Lab results indicate low T3 and T4 levels. Which supplement would be MOST appropriate to initially consider supporting thyroid function?",
            "options": ["Vitamin D", "Magnesium", "Selenium", "Iron"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Selenium is crucial for the conversion of T4 to T3, the active form of thyroid hormone. Supplementation can support thyroid function in individuals with hypothyroidism. A 2021 study in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* supports this."

            "id": "q6_3",
            "question": "Which adaptogen is BEST known for its ability to reduce cortisol levels and improve stress resilience, particularly in women experiencing adrenal fatigue?",
            "options": ["Rhodiola Rosea", "Ashwagandha", "Ginseng", "Licorice Root"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha has been shown in multiple studies to reduce cortisol levels and improve the body's ability to cope with stress.  A 2019 meta-analysis in *Nutrients* highlighted its effectiveness in reducing stress and anxiety."

            "id": "q6_4",
            "question": "For a client with diagnosed PCOS and elevated androgens, which supplement has demonstrated the MOST evidence in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing testosterone levels?",
            "options": ["Vitamin B6", "Saw Palmetto", "Inositol", "Chasteberry"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Inositol, particularly myo-inositol, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce androgen levels in women with PCOS. A 2017 study in the *International Journal of Endocrinology* demonstrated significant improvements in these areas."

            "id": "q6_5",
            "question": "A 52-year-old woman experiencing hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness during perimenopause could benefit MOST from which of the following supplement combinations?",
            "options": ["Iron and Vitamin C", "Calcium and Vitamin D", "Black Cohosh and Magnesium", "St. John's Wort and Valerian Root"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Black cohosh is commonly used to alleviate menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, and magnesium can help with sleep and mood regulation during perimenopause. A 2010 Cochrane Review supports the use of black cohosh for menopausal symptoms."

            "id": "q6_6",
            "question": "When monitoring a client's progress on a new supplement protocol for hormonal balance, what is the MOST important factor to consider?",
            "options": ["The cost of the supplements.", "Subjective symptom improvement reported by the client.", "Changes in lab values and objective markers.", "The client's adherence to the protocol and any side effects experienced."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Client adherence and side effects are critical for successful supplementation. Without adherence, the protocol cannot be effective, and side effects may necessitate adjustments or discontinuation. Symptom improvement and lab value changes are also important, but adherence is the foundation."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin B6 is essential for liver detoxification pathways, including those involved in estrogen metabolism. Insufficient B6 can hinder proper estrogen clearance.
