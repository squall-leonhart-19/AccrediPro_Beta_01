            "question": "Which of the following dietary interventions is MOST likely to support a healthy gut microbiome and, subsequently, improve estrogen metabolism, particularly in reducing circulating levels of beta-glucuronidase?",
            "options": ["A diet high in processed foods and refined sugars.", "A diet rich in diverse plant fibers, fermented foods, and polyphenols.", "A diet primarily composed of animal protein and saturated fats.", "A diet severely restricting carbohydrates and focusing on fat intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A diet rich in diverse plant fibers, fermented foods, and polyphenols nourishes beneficial gut bacteria, promoting a balanced microbiome and reducing beta-glucuronidase activity, which can lead to improved estrogen detoxification."

            "question": "According to research discussed in the Personalized Supplementation Strategies lesson, what is the MOST effective timing strategy for supplementing magnesium bisglycinate to improve sleep quality and reduce nighttime cortisol levels?",
            "options": ["First thing in the morning on an empty stomach.", "Divided doses throughout the day.", "30-60 minutes before bedtime.", "Immediately after dinner."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supplementing magnesium bisglycinate 30-60 minutes before bedtime is most effective for improving sleep quality and reducing nighttime cortisol levels due to its calming effect on the nervous system."

            "question": "A client presents with symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and premenstrual mood swings. Considering the Neurotransmitter-Hormone Interactions discussed, which neurotransmitter imbalance is MOST likely contributing to these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Excessive dopamine levels.", "Low levels of GABA and serotonin.", "High levels of norepinephrine.", "Balanced levels of all neurotransmitters."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Low levels of GABA and serotonin are commonly associated with anxiety, insomnia, and mood swings, particularly in relation to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle."

            "question": "Which phase of liver detoxification does glutathione MOST directly support?",
            "options": ["Phase 0 (Uptake)", "Phase I (Activation)", "Phase II (Conjugation)", "Phase III (Elimination)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Glutathione is a critical antioxidant and cofactor in Phase II detoxification, where it conjugates with toxins to make them water-soluble for excretion."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the FLOURISH framework, 'O' stands for Overcoming Obstacles, which involves identifying and addressing barriers to hormonal health, such as stress, environmental toxins, and limiting beliefs."

            "question": "When interpreting advanced hormone lab results, what is the significance of assessing the ratio between 2-OH, 16-OH, and 4-OH estrogen metabolites?",
            "options": ["It indicates the overall estrogen production in the body.", "It reflects the efficiency of methylation pathways.", "It provides insight into estrogen detoxification pathways and potential cancer risk.", "It measures the levels of progesterone metabolites."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The ratio between 2-OH, 16-OH, and 4-OH estrogen metabolites provides valuable information about estrogen detoxification pathways and potential cancer risk, as imbalances can favor the formation of more harmful metabolites."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In Sarah's case, a comprehensive stool analysis revealed significant gut dysbiosis, which was contributing to inflammation and hormonal imbalances, ultimately explaining her persistent symptoms despite normal thyroid function tests."
