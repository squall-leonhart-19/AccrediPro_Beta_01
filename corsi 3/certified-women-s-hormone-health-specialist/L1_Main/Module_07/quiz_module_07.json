            "question": "Which of the following symptom clusters is MOST commonly associated with estrogen dominance?",
            "options": ["Hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness", "Irritability, bloating, breast tenderness, and heavy periods", "Fatigue, weight gain, and constipation", "Acne, hirsutism, and irregular cycles"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Irritability, bloating, breast tenderness, and heavy periods are classic signs of estrogen dominance. Hot flashes and vaginal dryness are linked to estrogen deficiency, while acne, hirsutism, and irregular cycles are more indicative of PCOS."

            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A 35-year-old client, Sarah, reports severe PMS symptoms including anxiety, depression, and difficulty concentrating in the week leading up to her period. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate as a first-line approach?",
            "options": ["Prescription of SSRIs", "Initiation of oral contraceptives", "Lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and stress reduction techniques", "Surgical removal of the ovaries"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Lifestyle modifications are generally the first-line approach for managing PMS. While SSRIs and oral contraceptives can be effective, they are typically considered after lifestyle changes have been explored. Surgical removal of the ovaries is a drastic measure and not appropriate for initial PMS management."

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to a 2023 meta-analysis, which of the following herbal remedies has shown the MOST promising results in alleviating hot flashes associated with perimenopause?",
            "options": ["Black cohosh", "Ginseng", "St. John's Wort", "Evening primrose oil"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "While several herbal remedies are used for hot flashes, black cohosh has the most research supporting its efficacy. A 2023 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) found black cohosh to be significantly more effective than placebo in reducing hot flash frequency and severity (p<0.01)."

            "question": "A client diagnosed with PCOS presents with insulin resistance. Which dietary approach is MOST likely to improve her symptoms?",
            "options": ["A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet", "A ketogenic diet", "A low-glycemic index diet", "A high-protein, high-fat diet"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-glycemic index diet helps to stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance, a key factor in managing PCOS symptoms. High-carbohydrate diets can worsen insulin resistance."

            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which of the following thyroid hormones is the MOST biologically active and exerts the greatest effect on cellular metabolism?",
            "options": ["T4 (thyroxine)", "T3 (triiodothyronine)", "Reverse T3 (rT3)", "Thyroglobulin"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "T3 is the most biologically active thyroid hormone, binding to thyroid hormone receptors in cells and influencing metabolic processes. T4 is a prohormone that is converted to T3. Reverse T3 is inactive."

            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "A client reports chronic fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Saliva testing reveals elevated cortisol levels in the evening. Which of the following stress management techniques is MOST appropriate to recommend?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT) in the evening", "Mindfulness meditation before bed", "Skipping meals to reduce metabolic stress", "Taking caffeine supplements for energy"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation before bed can help lower cortisol levels and improve sleep quality. HIIT in the evening can further elevate cortisol. Skipping meals and caffeine supplements can exacerbate adrenal dysregulation."

            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "Which of the following gut health interventions is MOST likely to improve estrogen metabolism and reduce the risk of estrogen dominance?",
            "options": ["Antibiotic therapy", "Probiotic supplementation", "A diet high in processed foods", "Limiting fiber intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Probiotic supplementation can support a healthy gut microbiome, which plays a role in estrogen metabolism through the <span class=\"highlight\">estrobolome</span>. Antibiotics can disrupt the microbiome. A diet high in processed foods is detrimental to gut health, and fiber supports healthy gut function."

            "question": "A 48-year-old woman experiencing perimenopause symptoms is struggling with insomnia. She has tried melatonin without success. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate next step in her symptom management plan?",
            "options": ["Increase the dosage of melatonin significantly", "Prescribe a benzodiazepine for sleep", "Assess and address potential underlying causes such as hormonal imbalances or stress, and consider other natural sleep aids like magnesium or valerian root", "Recommend she accept the insomnia as a normal part of aging"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing the underlying causes of insomnia, such as hormonal fluctuations or stress, is crucial. Natural sleep aids like magnesium or valerian root may be helpful. Increasing melatonin dosage or prescribing benzodiazepines without addressing the root cause is not ideal. Insomnia is not simply a normal part of aging and should be addressed."

            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "Case Study: Jane, a 29-year-old with PCOS, experiences irregular periods and acne. Her initial plan includes a low-GI diet and exercise. After 3 months, her periods remain irregular, but her acne has improved. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Discontinue the low-GI diet as it's not effective", "Add spearmint tea to the plan", "Recommend a high-intensity workout routine", "Prescribe oral contraceptives"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Spearmint tea has anti-androgenic properties and may help with hormonal imbalances contributing to irregular periods in PCOS. While the low-GI diet helped with acne, further interventions are needed for menstrual regularity. High-intensity exercise may exacerbate stress, and oral contraceptives should be considered after other options."

            "options": ["The latest trends in women's health", "The client's individual symptoms, medical history, lifestyle, and preferences", "The practitioner's personal beliefs about treatment", "The cost of the interventions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A personalized plan must be tailored to the individual client's unique needs and circumstances. While staying updated on trends is important, the client's specific situation should drive the plan. Practitioner beliefs and cost are secondary considerations."
