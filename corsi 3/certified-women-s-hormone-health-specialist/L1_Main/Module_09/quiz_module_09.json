            "question": "A 42-year-old client, Sarah, reports persistent fatigue, weight gain, and irregular periods. Her Foundation Assessment reveals low thyroid hormone levels and elevated cortisol. Which of the following lifestyle interventions should be prioritized initially based on the FLOURISH Framework™?",
            "options": ["Implementing a rigorous high-intensity exercise program.", "Introducing a strict ketogenic diet.", "Prioritizing sleep hygiene and stress management techniques.", "Recommending a comprehensive detoxification protocol."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the elevated cortisol levels, addressing sleep and stress is crucial before other lifestyle changes. Elevated cortisol can exacerbate hormonal imbalances."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Regular moderate-intensity exercise has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, a key factor in hormone balance. The meta-analysis showed a reduction in insulin resistance (p < 0.05)."
