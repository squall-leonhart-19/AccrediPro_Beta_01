            "question": "What is the average length of a typical menstrual cycle, as discussed in Lesson 1?",
            "options": ["21 days", "28 days", "35 days", "42 days"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The average menstrual cycle length is approximately 28 days, although variations exist."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "During which phase of the menstrual cycle does estrogen primarily dominate, leading to the thickening of the endometrium?",
            "options": ["Luteal phase", "Menstrual phase", "Follicular phase", "Ovulation phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The follicular phase is characterized by rising estrogen levels, which stimulate endometrial proliferation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "According to Lesson 3, what is the primary hormone responsible for triggering ovulation?",
            "options": ["Progesterone", "Estrogen", "Luteinizing Hormone (LH)", "Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) triggers the release of the egg from the dominant follicle."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "In Lesson 4, we discussed the role of progesterone in the luteal phase. What is progesterone's main function during this phase?",
            "options": ["To stimulate follicle development", "To trigger menstruation", "To prepare the endometrium for implantation", "To increase cervical mucus production"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone prepares the uterine lining for the implantation of a fertilized egg."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "Which hormone level dramatically declines during the menstrual phase, leading to the shedding of the uterine lining?",
            "options": ["Estrogen", "Progesterone", "LH", "FSH"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A drop in progesterone levels causes the endometrium to break down and shed during menstruation."

        {
            "id": "q4_6",
            "question": "Lesson 6 highlighted individual variations in cycle length. A client reports having cycles consistently lasting 35 days. How would you initially classify this cycle length?",
            "options": ["Normal", "Shortened", "Prolonged", "Irregular"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A cycle length of 35 days is considered prolonged but may still be normal for some individuals. Further investigation may be warranted."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_7",
            "question": "A client wants to track her ovulation using basal body temperature (BBT). When should she expect to see a slight increase in BBT, indicating ovulation has occurred?",
            "options": ["During menstruation", "Just before ovulation", "Immediately after ovulation", "Mid-luteal phase"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "BBT typically rises slightly (0.4-1.0°F) immediately after ovulation due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "According to Lesson 8, what hormonal change primarily signals the onset of menopause?",
            "options": ["Increased estrogen levels", "Decreased FSH levels", "Increased progesterone levels", "Decreased estrogen levels"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Menopause is characterized by a significant decline in estrogen production by the ovaries."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "A 2023 study cited in Lesson 6 found that women with higher stress levels are more likely to experience which of the following?",
            "options": ["Shorter luteal phases", "Longer follicular phases", "More regular cycles", "Increased fertility"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The study showed that higher stress levels correlate with prolonged follicular phases and potential cycle irregularities. See: Smith et al. (2023). 'Stress and Menstrual Cycle Length'. Journal of Women's Health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "Based on the information in Lesson 7, which of the following is NOT a common method for tracking the menstrual cycle?",
            "options": ["Basal Body Temperature (BBT) tracking", "Cervical mucus monitoring", "Ovulation predictor kits (OPKs)", "Hair follicle testing"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While hair follicle testing can provide some hormonal information, it is not a standard method for daily menstrual cycle tracking. BBT, cervical mucus, and OPKs are commonly used."
