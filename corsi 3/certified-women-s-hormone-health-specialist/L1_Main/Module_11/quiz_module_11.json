            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "Which of the following advanced gut health strategies is MOST likely to directly impact estrogen metabolism, according to recent research?",
            "options": ["Increasing insoluble fiber intake to 30g/day.", "Targeting specific probiotic strains known to modulate the estrobolome.", "Implementing a low-FODMAP diet for all patients.", "Prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics to eliminate dysbiosis."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Targeting specific probiotic strains that modulate the estrobolome directly affects estrogen metabolism by influencing the bacteria responsible for converting estrogens into forms that can be excreted or reabsorbed."

            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, presents with persistent bloating and irregular periods despite a healthy diet. Advanced lab testing reveals elevated beta-glucuronidase levels. Which supplementation strategy is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin D supplementation.", "Calcium-D-Glucarate to inhibit beta-glucuronidase activity.", "Iron supplementation to address potential anemia.", "Progesterone cream to regulate menstrual cycles."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated beta-glucuronidase indicates increased deconjugation of hormones in the gut. Calcium-D-Glucarate inhibits beta-glucuronidase, allowing for proper hormone excretion and reducing hormonal imbalances."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A 2022 meta-analysis showed that MBSR had the most significant impact on reducing cortisol levels compared to other mind-body practices due to its comprehensive approach to stress reduction."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In the case study of Maria, a 38-year-old with PCOS, advanced lab testing revealed elevated androgens and insulin resistance. Besides dietary changes, which supplement showed the most promise in improving insulin sensitivity, according to the case study?",
            "options": ["Omega-3 fatty acids", "N-acetylcysteine (NAC)", "Vitamin B12", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In Maria's case study, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was highlighted for its ability to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce androgen levels, addressing key aspects of PCOS."

            "question": "A client is experiencing persistent insomnia and anxiety related to hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause. Which supplement is MOST likely to improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety symptoms in this specific context?",
            "options": ["Melatonin", "Valerian Root", "GABA", "L-Theanine"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "GABA is a neurotransmitter that promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety, making it particularly effective for improving sleep quality and managing anxiety symptoms associated with hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause. It directly addresses the neurochemical imbalances contributing to these symptoms."
