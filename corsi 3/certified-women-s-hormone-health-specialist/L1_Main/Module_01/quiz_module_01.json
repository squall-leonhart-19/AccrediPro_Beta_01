            "id": "q1_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical first step in conducting a thorough Foundation Assessment for a woman presenting with hormonal imbalances?",
            "options": ["Ordering a comprehensive hormone panel", "Performing a detailed dietary analysis", "Conducting a comprehensive symptom assessment", "Reviewing the patient's family medical history"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A comprehensive symptom assessment provides the crucial foundation for understanding the patient's experience and guiding further investigation. As discussed in L2 and L3, symptoms are the starting point."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "According to research discussed in L4, what percentage of women experiencing chronic stress also report significant disruptions in their menstrual cycles?",
            "options": ["10-20%", "30-40%", "50-60%", "70-80%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies show that chronic stress significantly impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, leading to menstrual irregularities in a large percentage of women, approximately 70-80% as discussed in L4."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A 42-year-old client, Sarah, reports experiencing hot flashes, night sweats, and irregular periods. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism managed with levothyroxine. Which of the following medications should be carefully reviewed for potential interactions with hormone levels?",
            "options": ["Levothyroxine", "Vitamin D supplements", "Probiotics", "Over-the-counter pain relievers"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Levothyroxine dosage may need adjustment as hormonal changes related to perimenopause can impact thyroid hormone metabolism. A thorough medication review, as covered in L5, is crucial in such cases."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "When interpreting lab results, which of the following is the MOST important factor to consider alongside the numerical value of a hormone level?",
            "options": ["The patient's age", "The reference range provided by the lab", "The time of day the sample was collected", "The patient's reported symptoms"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While all options are relevant, the patient's symptoms provide context for interpreting lab values. As emphasized in L6 and L7, lab results should always be correlated with the clinical presentation to guide appropriate interventions."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "Which lifestyle factor has the MOST significant and direct impact on insulin sensitivity, potentially affecting other hormone levels?",
            "options": ["Sleep duration", "Physical activity", "Caffeine consumption", "Social interaction"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Regular physical activity directly improves insulin sensitivity, which has cascading effects on other hormones like cortisol, sex hormones, and thyroid hormones, as detailed in L4."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "According to the information covered in L7, what is the optimal time of the menstrual cycle to measure progesterone levels to confirm ovulation?",
            "options": ["Day 3-5", "Day 12-14", "Day 19-23", "Any day of the cycle"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Progesterone levels peak in the luteal phase, approximately 7 days after ovulation. Therefore, measuring progesterone on day 19-23 of a 28-day cycle provides the most accurate assessment of ovulation, as taught in L7."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "A client presents with symptoms suggestive of estrogen dominance. Which of the following lab tests would be MOST helpful in assessing estrogen metabolism and detoxification?",
            "options": ["Estradiol (E2)", "FSH and LH", "2:16 Hydroxyestrone Ratio", "Total Testosterone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 2:16 Hydroxyestrone ratio provides insights into how estrogen is being metabolized, specifically assessing the balance between beneficial and potentially problematic estrogen metabolites, a key concept in L6."
        },
        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "After completing the Foundation Assessment, you identify that a client’s primary hormonal imbalance appears to be related to chronic stress and adrenal dysregulation. Which of the following initial recommendations would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Immediate hormone replacement therapy", "Implementing stress-reduction techniques and adaptogenic herbs", "A restrictive elimination diet", "High-intensity interval training"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Addressing the root cause of the imbalance (chronic stress) with lifestyle modifications and supportive herbs is the most appropriate initial step before considering more invasive interventions, as discussed in L8."

        {
            "id": "q1_9",
            "question": "Which of the following statements regarding the use of DUTCH testing is MOST accurate, based on the information provided in the module?",
            "options": ["DUTCH testing is the gold standard for assessing all hormone levels.", "DUTCH testing provides a comprehensive assessment of adrenal hormone metabolites, offering insights beyond serum cortisol levels.", "DUTCH testing is only useful for women experiencing menopause.", "DUTCH testing cannot be used to assess estrogen metabolism."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "As described in L7, DUTCH testing offers a more complete picture of adrenal hormone production and metabolism compared to single-point serum cortisol measurements, providing valuable information for assessing stress response."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "A client's medical history includes PCOS, and she is currently taking metformin.

Which of the following is the MOST important next step in refining your assessment and recommendations?",
            "options": ["Immediately increasing the metformin dosage", "Recommending laser hair removal for hirsutism", "Investigating other potential contributing factors, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and gut health", "Prescribing a topical retinoid for acne"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While the other options may be considered, it's crucial to investigate underlying factors that may be contributing to the persistent symptoms despite metformin use. Addressing root causes, as emphasized in L8, is paramount for long-term success."
