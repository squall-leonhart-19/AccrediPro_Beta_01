            "id": "q4_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary benefit of using the COSMOS framework for milestone mapping?",
            "options": ["It only focuses on natal chart interpretation.", "It provides a structured approach for integrating various astrological techniques.", "It relies solely on traditional astrological methods.", "It disregards planetary transits."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The COSMOS framework helps astrologers systematically integrate diverse astrological techniques, offering a more comprehensive understanding of potential milestones."

            "id": "q4_2",
            "question": "According to the lessons, a transit of which planet is most likely to indicate a significant career milestone?",
            "options": ["Venus", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Mercury"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Jupiter transits, especially to key natal placements, are often associated with opportunities and advancement in career and public life."

            "id": "q4_3",
            "question": "If a client is experiencing challenges during a waning gibbous moon, which of the following is the MOST appropriate advice based on the principles discussed?",
            "options": ["Initiate a new project immediately.", "Focus on completion and releasing what no longer serves them.", "Ignore the lunar cycle and proceed as planned.", "Invest heavily in new ventures."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The waning gibbous phase is ideal for reflection, gratitude, and letting go of what is no longer beneficial before starting anew in the next lunar cycle."

        {
            "id": "q4_4",
            "question": "Which fixed star is traditionally associated with sudden fame or misfortune, and requires careful consideration when conjunct a personal planet?",
            "options": ["Sirius", "Regulus", "Algol", "Spica"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Algol is known for its potent and often challenging influence, associated with potential for dramatic events when conjunct personal planets."

            "id": "q4_5",
            "question": "What does it mean when a planet is considered 'out-of-bounds' in terms of declination?",
            "options": ["The planet is in retrograde motion.", "The planet's declination exceeds 23°27' North or South.", "The planet is in its detriment.", "The planet is in mutual reception with another planet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A planet is out-of-bounds when its declination exceeds the Earth's maximum axial tilt (23°27'), indicating unusual or unconventional expression."

            "id": "q4_6",

            "options": ["Juno conjunct her ascendant.", "Ceres in the 10th house.", "Pallas conjunct Mercury.", "Vesta in the 5th house."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "In the case study, Pallas conjunct Mercury was highlighted as a key factor, indicating strategic and creative thinking, crucial for Elena's writing success."

            "question": "When integrating multiple astrological techniques, what is the primary goal according to the lessons?",
            "options": ["To find contradictory information to confuse the client.", "To create a simplified, generic forecast.", "To identify consistent themes and patterns for a nuanced understanding.", "To prioritize one technique over all others."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The aim is to find overlapping themes and consistent patterns across different techniques to provide a comprehensive and insightful forecast."

        {
            "id": "q4_8",
            "question": "A client experiences a milestone that deviates significantly from the astrological forecast. What is the MOST important step to take in the iterative process?",
            "options": ["Blame the client for inaccurate reporting.", "Disregard the initial forecast and start over.", "Reflect on the factors that were missed and refine the astrological model.", "Assume the client is lying."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The iterative process emphasizes learning from deviations and refining the astrological model based on new information to improve future forecasts."

            "id": "q4_9",
            "question": "According to the material, which of the following best exemplifies using Lunar cycles to plan a business launch?",
            "options": ["Launching during the New Moon to capitalize on fresh starts and initiation.", "Launching during the Full Moon to capitalize on culmination and completion.", "Launching during the Waning Crescent Moon to capitalize on releasing old projects.", "Launching during the Waxing Gibbous Moon to capitalize on sharing information."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The New Moon is symbolically associated with new beginnings, making it ideal for launching new ventures."

            "id": "q4_10",
            "question": "A client has an out-of-bounds Mars. What might this suggest in terms of milestone mapping?",
            "options": ["A predictable and conventional approach to taking action.", "A highly structured and disciplined approach to achieving goals.", "An unconventional or rebellious approach to pursuing desires and taking action.", "A passive and withdrawn approach to pursuing goals."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Out-of-bounds planets often indicate unconventional expression; in Mars' case, this might mean a rebellious or unusual approach to asserting oneself and pursuing desires."
