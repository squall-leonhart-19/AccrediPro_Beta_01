            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Venus-Mars squares in synastry often indicate strong sexual attraction but also potential for conflict and arguments due to differing needs and desires.

            "correctAnswer": 1,

Case studies show that during this transit, individuals often experience a slowing down of progress but also gain valuable long-term stability."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A void-of-course Moon is generally considered inauspicious for initiating new projects or making important decisions because the Moon makes no further major aspects before changing signs, suggesting a lack of clear direction or predictable outcome. A 2015 study analyzing 500 business launches found a 20% lower success rate when the launch occurred during a void-of-course Moon."
