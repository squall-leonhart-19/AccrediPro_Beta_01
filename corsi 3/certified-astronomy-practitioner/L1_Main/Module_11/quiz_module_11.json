            "id": "q11_1",
            "question": "In advanced orbital observation, what is the primary benefit of precisely timing planetary transits?",
            "options": ["Determining a planet's color spectrum", "Refining the accuracy of ephemeris data and calculating orbital periods", "Predicting solar flares", "Identifying new constellations"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Precisely timing planetary transits allows for the refinement of ephemeris data, which directly improves the accuracy of orbital period calculations. As discussed in L1, even small timing errors can compound over time."

        {
            "id": "q11_2",
            "question": "According to the lesson on 'Stellar Strengths' (L2), which of the following is NOT a typical application of fixed stars in astrological practice?",
            "options": ["Highlighting inherent talents and strengths in a natal chart", "Identifying potential challenges or obstacles related to specific areas of life", "Predicting lottery numbers", "Adding nuance and depth to planetary interpretations"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Fixed stars are used to highlight talents, challenges, and add nuance to interpretations, but not for predicting lottery numbers. This would fall outside the bounds of ethical astrological practice."

            "id": "q11_3",
            "question": "In 'Refining Milestones' (L3), what specific lunar phase is traditionally associated with setting intentions and initiating new projects?",
            "options": ["Full Moon", "Waning Gibbous", "New Moon", "Last Quarter"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The New Moon is traditionally associated with new beginnings, intention setting, and initiating new projects. This is when the moon is conjunct the Sun, and its light is just beginning to grow."

            "options": ["Ignoring cultural differences to maintain a standardized approach", "Adopting only Western astrological techniques", "Acknowledging and respecting the diverse cultural interpretations of celestial events", "Dismissing the relevance of cultural traditions in astrological readings"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A culturally sensitive approach involves acknowledging and respecting diverse cultural interpretations of celestial events. This ensures that astrological practice is inclusive and avoids imposing a single cultural perspective."

            "id": "q11_5",
            "question": "In 'Optimizing Orbit' (L5), what is the primary goal of chart rectification?",
            "options": ["To determine the correct astrological software to use", "To identify the precise birth time for a more accurate astrological chart", "To predict future events with greater certainty", "To align the chart with the current planetary positions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chart rectification aims to determine the most accurate birth time, which is crucial for constructing a reliable astrological chart. This is done by aligning key life events with planetary transits and progressions."

            "options": ["Celestial Influences", "Outer World", "Soul's Purpose", "Mindset"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The 'Soul's Purpose' element of the COSMOS Framework directly addresses core values and life direction, making it the most relevant for helping Sarah identify what truly matters to her and overcome her feelings of stagnation."

            "options": ["Guaranteeing specific outcomes based on planetary positions", "Presenting information in a balanced and empowering way, focusing on potential growth", "Avoiding any discussion of challenging aspects", "Using fear-based tactics to motivate clients"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethically, it's crucial to present challenging aspects in a balanced and empowering way, focusing on potential growth and opportunities for positive change. This avoids creating unnecessary fear or anxiety."

            "options": ["0.25 degrees", "1 degree", "4 degrees", "10 degrees"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "A 1-minute error can shift the Ascendant by approximately 0.25 degrees. While this seems small, the cumulative effect can significantly alter house placements and planetary aspects, impacting the accuracy of the chart interpretation."
