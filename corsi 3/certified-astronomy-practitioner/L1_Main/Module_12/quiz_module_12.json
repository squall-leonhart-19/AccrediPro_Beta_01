            "question": "In applying the COSMOS framework, which element focuses primarily on understanding the client's external environment and its impact?",
            "options": ["Self", "Others", "Microcosm", "System"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'System' element of the COSMOS framework specifically addresses the client's external environment, societal influences, and systemic factors that affect their life and potential."

            "id": "q12_2",
            "question": "A client's chart shows a stellium in the 10th house, particularly strong in Capricorn. Based on the lessons, what potential career focus might be indicated?",
            "options": ["Creative arts with a focus on self-expression", "Leadership roles in established corporations or government", "Charitable work with a global impact", "Independent entrepreneurship in a tech startup"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A stellium in the 10th house, especially in Capricorn, often suggests a strong drive for achievement in established structures, indicating leadership roles or significant positions in corporations or government."

            "id": "q12_3",
            "question": "When observing complex cyclical patterns, what is the primary benefit of using harmonic charts in conjunction with traditional transits?",
            "options": ["To simplify the chart for easier interpretation", "To identify subtle themes and patterns that might be missed in the natal chart", "To predict specific dates of future events with greater accuracy", "To eliminate contradictory aspects in the natal chart"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Harmonic charts enhance pattern recognition, revealing underlying themes not immediately apparent in natal charts or standard transits. They do not eliminate contradictions or predict dates directly."

            "id": "q12_4",
            "question": "A client exhibits latent potential in communication but struggles with self-doubt. Which stellar strength amplification technique would be MOST effective initially?",
            "options": ["Progressed Sun conjunct natal Mercury", "Solar Return with Mercury in the 1st house", "Identifying positive Mercury aspects in the natal chart and focusing on activities that utilize them", "Ignoring the natal chart and focusing solely on transits"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting with natal chart strengths allows for building a foundation of confidence and demonstrable success, which can then be leveraged when examining progressed and solar return charts."

            "id": "q12_5",
            "question": "In creating achievable action plans, what is the significance of incorporating lunar cycles into the timeline?",
            "options": ["Lunar cycles have no practical impact on action plan effectiveness", "To align actions with natural rhythms and optimize energy levels", "To predict unexpected delays or obstacles", "To determine the most auspicious dates for financial investments"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Integrating lunar cycles acknowledges the ebb and flow of energy, allowing for strategic timing of actions to maximize effectiveness and reduce resistance."

            "id": "q12_6",
            "question": "When optimizing a client's 'orbit' by adapting to shifting celestial influences, which of the following is the LEAST helpful approach?",
            "options": ["Continuously monitoring transits and making immediate adjustments to plans", "Identifying long-term trends and making strategic, gradual adjustments", "Developing coping mechanisms for challenging transit periods", "Using fixed star conjunctions to identify potential opportunities"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Reacting impulsively to every transit can lead to instability and is not a sustainable approach. Strategic, long-term planning and developing coping mechanisms are more effective."

            "options": ["Encouraging Anya to completely disregard her family's opinions", "Helping Anya develop clear boundaries and communicate her needs effectively", "Advising Anya to abandon her entrepreneurial pursuits", "Suggesting Anya move to a different country to escape her family's influence"],
