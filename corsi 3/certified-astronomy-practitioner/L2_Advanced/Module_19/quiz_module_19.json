        {
            "id": "q19_1",
            "question": "Which of the following databases is MOST comprehensive for finding peer-reviewed articles related to astronomy and its therapeutic applications?",
            "options": ["Google Scholar", "PubMed", "PsycINFO", "Cochrane Library"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PubMed, while not exclusively focused on astronomy, indexes a vast collection of biomedical literature, including studies relevant to the psychological and physiological effects of astronomical interventions. Google Scholar is broad but less curated, PsycINFO is psychology-focused, and Cochrane Library focuses on systematic reviews."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'Boolean operator' in database searching?",
            "options": ["To filter results by publication date", "To combine or exclude keywords in a search query", "To identify the most cited articles", "To translate search terms into different languages"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) are used to refine search queries by specifying relationships between keywords, allowing you to broaden or narrow your search."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_3",
            "question": "In the context of critical appraisal, what does 'internal validity' primarily refer to?",
            "options": ["The generalizability of the study findings to other populations", "The accuracy of the statistical analysis", "The extent to which the study design minimizes bias and confounding variables", "The impact factor of the journal in which the study was published"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Internal validity refers to the degree to which a study demonstrates a causal relationship between the intervention and the outcome, free from the influence of extraneous factors."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of a meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["It involves the in-depth analysis of a single case study", "It statistically combines the results of multiple independent studies", "It focuses on qualitative data and thematic analysis", "It relies primarily on expert opinion and anecdotal evidence"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A meta-analysis is a quantitative approach that uses statistical methods to synthesize the results of multiple studies addressing the same research question, providing a more precise estimate of the effect size."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In case study research, what is 'triangulation' and why is it important?",
            "options": ["A statistical method for calculating sample size", "The use of multiple data sources or methods to enhance the credibility and validity of findings", "A technique for blinding participants to the intervention", "A type of experimental design"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Triangulation involves using multiple sources of information (e.g., interviews, observations, documents) or methods (e.g., qualitative and quantitative) to corroborate findings and reduce bias in case study research."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a commonly used tool for measuring subjective well-being in clients undergoing astronomical interventions?",
            "options": ["Electroencephalography (EEG)", "The World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)", "Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The WHO-5 is a widely used questionnaire that assesses various aspects of subjective well-being, making it suitable for tracking changes in clients' mental and emotional states during astronomical interventions. EEG, MRI, and GSR are physiological measures, less directly related to subjective well-being."

        {
            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "According to the C.O.S.M.O.S. framework, what does the 'S' stand for?",
            "options": ["Standardization", "Synthesis", "Specificity", "Sustainability"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the C.O.S.M.O.S. framework (Context, Observation, Synthesis, Measurement, Optimization, Sharing), 'S' stands for Synthesis, referring to the integration of evidence from various sources to inform clinical decision-making."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_8",
            "question": "When communicating research findings to a client, what is the MOST important principle to keep in mind?",
            "options": ["Using technical jargon to demonstrate expertise", "Presenting the information in a clear, understandable, and non-technical manner", "Emphasizing the limitations of the research to manage expectations", "Recommending specific interventions without discussing alternative options"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Effective communication with clients requires translating complex research findings into plain language, ensuring they understand the implications of the evidence for their individual situation and preferences."

        {
            "id": "q19_9",
            "question": "A study reports a p-value of 0.06. Using a significance level of α = 0.05, how should you interpret this result?",
            "options": ["The result is statistically significant.", "The result is not statistically significant.", "The result is clinically significant.", "The result is practically significant."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "With a p-value of 0.06, which is greater than the significance level (α = 0.05), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Therefore, the result is not statistically significant."
        },
        {
            "id": "q19_10",
            "question": "In a hypothetical case study, a 45-year-old client named Anya reports improved sleep quality and reduced anxiety after participating in a 6-week stargazing intervention. What type of data would BEST complement this self-reported outcome?",
            "options": ["A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on meditation", "Objective sleep data from a wearable sleep tracker and standardized anxiety assessment scores", "Expert opinions from experienced astronomers", "Anecdotal reports from other clients who have participated in similar interventions"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While other options might provide some context, objective sleep data (e.g., sleep duration, sleep efficiency) and standardized anxiety scores would provide quantifiable evidence to support Anya's self-reported improvements, enhancing the validity of the case study findings."
