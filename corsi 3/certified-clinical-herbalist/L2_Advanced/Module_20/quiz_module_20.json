            "question": "Which of the following is a primary benefit of using advanced intake questionnaires in herbal assessment?",
            "options": ["Reducing consultation time by eliminating client interaction.", "Gathering comprehensive and detailed information about the client's health history and current symptoms.", "Providing a standardized treatment protocol for all clients.", "Replacing the need for physical assessment techniques."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Advanced intake questionnaires allow for a structured and comprehensive collection of client information, enabling a more thorough understanding of their health status before or during the consultation."

            "question": "In physical assessment, palpation is used to primarily assess:",
            "options": ["The color of the skin.", "The temperature of the body.", "The texture, size, and consistency of tissues and organs.", "The clarity of lung sounds."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Palpation involves using touch to assess various physical characteristics of the body, providing valuable information about underlying structures."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "A client presents with fatigue, constipation, and dry skin. Laboratory testing reveals low T3 and T4 levels, but normal TSH. Which condition is MOST likely?",
            "options": ["Hyperthyroidism", "Primary Hypothyroidism", "Secondary Hypothyroidism", "Adrenal Fatigue"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Normal TSH with low T3 and T4 suggests the pituitary gland is functioning normally (ruling out primary hypothyroidism), but the thyroid gland is not producing enough hormone. This indicates secondary hypothyroidism, where the issue lies in the hypothalamus."

            "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of hair analysis for assessing nutritional deficiencies?",
            "options": ["Hair analysis can accurately measure nutrient levels in real-time.", "Hair analysis is not affected by external contaminants.", "Hair analysis is not a scientifically validated method for assessing nutritional status.", "Hair analysis can differentiate between nutrient deficiencies and toxic metal exposure."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While sometimes used, hair analysis lacks robust scientific validation and can be influenced by external factors, making it an unreliable method for assessing nutritional deficiencies."

            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Client Sarah, 45, reports bloating, gas, and fatigue after consuming wheat products. A food sensitivity test reveals a high IgG reaction to gluten. What is the MOST appropriate initial recommendation?",
            "options": ["Prescribe a high-dose probiotic supplement.", "Recommend a strict gluten-free diet for a trial period.", "Advise Sarah to ignore the test results as IgG reactions are normal.", "Suggest a blood test for celiac disease."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's symptoms and the IgG reaction, a trial gluten-free diet is a reasonable initial step to assess if gluten is contributing to her symptoms. Celiac testing is also warranted, but the dietary change is more immediate."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The MTHFR gene is involved in methylation, a crucial process for detoxification. Variations in this gene can impact a person's ability to process and eliminate toxins."
