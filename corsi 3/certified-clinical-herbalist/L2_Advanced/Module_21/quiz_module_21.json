            "options": ["Prescribing a single, potent herb targeting fatigue.", "Combining adaptogens for energy and digestive bitters for gut health.", "Focusing solely on symptomatic relief of digestive issues.", "Using only herbs with a strong laxative effect to cleanse the system."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "options": ["Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla).", "Ginger (Zingiber officinale).", "Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna).", "St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum)."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ginger, particularly in high doses, possesses antiplatelet properties and can potentiate the effects of Warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. St. John's Wort is also a strong CYP3A4 inducer and should be avoided."
