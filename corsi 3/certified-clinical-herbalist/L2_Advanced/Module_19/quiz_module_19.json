            "question": "Which of the following databases is specifically designed for researching traditional medicine and herbal therapies?",
            "options": ["PubMed", "Cochrane Library", "AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database)", "Scopus"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "AMED focuses specifically on complementary and alternative medicine, including herbal therapies. PubMed and Scopus are broader in scope, while Cochrane Library focuses on systematic reviews."

            "id": "q19_2",
            "question": "A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is considered a gold standard in research due to its ability to:",
            "options": ["Eliminate all bias in the study.", "Establish causation between an intervention and an outcome.", "Guarantee statistical significance.", "Be easily replicated in any setting."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "RCTs, through randomization and control groups, aim to establish a causal link by minimizing confounding variables. They do not eliminate all bias, guarantee significance, or ensure easy replication."

            "question": "What is a 'forest plot' primarily used for in meta-analysis?",
            "options": ["To visualize the distribution of study participants by age.", "To display the individual and combined results of multiple studies.", "To illustrate the geographical locations where the studies were conducted.", "To show the correlation between different herbal compounds."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Forest plots visually represent the effect sizes and confidence intervals of individual studies, along with the pooled effect size from the meta-analysis."

            "id": "q19_4",
            "question": "In evidence-informed herbal practice, what is the role of patient preference?",
            "options": ["It should be disregarded if it conflicts with the strongest evidence.", "It should be the primary factor in treatment decisions.", "It should be integrated with clinical expertise and research evidence.", "It is only relevant in palliative care settings."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Evidence-informed practice emphasizes integrating patient values and preferences with the best available evidence and the practitioner's clinical expertise to make shared decisions."

            "options": ["In vitro studies on cell lines", "Animal studies (in vivo)", "Human clinical trials", "Astrological compatibility assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Safety and toxicity assessments typically involve laboratory studies, animal models, and human trials. Astrological compatibility is not a scientifically recognized method."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "What is 'publication bias' in herbal research?",
            "options": ["The tendency to only publish studies with positive results.", "The requirement to publish all herbal research in English.", "The preference for publishing studies funded by large corporations.", "The bias towards publishing research from specific geographical regions."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Publication bias refers to the tendency for studies with statistically significant or positive results to be more likely to be published than studies with negative or inconclusive results, potentially skewing the overall evidence base."

            "options": ["Ginseng", "St. John's Wort", "Valerian root", "Echinacea"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Valerian root has demonstrated efficacy in multiple studies for mild anxiety and insomnia, often with fewer side effects than pharmaceutical options. St. John's Wort is typically used for depression, and Ginseng and Echinacea have different primary uses."

            "question": "A researcher is conducting a study on a traditional herbal formula. What is the most ethical approach to sourcing the herbs?",
            "options": ["Harvesting the herbs from a protected natural reserve without permission.", "Purchasing the herbs from the cheapest supplier available, regardless of sustainability practices.", "Ensuring the herbs are sustainably sourced and ethically harvested, respecting local communities and biodiversity.", "Using synthetic substitutes to reduce costs and environmental impact."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ethical sourcing involves respecting local communities, ensuring fair trade practices, and minimizing environmental impact through sustainable harvesting methods."

            "options": ["Replacing herbal remedies with synthetic pharmaceuticals", "Ignoring traditional knowledge in favor of modern scientific methods", "Personalized herbal medicine based on individual genetic profiles", "Decreasing the use of herbal medicine due to safety concerns"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Personalized medicine, including tailoring herbal treatments to individual genetic variations and metabolic profiles, is an emerging area of focus in herbal research."
