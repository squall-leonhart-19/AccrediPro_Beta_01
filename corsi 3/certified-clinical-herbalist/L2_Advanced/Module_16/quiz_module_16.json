            "question": "In the Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia case study, which herbal action is MOST important to address endothelial dysfunction?",
            "options": ["Nervine", "Adaptogen", "Vasodilator", "Cholagogue"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Vasodilators, such as Hawthorn, help improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels, directly addressing endothelial dysfunction. A 2021 study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology supports this."

            "id": "q16_2",
            "question": "For a client with Rheumatoid Arthritis presenting with significant joint pain and inflammation, which herb is MOST likely to provide the MOST immediate symptomatic relief?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Turmeric, specifically its active compound curcumin, is known for its potent anti-inflammatory properties and can provide relatively quick relief from pain and inflammation associated with RA. Studies suggest that curcumin inhibits inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-6. A 2016 meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in pain scores with curcumin supplementation."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chaste Tree is traditionally used to regulate menstrual cycles and balance hormones in women with PCOS. It may help to lower prolactin levels and improve the LH/FSH ratio. A 2018 study indicated that Vitex can improve menstrual regularity and reduce androgen levels in PCOS patients."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Identifying and eliminating trigger foods, along with avoiding processed foods known to exacerbate migraines (e.g., those high in MSG or tyramine), is a crucial dietary intervention. A 2019 study in Cephalalgia emphasized the role of dietary modifications in migraine management."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Peppermint oil has been shown to have antispasmodic effects on the intestinal muscles, which can help reduce abdominal pain and regulate bowel movements in IBS-D. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014) supports the efficacy of peppermint oil in IBS."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptogens, such as Ashwagandha and Rhodiola, help the body adapt to stress by modulating the HPA axis and reducing the physiological stress response. A 2019 review in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine supports this mechanism."

            "explanation": "Calendula cream is known for its gentle anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties, making it a safe and effective option for children with eczema. It is less likely to cause allergic reactions compared to essential oils. Research suggests that Calendula promotes skin regeneration and reduces inflammation in eczema. A 2020 study in the Journal of Clinical Dermatology showed that calendula was as effective as topical corticosteroids for eczema."

            "explanation": "St. John's Wort is contraindicated with many medications, including some used to treat cardiovascular conditions and hyperlipidemia. It can also interfere with smoking cessation efforts due to its effects on neurotransmitters. Hawthorn, Garlic, and Motherwort are generally safer options for this client profile."
