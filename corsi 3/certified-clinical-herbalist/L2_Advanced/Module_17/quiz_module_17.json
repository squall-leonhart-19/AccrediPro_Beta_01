            "question": "A client taking warfarin presents with a request for herbal support. Which herb is MOST likely to pose a significant interaction risk?",
            "options": ["Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)", "Ginger (Zingiber officinale)", "Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba)", "Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ginkgo biloba has antiplatelet activity and can potentiate the effects of warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. A 2018 study in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis highlighted this interaction."
        },
        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In a client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which herbal action is GENERALLY most appropriate to support immune modulation?",
            "options": ["Strong immunostimulation", "Adaptive immune regulation", "Direct cytotoxic action", "Immediate anti-inflammatory effect"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptive immune regulation, using herbs like Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), aims to balance the immune response without excessive stimulation, which can exacerbate autoimmune conditions. A 2021 meta-analysis in 'Autoimmunity Reviews' supports this approach."

            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client with mild to moderate depression is already taking a low dose SSRI. Which herb requires the MOST caution due to potential for serotonin syndrome?",
            "options": ["St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum)", "Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea)", "Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)", "Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort has significant serotonergic activity and can interact with SSRIs, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome. Co-administration requires careful monitoring and is often contraindicated. A 2019 review in 'CNS Drugs' emphasizes this risk."

            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "Which of the following herbs is LEAST likely to be contraindicated in a client with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer who is currently undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy?",
            "options": ["Black Cohosh (Actaea racemosa)", "Red Clover (Trifolium pratense)", "Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis)", "Turmeric (Curcuma longa)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While some studies show conflicting data, Turmeric is generally considered safer than herbs with known estrogenic effects like Black Cohosh, Red Clover, and Dong Quai in estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer cases. However, high doses should still be approached with caution. A 2022 review in 'Integrative Cancer Therapies' discusses the complexities of phytoestrogens and breast cancer."

            "options": ["Strong stimulant laxatives and adaptogens", "Demulcent herbs, carminatives, and nervines", "Astringent herbs and diuretics", "Immune-stimulating herbs and antibiotics"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Demulcent herbs soothe the GI tract, carminatives reduce gas and bloating, and nervines address the anxiety component often associated with IBS. This combination addresses multiple facets of the condition. A 2020 clinical trial in 'Phytotherapy Research' showed the effectiveness of this approach."

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Combining herbal diuretics with pharmaceutical diuretics can lead to dangerous electrolyte imbalances, especially potassium depletion, which can exacerbate heart failure. Close monitoring is crucial. The American Heart Association guidelines strongly advise caution."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Benzodiazepines should never be stopped abruptly due to the risk of withdrawal. Gradual tapering under medical supervision, combined with gentle nervines, is the safest and most ethical approach. This aligns with standard medical practice and ethical guidelines for herbalists."
