      "options": ["Immediately discontinue the formula and switch to a different herb.", "Ignore the symptoms and encourage the client to continue taking the formula as prescribed.", "Reduce the dosage of the formula, assess the client's response, and consider adding supportive herbs for digestion.", "Assume the digestive upset is unrelated to the herbal formula and advise the client to consult a gastroenterologist."],
