            "question": "Which of the following herbal actions is MOST directly associated with reducing systemic inflammation and promoting tissue repair, aligning with the cooling energetic principle?",
            "options": ["Stimulant", "Astringent", "Demulcent", "Rubefacient"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Demulcents, known for their soothing and moisturizing properties, align with cooling energetics by reducing irritation and inflammation, which manifests as heat in the body. Astringents can be cooling but primarily work by tightening tissues."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A client presents with chronic fatigue, cold extremities, and a pale complexion. According to herbal energetics, which herb would be MOST appropriate to incorporate into their formulation?",
            "options": ["Hawthorn Berry (Crataegus spp.)", "Ginger (Zingiber officinale)", "Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)", "Peppermint (Mentha × piperita)"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ginger is a warming herb that can help improve circulation and energy levels, addressing the client's symptoms of cold extremities and fatigue. Hawthorn is more neutral, chamomile is cooling, and peppermint is primarily cooling."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the action of nervine herbs?",
            "options": ["They primarily stimulate the central nervous system.", "They help to balance and calm the nervous system.", "They act as strong sedatives, inducing sleep.", "They primarily enhance cognitive function and memory."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Nervines are known for their ability to soothe and modulate the nervous system, reducing anxiety and promoting relaxation without necessarily causing sedation. Some nervines can be stimulating, but the balancing action is their hallmark."

        {
            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on adaptogens, what is the KEY mechanism by which these herbs support the body's stress response?",
            "options": ["They directly eliminate stressors from the body.", "They modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.", "They rapidly increase energy levels through caffeine-like effects.", "They block the perception of stress signals in the brain."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Adaptogens primarily work by modulating the HPA axis, the body's central stress response system, helping to regulate cortisol levels and improve resilience to stress. Direct stress elimination and caffeine-like effects are not characteristic of adaptogens."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "Which of the following is an example of a synergistic herbal blend, where the combined effect is greater than the sum of its individual parts?",
            "options": ["Echinacea (immune stimulant) + Goldenseal (antimicrobial)", "Lavender (nervine) + Chamomile (nervine)", "Licorice (adaptogen) + Ginger (warming)", "Milk Thistle (liver support) + Dandelion (diuretic)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Milk thistle supports liver detoxification, while dandelion promotes bile flow and elimination of toxins. Together, they synergistically enhance liver function. The other options are generally additive rather than synergistic."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "A client needs a high dose of a bitter herb for digestive support. Which delivery method would likely be MOST effective in mitigating the unpleasant taste?",
            "options": ["Tincture", "Capsule", "Tea", "Infused Oil"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Encapsulating the herb bypasses the taste buds, making it easier to ingest a high dose of a bitter herb. Tinctures and teas will expose the taste, and infused oils are not typically used for high-dose internal consumption of bitter herbs."

            "explanation": "Skullcap is a cooling nervine that can help calm the nervous system and promote relaxation, addressing anxiety and insomnia. Ashwagandha and Eleuthero are adaptogens, and Rosemary is warming and stimulating."

            "correctAnswer": 1,

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Recommending a warming digestive aid for someone with poor circulation and cold digestion directly addresses a constitutional imbalance according to herbal energetics, aiming to restore balance by counteracting the coldness. The other options address specific symptoms but not necessarily the underlying energetic constitution."
