            "question": "Which of the following herbal actions best describes an herb that promotes the expulsion of mucus from the respiratory system?",
            "options": ["Alterative", "Expectorant", "Carminative", "Nervine"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "An expectorant specifically aids in clearing mucus from the respiratory tract. Alteratives gradually restore proper body function, carminatives relieve gas, and nervines calm the nervous system."

            "id": "q3_2",
            "question": "In constitutional assessment, a client presenting with a red face, irritability, and a tendency towards inflammatory conditions would most likely be characterized by which primary energetic pattern?",
            "options": ["Cold/Dry", "Hot/Dry", "Cold/Damp", "Hot/Damp"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Redness and irritability suggest a 'Hot' energetic pattern, while inflammatory conditions indicate 'Dryness'. Therefore, Hot/Dry is the most likely constitutional type."

            "id": "q3_3",
            "question": "Which of the following herbs is best known for its adaptogenic properties, helping the body to resist stressors and improve overall resilience, as highlighted in the Materia Medica section?",
            "options": ["Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort)", "Echinacea purpurea (Purple Coneflower)", "Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha)", "Valeriana officinalis (Valerian)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Ashwagandha is a well-known adaptogen, traditionally used to enhance the body's resistance to stress. St. John's Wort is used for mood support, Echinacea for immune support, and Valerian for sleep."

            "id": "q3_4",
            "question": "When formulating an herbal blend, which of the following is the MOST important consideration for achieving synergy?",
            "options": ["Using herbs from the same geographical region", "Combining herbs with similar energetic properties", "Ensuring all herbs have a pleasant taste", "Addressing multiple aspects of the client's imbalance with different herbs"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Synergy in herbal formulation involves using multiple herbs that work together to address different facets of a health issue, creating a more comprehensive and effective treatment. While similar energetic properties can be helpful, addressing multiple aspects is key."

            "id": "q3_5",
            "question": "A 65-year-old client with a history of liver disease requires an herbal remedy for mild anxiety. Which form of administration is generally MOST appropriate to minimize potential burden on the liver?",
            "options": ["Standard tincture", "Capsules with powdered herb", "Herbal-infused oil for topical application", "Decoction (strong tea)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Topical application bypasses the liver's first-pass metabolism, making it the gentlest option for individuals with liver issues. Tinctures and decoctions involve internal processing, and capsules still require digestion."

        {
            "id": "q3_6",
            "question": "Which of the following is a significant contraindication for the use of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort)?",

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "St. John's Wort interacts with many medications, including SSRIs, potentially leading to serotonin syndrome. This is a serious contraindication. While the other options may be cautions, they are not absolute contraindications."

            "id": "q3_7",
            "question": "According to the PLANT framework discussed in the case studies, what does the 'T' represent?",

            "id": "q3_8",

            "options": ["Administer the herb but at a lower dosage", "Refuse to provide the herb and explain your reasoning clearly, documenting the interaction", "Administer the herb and closely monitor the client for adverse effects", "Suggest a different herb with similar properties without explaining your concerns"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ethical practice requires prioritizing client safety. Refusing to provide a potentially harmful herb while clearly explaining the reasons and documenting the interaction is the most responsible approach. Client autonomy does not supersede the practitioner's duty to protect them from harm."

            "question": "Which of the following is NOT typically considered within the scope of practice for a clinical herbalist?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diagnosing specific medical conditions is generally outside the scope of practice for a clinical herbalist, as it typically falls under the purview of licensed medical doctors. Herbalists can assess imbalances and recommend herbs to support overall health and well-being but should avoid making medical diagnoses."
