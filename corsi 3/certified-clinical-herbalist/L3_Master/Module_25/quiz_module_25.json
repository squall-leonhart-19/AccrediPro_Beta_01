            "question": "According to the lessons, what is the PRIMARY purpose of clinical supervision in herbalism?",
            "options": ["To evaluate the supervisee's herbal knowledge.", "To provide a safe and supportive space for professional development and client care improvement.", "To ensure the supervisee adheres strictly to traditional herbal practices.", "To promote the supervisor's herbal product line."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Clinical supervision focuses on fostering professional growth and enhancing client care, not just evaluation or adherence to tradition. The lessons emphasized a supportive environment for supervisee development."

            "options": ["Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for both supervisor and supervisee.", "Established goals and objectives for the supervision process.", "A rigid adherence to a specific herbal tradition, regardless of the client's needs.", "Regular feedback and evaluation mechanisms."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Flexibility and client-centered care are paramount. A rigid adherence to any single tradition may not serve the client's best interests. The framework should prioritize adaptability and individualized treatment."

            "id": "q25_3",
            "question": "What is a key difference between mentoring and supervision in the context of herbalism?",
            "options": ["Mentoring focuses solely on clinical skills, while supervision addresses ethical and legal considerations.", "Mentoring is typically more informal and relationship-based, while supervision is more structured and evaluative.", "Supervision is only provided by licensed healthcare professionals, while mentoring can be offered by experienced herbalists without formal licensure.", "There is no significant difference between mentoring and supervision in herbalism."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Mentoring is generally less structured and focuses on guidance and support, whereas supervision involves a more formal evaluation and accountability component. The lessons highlighted this distinction in relationship dynamics and structure."

            "id": "q25_5",
            "question": "A supervisee discloses that they are experiencing burnout due to a heavy caseload and personal stress. What is the MOST appropriate initial response from the supervisor?",
            "options": ["Suggest the supervisee take a vacation.", "Immediately reduce the supervisee's caseload without discussion.", "Acknowledge the supervisee's feelings, explore the underlying causes, and collaboratively develop a plan to address the burnout.", "Refer the supervisee to a different supervisor."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The most appropriate response is to acknowledge, explore, and collaboratively plan. This demonstrates empathy, supports the supervisee, and addresses the issue systematically. A vacation is a temporary solution, and reducing the caseload without discussion can disempower the supervisee."

        {
            "id": "q25_6",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Supervisors are ethically and legally obligated to address breaches of confidentiality. This involves discussing the issue with the supervisee and taking appropriate action, which may include reporting, depending on the severity and applicable regulations. The lessons emphasized a balanced approach that prioritizes client protection and supervisee development."

            "correctAnswer": 3,

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case conceptualization and differential diagnosis exercises can help the supervisee develop the necessary critical thinking skills to formulate appropriate protocols. Pre-made protocols limit learning, ignoring the issue is unhelpful, and criticism is counterproductive."
