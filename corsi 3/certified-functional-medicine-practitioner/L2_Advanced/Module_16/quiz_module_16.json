      "id": "q16_3",
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding the role of advanced lipid testing in managing Cardiometabolic Syndrome?",
      "options": [
        "Standard lipid panels (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) are sufficient for all patients.",
        "Advanced lipid testing provides a more detailed assessment of lipoprotein particle size and number, which can improve risk stratification and guide targeted interventions beyond standard lipid-lowering drugs.",
        "Advanced lipid testing is only useful in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.",
        "Advanced lipid testing is not recommended due to its high cost and lack of clinical utility."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Advanced lipid testing goes beyond standard panels, offering insights into LDL particle number (LDL-P) and size, which are more predictive of cardiovascular risk. Interventions can then be tailored to address specific lipoprotein abnormalities. A 2022 study in 'JAMA Cardiology' emphasized the importance of LDL-P in risk assessment."

      "id": "q16_4",
      "question": "A 32-year-old woman with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is struggling with insulin resistance and weight gain. Which of the following interventions is MOST likely to address both issues simultaneously?",
      "options": [
        "A very-low-calorie diet (VLCD).",
        "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with a low-glycemic load diet and supplementation with inositol.",
        "Prolonged endurance exercise.",
        "Prescription of oral contraceptives as the sole intervention."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Combining HIIT with a low-glycemic load diet and inositol supplementation addresses both insulin resistance and weight gain in PCOS. HIIT improves insulin sensitivity, a low-glycemic load diet helps regulate blood sugar, and inositol enhances insulin signaling. A 2023 systematic review in 'Nutrients' supports this multifaceted approach."

      "question": "Which of the following is a KEY diagnostic criterion for Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) using breath testing?",
      "options": [
        "A flatline reading on the breath test.",
        "A decrease in hydrogen and methane levels during the breath test.",
        "An early rise in hydrogen and/or methane levels (typically within 90 minutes) following lactulose or glucose ingestion.",
        "Normal bowel movements during the testing period."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A positive SIBO breath test is characterized by an early rise in hydrogen and/or methane levels after ingestion of lactulose or glucose, indicating bacterial fermentation in the small intestine. Clinical guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) define this criterion."
