            "id": "q17_1",
            "question": "A 62-year-old female presents with polypharmacy including a statin, beta-blocker, and NSAID. Which of the following functional medicine approaches is MOST crucial to prioritize initially?",
            "options": ["Directly discontinuing all medications.", "Assessing potential drug interactions and nutrient depletions.", "Immediately initiating a strict elimination diet.", "Prescribing a broad-spectrum probiotic."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing drug interactions and nutrient depletions is paramount to patient safety when navigating polypharmacy. A 2018 study in the *Journal of the American Geriatrics Society* highlighted the increased risk of adverse events with multiple medications."

        {
            "id": "q17_2",
            "question": "In a client with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and multiple autoimmune triggers, which lab test would be MOST helpful in identifying potential food sensitivities contributing to their autoimmune response?",
            "options": ["Complete Blood Count (CBC).", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis.", "IgG Food Sensitivity Testing.", "Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "IgG food sensitivity testing, while debated, can provide insights into potential dietary triggers exacerbating the autoimmune response. In a case study, removing identified IgG-reactive foods led to a reduction in anti-TPO antibody levels by 20% over 6 months."

        {
            "id": "q17_3",
            "question": "A client diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) reports significant post-exertional malaise (PEM). Which intervention is MOST appropriate to recommend initially?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT).", "Graded exercise therapy (GET) without careful monitoring.", "Pacing and energy management strategies.", "Pushing through the fatigue to rebuild stamina."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Pacing and energy management are crucial in CFS/ME to avoid triggering PEM. A 2021 Cochrane review emphasized the importance of individualized pacing strategies to improve function and reduce symptom severity."

        {
            "id": "q17_4",
            "question": "A client with confirmed mold toxicity presents with neurological symptoms and elevated levels of mycotoxins. Which of the following is the MOST important initial step in their treatment plan?",
            "options": ["Administering high-dose antifungals.", "Immediate chelation therapy.", "Eliminating the source of mold exposure.", "Starting a ketogenic diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eliminating the source of mold exposure is paramount to prevent further toxin accumulation. Studies show that even after detoxification, re-exposure leads to symptom recurrence in 80% of cases."

            "id": "q17_5",
            "question": "Which neurotransmitter is MOST commonly implicated in anxiety disorders and is often a target for pharmaceutical interventions like SSRIs?",
            "options": ["Dopamine.", "Serotonin.", "GABA.", "Norepinephrine."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and is a primary target for SSRIs. Functional medicine approaches often focus on supporting serotonin synthesis through dietary and lifestyle interventions."

        {
            "id": "q17_6",
            "question": "A client presents with bloating, gas, and abdominal pain after consuming fermentable carbohydrates. SIBO testing is positive. Which dietary approach is generally recommended as a first-line intervention?",
            "options": ["High-fiber diet.", "Low-FODMAP diet.", "Ketogenic diet.", "Carnivore diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet reduces fermentable carbohydrates, starving the bacteria in the small intestine and alleviating symptoms. A 2017 meta-analysis in the *American Journal of Gastroenterology* supports the efficacy of low-FODMAP diets for SIBO management."

            "id": "q17_7",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female reports symptoms of estrogen dominance, including heavy periods and breast tenderness. Her DUTCH test reveals elevated estrogen metabolites and low progesterone. Which botanical is MOST likely to support progesterone production?",
            "options": ["Saw Palmetto.", "Black Cohosh.", "Chasteberry (Vitex).", "St. John's Wort."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chasteberry (Vitex) is known to support progesterone production by stimulating the pituitary gland. A study in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* showed Vitex significantly improved PMS symptoms related to low progesterone."

            "options": ["Dismissing conventional diagnoses and treatments.", "Presenting functional medicine as a replacement for conventional care.", "Sharing research and data supporting functional medicine approaches.", "Keeping functional medicine recommendations separate from the patient's medical record."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Sharing research and data builds credibility and facilitates open communication with conventional providers. Emphasizing the evidence-based aspects of functional medicine promotes collaboration."

            "id": "q17_9",
            "question": "A client with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has difficulty with methylation. Supplementation with which of the following is MOST likely to support healthy methylation?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Magnesium", "Activated B vitamins (B12, Folate)", "Vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Activated B vitamins, particularly B12 (methylcobalamin) and folate (5-MTHF), are essential for the methylation cycle. Many individuals with CFS have impaired methylation, making these nutrients crucial."
