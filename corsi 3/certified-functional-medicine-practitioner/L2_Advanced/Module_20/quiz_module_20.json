        {
            "id": "q20_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical element to uncover during advanced history taking in Functional Medicine?",
            "options": ["Patient's favorite foods", "Detailed timeline of environmental exposures and life events", "Family's vacation history", "Number of siblings the patient has"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A detailed timeline helps connect symptoms to potential triggers and understand the patient's unique journey, revealing hidden clues often missed in conventional assessments."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "During a Functional Physical Exam, what is the primary purpose of assessing posture and gait?",
            "options": ["To diagnose structural abnormalities only", "To evaluate neuromuscular imbalances and movement patterns", "To determine shoe size", "To assess skin pigmentation"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Assessing posture and gait helps identify subtle neuromuscular imbalances that can contribute to pain, dysfunction, and systemic health issues. This aligns with the holistic approach of Functional Medicine."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "When interpreting standard lab tests from a Functional Medicine perspective, what is a key difference compared to conventional medicine?",
            "options": ["Focusing solely on diagnosing disease states", "Looking for optimal ranges rather than just 'normal' ranges", "Ignoring reference ranges altogether", "Prescribing medication based on any abnormal result"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional Medicine aims to identify imbalances before they manifest as disease. By looking at optimal ranges, practitioners can detect subclinical dysfunction and intervene proactively."

        {
            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "Which specialized functional medicine test is MOST appropriate for assessing intestinal permeability (leaky gut)?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive Metabolic Panel", "Organic Acids Test", "Lactulose/Mannitol Test", "Complete Blood Count"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The Lactulose/Mannitol test directly measures the passage of these sugars across the intestinal lining, providing an indication of intestinal permeability."

        {
            "id": "q20_5",
            "question": "A patient's genetic test reveals a homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation. What is the MOST appropriate initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Prescribe high-dose folic acid", "Recommend a diet high in processed foods", "Assess B vitamin status and consider methylated folate supplementation", "Ignore the result as it's just a genetic predisposition"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "MTHFR mutations can impair folate metabolism. Assessing B vitamin status and considering methylated folate can help bypass the metabolic block. High-dose folic acid may be counterproductive in some cases."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "Which type of food sensitivity testing is generally considered the MOST reliable for identifying delayed food sensitivities?",
            "options": ["IgG antibody testing", "Skin prick testing", "IgE antibody testing", "Elimination diet and reintroduction"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While IgG testing is commonly used, elimination diets followed by careful reintroduction are often considered the gold standard for identifying delayed food sensitivities due to their direct observation of symptoms."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "Which environmental toxin assessment method is MOST appropriate for assessing long-term exposure to heavy metals?",
            "options": ["Hair analysis", "Urine challenge test", "Blood test", "Saliva test"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Urine challenge tests, using chelating agents, can help mobilize and measure stored heavy metals, providing a more accurate assessment of long-term exposure compared to blood or hair analysis alone."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain. Her standard lab tests are within normal limits. Based on Functional Medicine principles, what is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Reassure her that she is healthy", "Prescribe an antidepressant", "Conduct a thorough history, functional physical exam, and consider specialized testing", "Refer her to a rheumatologist immediately"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Functional Medicine emphasizes a comprehensive approach. Even with normal standard labs, a thorough investigation can uncover underlying imbalances contributing to her symptoms. Specialized testing might reveal hidden issues."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_9",
            "question": "According to case studies discussed, which of the following is a common finding in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) identified through functional medicine testing?",
            "options": ["Elevated white blood cell count", "Normal gut microbiome", "Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress", "High levels of vitamin D"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Case studies often reveal that patients with CFS exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, which can be identified through specialized functional medicine testing, such as organic acids testing."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_10",
            "question": "When integrating assessment tools into a comprehensive Functional Medicine plan, what is the MOST important principle to consider?",
            "options": ["Treating every abnormal lab value with medication", "Focusing solely on the patient's symptoms", "Using assessment data to create a personalized, root-cause-focused intervention plan", "Ignoring the patient's history and focusing only on lab results"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The goal of Functional Medicine is to address the underlying causes of illness. Assessment data should be used to create a personalized plan that addresses these root causes, not just manage symptoms or treat isolated lab values."
