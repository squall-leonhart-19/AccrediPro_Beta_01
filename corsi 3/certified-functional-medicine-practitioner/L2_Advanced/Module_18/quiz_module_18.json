            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the symptoms and lab findings, a short-term elemental diet to reduce antigenic load and gut inflammation, followed by a systematic food reintroduction protocol to identify specific triggers, is the most appropriate initial intervention. This addresses the gut-immune axis dysfunction."

            "id": "q18_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the Mind-Body Medicine lesson, which of the following practices has demonstrated the MOST significant impact on reducing cortisol levels and improving heart rate variability (HRV)?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Mindfulness meditation", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "Cold water immersion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Studies have consistently shown that mindfulness meditation is highly effective in reducing cortisol levels and improving HRV, indicating a positive impact on the stress response system. While other practices can be beneficial, mindfulness meditation has the strongest evidence base for these specific outcomes."

            "question": "In the context of lifestyle integration, what is the primary goal of 'Motivational Interviewing'?",
            "options": ["To directly instruct patients on how to change their behaviors.", "To persuade patients to adopt specific health recommendations.", "To explore and resolve ambivalence about behavior change.", "To provide patients with a detailed list of dietary restrictions."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Motivational Interviewing is a patient-centered approach that aims to help individuals explore and resolve their ambivalence about behavior change, fostering intrinsic motivation and increasing the likelihood of long-term adherence to lifestyle modifications."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with persistent fatigue, weight gain, and brain fog despite adhering to a strict diet and exercise regimen. Initial lab work reveals normal thyroid hormone levels. Considering the principles of advanced case analysis, what is the NEXT best step?",
            "options": ["Prescribe a thyroid hormone supplement.", "Order comprehensive stool testing to assess gut microbiome composition and function.", "Recommend a more intense exercise program.", "Advise the patient to consult a psychiatrist."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given the persistent symptoms despite lifestyle modifications and normal thyroid function, assessing the gut microbiome is a logical next step. Gut dysbiosis can significantly impact energy levels, weight management, and cognitive function, potentially explaining the patient's symptoms."

            "id": "q18_7",
            "question": "A functional medicine practitioner is treating a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Advanced testing reveals elevated levels of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antibodies. How might this finding influence the treatment plan?",
            "options": ["The EBV antibodies are likely a false positive and can be disregarded.", "The practitioner should immediately prescribe an antiviral medication.", "The practitioner should consider addressing the underlying immune dysfunction and potential EBV reactivation as a contributing factor to the Hashimoto's.", "The practitioner should recommend thyroid surgery."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated EBV antibodies suggest potential viral reactivation, which can contribute to immune dysregulation and exacerbate autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's. Addressing the underlying immune dysfunction and potential EBV reactivation becomes a crucial aspect of the treatment plan."
