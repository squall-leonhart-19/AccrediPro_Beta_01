        {
            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a primary consideration when implementing an advanced dietary strategy for a client with suspected <span class=\"highlight\">mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS)</span>?",
            "options": ["Histamine content of foods", "Oxalate levels in vegetables", "Glycemic index of carbohydrates", "Lectins present in grains and legumes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While histamine, oxalates, and lectins can trigger reactions in sensitive individuals, glycemic index is less directly related to MCAS. The focus is on reducing mast cell degranulation triggers."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "A client presents with persistent fatigue, brain fog, and elevated levels of heavy metals (assessed via hair mineral analysis). Which of the following supplementation protocols would be MOST appropriate as an initial step in their detoxification process?",
            "options": ["High-dose intravenous glutathione", "Chlorella and modified citrus pectin", "Chelation therapy with EDTA", "Activated charcoal alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chlorella and modified citrus pectin are gentle and effective binders that can support the initial phases of detoxification without overwhelming the system. High-dose glutathione or chelation may be too aggressive initially."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to case studies discussed, what is the estimated percentage of individuals with <span class=\"highlight\">Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</span> who may have Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)?",
            "options": ["5-15%", "20-35%", "40-85%", "90-95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Studies and case reviews suggest that SIBO may be present in a significant portion of IBS patients, with estimates ranging from 40-85%."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a key difference between <span class=\"highlight\">bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT)</span> and conventional hormone replacement therapy?",
            "options": ["BHRT uses hormones that are structurally identical to those produced by the human body.", "Conventional HRT is always derived from plant sources.", "BHRT is only available in oral form.", "Conventional HRT is safer due to extensive long-term studies."],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Bioidentical hormones have the same molecular structure as endogenous hormones, whereas conventional HRT often uses synthetic or conjugated hormones from animal sources."

            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing chronic stress and anxiety. Which advanced mind-body technique would be MOST appropriate for initially downregulating the sympathetic nervous system?",
            "options": ["Intense aerobic exercise", "Progressive muscle relaxation", "High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Cold water immersion"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Progressive muscle relaxation is a gentle and effective technique for reducing muscle tension and promoting relaxation, making it suitable for initially downregulating the sympathetic nervous system. Other options could be too stimulating for someone experiencing chronic stress."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "In the H.E.A.L.S. Framework™, what does the 'L' represent?",
            "options": ["Lifestyle", "Laboratory Testing", "Longevity", "Liver Support"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the H.E.A.L.S. Framework™, 'L' represents Lifestyle, encompassing dietary habits, exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress management techniques."

        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "Which advanced gut health restoration strategy focuses on modulating the gut microbiome by selectively promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria?",
            "options": ["Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)", "Probiotic supplementation", "Prebiotic supplementation", "Antibiotic therapy"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Prebiotic supplementation involves consuming non-digestible fibers that nourish beneficial gut bacteria, promoting their growth and diversity. While probiotics introduce new bacteria, prebiotics feed the existing beneficial ones."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_8",
            "question": "A client taking thyroid medication (levothyroxine) continues to experience hypothyroid symptoms despite normal TSH levels. Which advanced assessment might be helpful to evaluate thyroid hormone metabolism?",
            "options": ["Complete Blood Count (CBC)", "Comprehensive Stool Analysis", "Reverse T3 (rT3) testing", "Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Measuring reverse T3 (rT3) can provide insight into whether T4 is being converted to the inactive rT3 form instead of active T3, potentially explaining persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite normal TSH."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "Which of the following supplements is often used in advanced protocols to support phase II liver detoxification, specifically <span class=\"highlight\">glutathione conjugation</span>?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "N-acetylcysteine (NAC)", "Calcium", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a precursor to glutathione, a critical antioxidant and detoxifying agent involved in phase II liver detoxification, particularly glutathione conjugation."

            "id": "q23_10",
            "question": "In a case study, a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivities showed significant improvement after implementing a personalized protocol that included mitochondrial support, gut healing, and stress reduction techniques. Which H.E.A.L.S. Framework™ domain was MOST directly addressed by the mitochondrial support?",
            "options": ["Healing Opportunities", "Environmental Inputs", "Adaptive Capacity", "Lifestyle"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mitochondrial support directly addresses the Adaptive Capacity domain of the H.E.A.L.S. Framework™, as mitochondria are crucial for cellular energy production and the body's ability to adapt to stressors."
