            "id": "q21_2",
            "question": "A patient presents with persistent fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues. After a thorough assessment, you suspect leaky gut syndrome. Which dietary intervention is MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["A ketogenic diet to reduce inflammation.", "A high-fiber diet to promote gut motility.", "An elimination diet focusing on common food sensitivities (gluten, dairy, soy).", "A raw food diet to increase enzyme intake."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eliminating common food sensitivities helps reduce gut inflammation and allows the gut lining to begin to heal. This approach is supported by clinical experience and research on food sensitivities and gut health."

            "id": "q21_6",
            "question": "A patient has been following a functional medicine treatment plan for three months. They report some improvement but are still experiencing symptoms. What is the MOST appropriate next step?",
            "options": ["Immediately discontinue the current plan and start a new approach.", "Increase the dosage of all supplements.", "Re-evaluate the patient's history, conduct further testing if necessary, and adjust the plan based on new findings.", "Tell the patient to be patient and wait longer for results."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Continuous monitoring and adjustment are essential in functional medicine. Re-evaluation allows for personalized refinement of the treatment plan based on the patient's response and any new information."
