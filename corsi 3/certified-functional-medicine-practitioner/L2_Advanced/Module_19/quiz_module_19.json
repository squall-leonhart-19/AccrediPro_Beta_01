            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 means there is a 3% probability that the observed results are due to chance, typically considered statistically significant (p < 0.05)."

            "options": ["Individuals with high homocysteine have a 50% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.", "Individuals with high homocysteine have a 1.5% increased risk of cardiovascular disease.", "Individuals with high homocysteine have a 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease.", "The homocysteine level has no impact on cardiovascular disease risk."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A relative risk of 1.5 indicates a 50% increased risk (RR - 1 = % increase) of developing cardiovascular disease in the group with high homocysteine levels."

            "id": "q19_5",
            "question": "In the context of personalized nutrition plans, which research approach would be MOST helpful in determining the optimal diet for a specific patient with IBS, considering their unique microbiome profile?",
            "options": ["Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on general IBS dietary guidelines", "Single case study reports of successful IBS treatments", "N-of-1 trial using various dietary interventions and symptom tracking", "Expert opinion from a gastroenterologist"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An N-of-1 trial allows for personalized experimentation and data collection to determine the best dietary intervention for a specific patient, considering their individual microbiome profile and symptom response."

            "id": "q19_6",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the Mind-Body Therapies lesson, what is the MOST likely mechanism by which mindfulness meditation reduces chronic pain?",
            "options": ["Increased production of endorphins", "Directly blocking pain receptors", "Modulating activity in brain regions associated with pain perception and emotional regulation", "Releasing muscle tension in the affected area"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that mindfulness meditation alters brain activity in regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, which are involved in pain perception and emotional processing, leading to reduced pain experience."

            "id": "q19_7",
            "question": "A study examining the effects of glyphosate exposure on gut microbiome diversity in agricultural workers finds a statistically significant (p < 0.01) reduction in beneficial bacteria. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in applying this research to clinical practice?",
            "options": ["Immediately recommending all patients avoid glyphosate exposure, regardless of their individual risk factors.", "Considering glyphosate exposure as a potential contributing factor in patients with gut dysbiosis and exploring strategies to mitigate exposure.", "Prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics to eliminate any remaining glyphosate in the gut.", "Dismissing the study findings as irrelevant to clinical practice due to the specific population studied."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "It's important to consider research findings in the context of individual patient risk factors and explore mitigation strategies. Blanket recommendations or extreme interventions are not always appropriate."

            "options": ["To replace rigorous randomized controlled trials.", "To generate data that is directly applicable to the clinic's patient population and practice setting.", "To secure funding for future research projects.", "To publish findings in high-impact medical journals."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "PBR generates real-world evidence that is highly relevant to the specific patient population and treatment approaches used in the clinic, improving the applicability of research findings."

            "options": ["Urine mycotoxin test", "Blood heavy metal panel", "Comprehensive stool analysis", "Allergy skin prick test"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Urine mycotoxin tests are commonly used as an initial screening tool to assess exposure to mycotoxins, which can be indicative of mold toxicity."
