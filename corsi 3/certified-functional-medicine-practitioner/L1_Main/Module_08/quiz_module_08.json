            "question": "According to the lessons, which of the following is considered a keystone species in the gut microbiome, significantly influencing the overall ecosystem?",
            "options": ["Escherichia coli", "Akkermansia muciniphila", "Candida albicans", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Akkermansia muciniphila is a keystone species known for its role in maintaining the gut's mucus layer and promoting overall gut health. Its presence is often associated with a healthier gut ecosystem."

            "id": "q8_2",
            "question": "What is the primary focus of the 'H' component within the H.E.A.L.S. framework for assessing gut health?",
            "options": ["Hormonal imbalances", "Health history", "Hydration status", "Hepatic function"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The 'H' in the H.E.A.L.S. framework stands for Health History. This involves gathering detailed information about the patient's past and present health conditions, medications, and lifestyle factors that may impact gut health."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with bloating, gas, and irregular bowel movements. Her history reveals frequent antibiotic use in the past. Which dietary strategy would be MOST appropriate as an initial intervention?",
            "options": ["Strict ketogenic diet", "High FODMAP diet", "Elimination diet focusing on common allergens", "Prolonged fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "An elimination diet focusing on common allergens like gluten, dairy, and soy is often a good starting point for individuals with gut issues, especially after antibiotic use. This helps identify potential food sensitivities contributing to the symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q8_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a primary mechanism by which prebiotics support gut health?",
            "options": ["Directly killing pathogenic bacteria", "Providing nourishment for beneficial bacteria", "Reducing intestinal inflammation via NSAID action", "Blocking nutrient absorption"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers that selectively promote the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the gut, providing them with a source of nourishment."

        {
            "id": "q8_5",
            "question": "According to studies discussed in the module, what percentage of the gut microbiome's composition is generally established by the age of 3?",
            "options": ["20%", "50%", "80%", "95%"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Research suggests that approximately 80% of an individual's gut microbiome composition is established by the age of 3, highlighting the importance of early-life influences on gut health."

        {
            "id": "q8_6",
            "question": "Which lifestyle modification is MOST directly associated with reducing intestinal permeability (leaky gut)?",
            "options": ["High-intensity interval training (HIIT)", "Regular meditation and mindfulness practices", "Intermittent fasting with a 16-hour fasting window", "Consumption of artificial sweeteners"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress can increase intestinal permeability. Regular meditation and mindfulness practices can help manage stress levels, thereby reducing the likelihood of leaky gut. Studies show a correlation between stress reduction techniques and improved gut barrier function."

        {
            "id": "q8_7",
            "question": "A client reports significant improvement in their gut symptoms after following a gut restoration protocol. What is the MOST important long-term strategy to prevent relapse?",
            "options": ["Continuing high doses of probiotics indefinitely", "Maintaining a diverse diet rich in fiber and fermented foods", "Strictly avoiding all carbohydrates", "Consuming a liquid-only diet once a week"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Sustaining a diverse diet rich in fiber and fermented foods is crucial for long-term gut health and relapse prevention. This approach nourishes a wide range of beneficial bacteria and promotes a balanced gut ecosystem."

        {
            "id": "q8_8",
            "question": "What is the primary ethical consideration when considering Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) as a treatment option?",
            "options": ["Cost of the procedure", "Donor screening and safety", "Patient preference", "Ease of administration"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Donor screening and safety are paramount in FMT to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases or undesirable microbial strains to the recipient. Thorough screening protocols are essential to minimize risks."

            "id": "q8_9",
            "question": "A client with a history of anxiety and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) reports that their symptoms worsen during stressful periods at work. Which mind-body practice would be MOST appropriate to recommend?",
            "options": ["Weightlifting", "Marathon running", "Diaphragmatic breathing exercises", "Competitive sports"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Diaphragmatic breathing exercises can help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing the physiological effects of stress and potentially alleviating IBS symptoms. Given the gut-brain axis connection, reducing stress is key."
