        {
            "id": "q7_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT considered a primary function of the gut microbiome?",
            "options": ["Nutrient absorption", "Immune system modulation", "Neurotransmitter production", "Production of stomach acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The gut microbiome primarily focuses on nutrient absorption, immune modulation, and neurotransmitter production. Stomach acid production is a function of the stomach itself, not the microbiome."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_2",
            "question": "A patient presents with symptoms suggestive of leaky gut syndrome. Which biomarker is MOST directly indicative of intestinal permeability?",
            "options": ["Elevated levels of zonulin", "Decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)", "Increased levels of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacteria)", "Reduced inflammation markers like C-reactive protein (CRP)"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Elevated zonulin levels directly indicate increased intestinal permeability, as zonulin regulates tight junctions in the gut lining."
        },

            "id": "q7_3",
            "question": "According to studies discussed in the SIBO lesson, which breath test gases are typically measured to diagnose SIBO?",
            "options": ["Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide", "Hydrogen and Methane", "Nitrogen and Helium", "Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Hydrogen and methane are the primary gases measured in breath tests for SIBO, as they are produced by bacteria in the small intestine."

            "id": "q7_4",
            "question": "A client reports experiencing bloating, gas, and skin rashes after consuming dairy products. Which type of immune reaction is MOST likely involved?",
            "options": ["IgE-mediated allergy", "IgG-mediated food sensitivity", "IgA-mediated food allergy", "Cell-mediated hypersensitivity"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Bloating, gas, and skin rashes are commonly associated with IgG-mediated food sensitivities, which are delayed reactions compared to IgE allergies."

        {
            "id": "q7_5",
            "question": "Which of the following neurotransmitters is MOST directly linked to gut health via the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["Dopamine", "Serotonin", "Norepinephrine", "GABA"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Serotonin, with approximately 90% produced in the gut, plays a crucial role in mood regulation and is significantly influenced by the gut microbiome."

        {
            "id": "q7_6",
            "question": "In the context of gut-related inflammation, which dietary component is MOST likely to exacerbate systemic inflammation?",
            "options": ["Omega-3 fatty acids", "Probiotics", "Refined sugars and processed foods", "Fermented vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Refined sugars and processed foods are known to promote inflammation in the gut, leading to systemic inflammation due to increased intestinal permeability and endotoxin release."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_7",
            "question": "During Phase I detoxification in the liver, which enzyme family plays a primary role in metabolizing toxins?",
            "options": ["Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)", "Cytochrome P450 enzymes", "UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs)", "Sulfotransferases (SULTs)"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Cytochrome P450 enzymes are essential for Phase I detoxification, oxidizing toxins to make them more water-soluble for subsequent Phase II conjugation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_8",
            "question": "In a case study, a 45-year-old female presented with fatigue, brain fog, and recurrent yeast infections. Stool testing revealed dysbiosis with an overgrowth of Candida albicans. Which intervention would be MOST appropriate as an initial step?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Implementing a low-FODMAP diet", "Initiating a sugar-restricted diet and antifungal protocol", "Prescribing a high-dose probiotic supplement"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the Candida overgrowth, a sugar-restricted diet combined with a targeted antifungal protocol is most appropriate to address the yeast overgrowth while supporting gut health."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_9",
            "question": "A 2023 meta-analysis of 42 studies (n=8,234) found that specific probiotic strains significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression. Which of the following is a likely mechanism of action?",
            "options": ["Direct stimulation of the vagus nerve", "Increased production of stomach acid", "Inhibition of liver detoxification enzymes", "Decreased intestinal transit time"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Probiotic strains can influence mental health by directly stimulating the vagus nerve, which connects the gut and brain, modulating neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation."
        },
        {
            "id": "q7_10",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate description of the bidirectional communication in the gut-brain axis?",
            "options": ["The brain solely controls gut function through the vagus nerve.", "The gut solely influences brain function through nutrient absorption.", "The gut and brain communicate through neural, hormonal, and immunological pathways.", "Communication is limited to the release of neurotransmitters from the brain to the gut."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The gut-brain axis involves complex bidirectional communication via neural pathways (e.g., vagus nerve), hormonal signals (e.g., cortisol), and immunological factors (e.g., cytokines)."
