                "SCFAs have no significant impact on the gut-brain axis."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "SCFAs, particularly butyrate, propionate, and acetate, are produced by the fermentation of dietary fiber by beneficial bacteria. They are essential for gut health, energy production, and have systemic metabolic effects, including influencing the gut-brain axis."

            ],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
