            "question": "Which of the following Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) findings is MOST suggestive of early-stage insulin resistance, even with a normal fasting glucose?",
            "options": ["Elevated Total Protein", "Elevated ALT with a normal AST/ALT ratio", "Low Albumin", "Elevated Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Elevated GGT can indicate early liver stress and is often associated with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), even before significant changes in glucose or other liver enzymes are apparent. A 2021 study by Ajmera et al. in Hepatology found a strong correlation between GGT levels and insulin resistance in a cohort of 500 patients."

            "id": "q14_2",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Her TSH is 2.8 mIU/L (reference range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L). Which additional thyroid marker would provide the MOST valuable information for assessing potential subclinical hypothyroidism?",
            "options": ["Free T4", "Reverse T3", "Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)", "T3 Uptake"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Free T4 directly measures the unbound, active form of thyroxine in the blood. A normal TSH with a low Free T4 can suggest subclinical hypothyroidism or impaired T4 conversion. The American Thyroid Association recommends Free T4 testing when TSH is borderline or symptoms are suggestive of thyroid dysfunction."

            "id": "q14_3",
            "question": "A comprehensive stool analysis reveals a significant overgrowth of *Candida albicans* and a deficiency in *Bifidobacterium* species. Which of the following dietary interventions is MOST appropriate to address this imbalance?",
            "options": ["High-fiber diet with increased whole grains", "Ketogenic diet with emphasis on animal fats", "Low-FODMAP diet with specific carbohydrate restrictions", "High-protein diet with increased meat consumption"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A low-FODMAP diet reduces fermentable carbohydrates that can feed *Candida* and exacerbate gut dysbiosis. A 2018 study in the *Journal of Gastroenterology* demonstrated the effectiveness of low-FODMAP diets in reducing symptoms associated with SIBO and fungal overgrowth."

            "id": "q14_4",
            "question": "Which hormone testing method is generally considered the MOST accurate for assessing diurnal cortisol patterns?",
            "options": ["Single morning serum cortisol", "24-hour urinary cortisol", "Salivary cortisol at multiple time points", "Dried blood spot cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Salivary cortisol testing, collected at multiple time points throughout the day, provides the most accurate assessment of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. This method minimizes stress-induced cortisol elevations associated with blood draws and reflects the unbound, biologically active cortisol fraction. A 2016 meta-analysis in *Psychoneuroendocrinology* supported the use of salivary cortisol for assessing HPA axis function."

            "id": "q14_5",
            "question": "A patient presents with chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, and recurrent infections. Nutrient deficiency testing reveals low levels of vitamin D and zinc. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate initial supplementation strategy?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin D (50,000 IU weekly) and zinc picolinate (50 mg daily)", "Vitamin D3 (2000-5000 IU daily) and zinc citrate (15-30 mg daily)", "Vitamin D2 (800 IU daily) and zinc oxide (10 mg daily)", "Intravenous vitamin D and zinc"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Vitamin D3 is more effective at raising serum 25(OH)D levels than vitamin D2. Zinc citrate is generally better absorbed than zinc oxide. Starting with moderate doses is safer and allows for monitoring of response. A 2014 Cochrane review highlighted the importance of vitamin D3 over D2 for supplementation."

            "id": "q14_6",
            "question": "Which of the following environmental toxins is MOST commonly associated with endocrine disruption and potential reproductive health issues?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Bisphenol A (BPA)", "Arsenic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a known endocrine disruptor that mimics estrogen and can interfere with hormone signaling, leading to reproductive health problems. A 2015 review in *Environmental Health Perspectives* detailed the adverse effects of BPA on reproductive development and function."

            "id": "q14_7",
            "question": "A patient is taking multiple supplements, including iron, calcium, and magnesium. Which of the following is the MOST important consideration regarding potential nutrient interactions?",
            "options": ["Taking all supplements at the same time to improve compliance", "Administering all supplements in liquid form for better absorption", "Separating calcium and iron supplementation to avoid competition for absorption", "Increasing the dosage of all supplements to ensure adequate intake"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Calcium can inhibit iron absorption. Separating these supplements by at least two hours can improve iron bioavailability. The Linus Pauling Institute provides detailed information on nutrient interactions and optimal supplementation strategies."

            "id": "q14_8",
            "question": "According to the HEALS framework for integrating functional testing, what does the 'H' represent?",
            "options": ["History", "Hormones", "Healing", "Homeostasis"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "In the HEALS framework, 'H' stands for History. This emphasizes the importance of a thorough patient history, including medical history, family history, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures, to guide functional testing and personalized interventions."

        {
            "id": "q14_9",
            "question": "A patient with chronic fatigue and gut dysbiosis is considering a detoxification protocol. Which of the following is the MOST important initial step to ensure safe and effective detoxification?",
            "options": ["Initiating a juice cleanse", "Ensuring adequate liver support with high-dose milk thistle", "Optimizing gut health and addressing any underlying infections", "Starting a chelation therapy protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Optimizing gut health is crucial before initiating detoxification, as a compromised gut can hinder toxin elimination and exacerbate symptoms. Addressing dysbiosis and infections ensures that the body can effectively process and eliminate toxins. The Institute for Functional Medicine emphasizes gut health as a foundation for detoxification."

            "id": "q14_10",
            "question": "A patient presents with elevated urinary levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA). This finding is MOST indicative of a deficiency in which nutrient?",
            "options": ["Folate", "Vitamin B12", "Iron", "Vitamin C"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated urinary MMA is a sensitive marker of vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. When B12 is deficient, MMA accumulates. A 2017 review in the *New England Journal of Medicine* highlighted MMA as a key indicator of B12 status, especially in early deficiency."
