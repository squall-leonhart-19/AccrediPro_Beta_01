        {
            "id": "q15_1",
            "question": "Which of the following organic acid markers is MOST indicative of a potential issue with mitochondrial dysfunction, specifically related to the Krebs cycle?",
            "options": ["Hippuric acid", "Methylmalonic acid", "Kynurenic acid", "Fumaric acid"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Fumaric acid is a direct intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Elevated levels suggest a potential block or bottleneck in this crucial energy production pathway. Methylmalonic acid is more closely associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_2",
            "question": "A patient's SIBO breath test reveals elevated levels of both hydrogen and methane. Based on the L2 deep dive, which of the following treatment approaches would be the MOST comprehensive?",
            "options": ["Rifaximin alone", "Neomycin alone", "A combination of Rifaximin and Neomycin", "A low-FODMAP diet alone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The presence of both hydrogen and methane suggests a mixed SIBO picture. Rifaximin targets primarily hydrogen-producing bacteria, while Neomycin targets methane-producing archaea. A combination is often necessary for optimal results in such cases."

        {
            "id": "q15_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on environmental toxin exposure, which of the following statements regarding glyphosate is MOST accurate?",
            "options": ["Glyphosate is rapidly metabolized and excreted, posing minimal long-term risk.", "Glyphosate's primary mechanism of toxicity involves disruption of the shikimate pathway in bacteria.", "Glyphosate exposure is solely linked to agricultural applications.", "Chelation therapy is the most effective method for removing glyphosate from the body."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Glyphosate disrupts the shikimate pathway, essential for bacteria and plants but absent in humans. This disruption can have significant downstream effects on the gut microbiome. While chelation is used for heavy metals, it's not the primary approach for glyphosate."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with persistent fatigue, brain fog, and low cortisol levels throughout the day, despite adequate sleep. Based on the adrenal dysfunction module, which adaptogen would be MOST appropriate to start with, considering its potential to gently support cortisol production?",
            "options": ["Ashwagandha", "Rhodiola Rosea", "Eleuthero", "Licorice Root"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Eleuthero is often a good starting point for adrenal support due to its generally milder effects compared to Ashwagandha or Rhodiola. Licorice root can increase cortisol levels but should be used cautiously due to potential side effects."

        {
            "id": "q15_5",
            "question": "Genetic testing reveals that a patient has a homozygous variant in the MTHFR gene (C677T). According to the personalized nutrition plans lesson, which of the following nutritional interventions is MOST crucial?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin C supplementation", "Strict gluten-free diet", "Supplementation with 5-MTHF (methylfolate)", "Increased intake of cruciferous vegetables"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "A homozygous MTHFR C677T variant reduces the enzyme's activity, impairing folate metabolism. Supplementation with 5-MTHF bypasses the impaired enzyme, ensuring adequate folate availability."
        },
        {
            "id": "q15_6",
            "question": "In the H.E.A.L.S. Framework™, what does the 'S' represent, and how does it primarily contribute to addressing complex cases?",
            "options": ["Supplements: Direct supplementation to address specific deficiencies.", "Support: Building a strong support network for the patient.", "Sleep: Optimizing sleep quality and duration for recovery.", "Stress Reduction: Implementing techniques to manage and mitigate stress."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "The 'S' in H.E.A.L.S.™ represents Stress Reduction. Managing stress is crucial in complex cases as chronic stress can exacerbate underlying conditions and hinder the healing process."

        {
            "id": "q15_7",
            "question": "Which mind-body technique has been shown in studies to have the MOST significant impact on reducing inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP)?",
            "options": ["Progressive Muscle Relaxation", "Guided Imagery", "Mindfulness Meditation", "Autogenic Training"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Mindfulness meditation, particularly practices focusing on present moment awareness, have demonstrated consistent reductions in inflammatory markers like CRP in numerous studies."

        {
            "id": "q15_8",
            "question": "A patient who has successfully completed a SIBO treatment protocol is now in the maintenance phase. Which of the following dietary strategies is MOST important for preventing relapse, based on the long-term health maintenance lesson?",
            "options": ["Completely eliminating all fermentable carbohydrates", "Implementing a strict ketogenic diet", "Following a cyclical low-FODMAP approach", "Consuming a high-fiber diet with diverse plant-based foods"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "A high-fiber diet with diverse plant-based foods promotes a healthy and resilient gut microbiome, reducing the risk of SIBO recurrence. While low-FODMAP can be helpful acutely, long-term restriction can negatively impact the microbiome."

        {
            "id": "q15_9",
            "question": "A client presents with recurring symptoms 6 months after successful treatment for Lyme disease. Which of the following is the MOST critical initial step in assessing their condition, according to the module on long-term health maintenance?",
            "options": ["Immediately re-administering antibiotics", "Ordering repeat Lyme disease testing", "Evaluating for co-infections and immune dysfunction", "Initiating a detoxification protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recurring symptoms post-Lyme treatment often indicate persistent co-infections or ongoing immune dysregulation, rather than a simple relapse of the original infection. Addressing these underlying factors is crucial."

        {
            "id": "q15_10",
            "question": "Case Study: A 45-year-old female presents with chronic fatigue, anxiety, and digestive issues. Organic acids testing reveals elevated levels of quinolinic acid. Which of the following interventions would be MOST appropriate, considering the implications of quinolinic acid elevation?",
            "options": ["Administering a broad-spectrum antibiotic", "Supplementing with high-dose tryptophan", "Addressing potential inflammation and supporting the kynurenine pathway", "Initiating a heavy metal detoxification protocol"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Elevated quinolinic acid suggests imbalances in the kynurenine pathway, often linked to inflammation and neurotoxicity. Addressing inflammation and supporting balanced kynurenine metabolism are key therapeutic goals."
