            "question": "In Functional Medicine history taking, what is the primary focus when exploring a patient's past medical history?",
            "options": ["Documenting all past diagnoses and treatments.", "Identifying root causes and connections between seemingly unrelated symptoms.", "Focusing solely on the most recent medical events.", "Ignoring past history to focus on present symptoms."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional Medicine emphasizes identifying the underlying causes of illness and understanding the interconnectedness of symptoms, rather than simply documenting past events."

        {
            "id": "q1_2",
            "question": "Which of the following is NOT a typical section found in a comprehensive Functional Medicine questionnaire?",
            "options": ["Gastrointestinal health", "Cardiovascular health", "Social and emotional well-being", "Favorite ice cream flavors"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While diet is important, asking about specific food preferences like 'favorite ice cream flavors' is not a standard section in a Functional Medicine questionnaire focused on overall health."

            "id": "q1_3",
            "question": "A 45-year-old client, Sarah, reports chronic fatigue, brain fog, and digestive issues. According to the lesson on lifestyle factors, what initial dietary recommendation would be MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a high-intensity workout routine.", "Recommending a gluten-free and dairy-free elimination diet.", "Suggesting a strict calorie-restricted diet.", "Advising her to ignore her symptoms and continue her current diet."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Given Sarah's symptoms, an elimination diet is a reasonable first step to identify potential food sensitivities contributing to her condition, as discussed in the lifestyle factors lesson."

            "id": "q1_4",
            "question": "According to the lesson on environmental exposures, which of the following is a common source of <span class=\"highlight\">xenoestrogens</span> that could disrupt endocrine function?",
            "options": ["Organic fruits and vegetables", "High-quality air filters", "Plastic food containers", "Natural spring water"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Plastic food containers, especially when heated, can leach xenoestrogens, which are endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen in the body."

            "id": "q1_5",
            "question": "The lesson on emotional and psychological well-being highlighted the impact of chronic stress. Which physiological system is MOST directly affected by prolonged stress, potentially leading to various health issues?",
            "options": ["The skeletal system", "The endocrine system", "The auditory system", "The integumentary system"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Chronic stress significantly impacts the endocrine system, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to hormonal imbalances and various health problems."

        {
            "id": "q1_6",
            "question": "In the Timeline tool, what is the purpose of marking significant life events, such as surgeries, accidents, or major stressors?",
            "options": ["To create a visually appealing patient record.", "To identify potential triggers and connections between past events and current health issues.", "To bill insurance companies more effectively.", "To impress the patient with a detailed history."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Timeline helps identify patterns and connections between past events and the onset of current health problems, revealing potential triggers and contributing factors."

            "id": "q1_7",
            "question": "During a physical examination, which of the following is an example of a functional assessment, as opposed to a standard diagnostic test?",
            "options": ["Measuring blood pressure", "Assessing posture and gait", "Ordering a complete blood count (CBC)", "Performing an X-ray"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Functional assessments, like assessing posture and gait, evaluate the body's movement and function, providing insights into musculoskeletal imbalances and neurological function, while standard tests provide specific diagnostic data."

        {
            "id": "q1_8",
            "question": "A patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. After gathering information, you suspect hypothyroidism. Which step aligns with synthesizing information and developing a problem list?",
            "options": ["Immediately prescribing thyroid medication.", "Ordering only a TSH test.", "Creating a list of potential contributing factors like nutrient deficiencies, stress, and gut health.", "Ignoring the patient's symptoms and focusing on their past medical history."],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Developing a problem list involves identifying potential contributing factors beyond just the primary diagnosis, allowing for a more comprehensive and personalized treatment approach."

            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Case studies and research suggest a significant overlap between chronic fatigue syndrome and IBS, with approximately 70% of patients with chronic fatigue also experiencing IBS symptoms."

            "id": "q1_10",
            "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between the Functional Medicine Matrix and the patient's Timeline?",
            "options": ["The Matrix is used to record billing information, while the Timeline tracks appointment scheduling.", "The Matrix organizes the patient's current symptoms and imbalances, while the Timeline maps the history of events that may have contributed to their condition.", "The Matrix is a more detailed version of the Timeline.", "There is no relationship between the Functional Medicine Matrix and the patient's Timeline."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Matrix provides a snapshot of the patient's current state, while the Timeline offers a historical perspective, allowing practitioners to connect past events with present symptoms and imbalances."
