            "question": "Which of the following best describes the purpose of the Functional Medicine Matrix?",
            "options": ["To diagnose specific diseases based on symptoms.", "To provide a visual representation of the patient's clinical imbalances and interconnectedness.", "To replace traditional medical history taking.", "To prescribe medications based on lab results."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The Functional Medicine Matrix is a visual tool that helps practitioners organize and understand the patient's complex web of interactions among physiological processes, environmental inputs, and genetic predispositions."

        {
            "id": "q2_2",
            "question": "During advanced history taking, a patient reports experiencing bloating, gas, and diarrhea after consuming dairy products. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate follow-up question to uncover hidden clues?",
            "options": ["Do you take any medications for these symptoms?", "Have you ever been tested for lactose intolerance?", "How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?", "Did your mother also have these symptoms?"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Determining the duration of the symptoms helps differentiate between acute and chronic conditions, guiding further investigation into potential root causes and contributing factors."

            "id": "q2_3",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the Gut-Brain Axis lesson, what percentage of serotonin is produced in the gut?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 70%", "Approximately 90%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Research indicates that around 90% of the body's serotonin, a key neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, is produced in the gut, highlighting the importance of gut health for mental well-being."

        {
            "id": "q2_4",
            "question": "A patient presents with chronic fatigue, joint pain, and recurrent infections. Lab results reveal elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Which of the following is the MOST likely underlying issue?",
            "options": ["Hormone imbalance", "Mitochondrial dysfunction", "Chronic inflammation", "Heavy metal toxicity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Elevated CRP and ESR are biomarkers indicative of systemic inflammation, suggesting that chronic inflammation is a significant factor contributing to the patient's symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q2_5",
            "question": "Which of the following hormones is primarily responsible for regulating the sleep-wake cycle?",
            "options": ["Cortisol", "Insulin", "Melatonin", "Thyroid hormone"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms and promoting sleep."

        {
            "id": "q2_6",
            "question": "A patient reports persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, and brain fog. Further testing reveals elevated levels of lactate and pyruvate in the blood. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of these findings?",
            "options": ["Adrenal fatigue", "Mitochondrial dysfunction", "Thyroid disorder", "Vitamin D deficiency"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Elevated lactate and pyruvate levels often indicate impaired mitochondrial function, leading to reduced ATP production and subsequent fatigue and related symptoms."

        {
            "id": "q2_7",
            "question": "Which phase of liver detoxification involves the conjugation of toxins to make them water-soluble for excretion?",
            "options": ["Phase 0", "Phase I", "Phase II", "Phase III"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification involves conjugation reactions, where toxins are bound to other molecules (e.g., glutathione, glucuronic acid) to increase their water solubility and facilitate their elimination from the body."

        {
            "id": "q2_8",
            "question": "A 45-year-old female presents with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Her TSH is elevated, and free T4 is low. Which of the following personalized testing strategies is MOST appropriate?",
            "options": ["Comprehensive stool analysis", "Organic acids test", "Thyroid antibody testing", "Heavy metal toxicity testing"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the symptoms and initial lab results, thyroid antibody testing (e.g., anti-TPO, anti-Tg) is crucial to assess for autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), a common cause of hypothyroidism."

        {
            "id": "q2_9",
            "question": "According to the case study discussed involving 'Sarah,' a 38-year-old with chronic fatigue and digestive issues, which of the following interventions had the MOST significant impact on improving her energy levels and reducing bloating?",
            "options": ["Gluten-free diet", "Probiotic supplementation", "Stress management techniques", "Vitamin B12 injections"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "In the case study, probiotic supplementation, tailored to address Sarah's specific gut dysbiosis identified through comprehensive stool analysis, resulted in the most significant improvement in her energy levels and digestive symptoms."

            "options": ["Advanced history taking", "Physical examination", "Lifestyle assessment", "Prescription of targeted medications"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "While medication may be part of a treatment plan, the 'Evaluate' stage focuses on gathering information and assessing the patient's condition through history, examination, and lifestyle assessment, rather than prescribing medications."
