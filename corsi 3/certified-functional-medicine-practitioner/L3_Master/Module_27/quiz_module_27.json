            "id": "q27_1",
            "question": "In the context of autoimmune disease, which of the following dietary interventions is MOST consistently supported by research as a foundational strategy?",
            "options": ["High-dose vitamin D supplementation", "Strict adherence to the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet", "Elimination of gluten and dairy", "Regular intermittent fasting"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While other options may be beneficial for some, the elimination of gluten and dairy has the strongest evidence base for reducing inflammation and gut permeability in individuals with autoimmune conditions, as discussed in the autoimmune disease lesson. A 2022 meta-analysis in 'Autoimmunity Reviews' supports this."

            "id": "q27_2",
            "question": "A 52-year-old male presents with mild cognitive impairment and a family history of Alzheimer's disease. Which of the following functional medicine approaches would be the MOST appropriate INITIAL step?",
            "options": ["Prescribing a cholinesterase inhibitor", "Implementing a ketogenic diet", "Assessing and addressing gut microbiome imbalances", "Initiating high-intensity interval training"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Addressing gut microbiome imbalances is a critical first step in neurological disorders. The gut-brain axis plays a significant role in neuroinflammation and cognitive function. Addressing gut health can have a broad impact before more targeted interventions are implemented. This aligns with the gut-brain axis protocols discussed."

            "id": "q27_3",
            "question": "According to the lesson on cardiovascular health, what is the primary mechanism by which berberine is thought to improve lipid profiles?",
            "options": ["Directly inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver", "Increasing bile acid sequestrant activity", "Activating AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase)", "Reducing inflammation by inhibiting COX-2 enzymes"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Berberine's primary mechanism of action involves the activation of AMPK, which regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. This was a key point in the cardiovascular health lesson. Studies in the 'Journal of Lipid Research' support this mechanism."

        {
            "id": "q27_4",
            "question": "Which of the following is a hallmark characteristic of metabolic syndrome, as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III)?",
            "options": ["Low HDL cholesterol", "Elevated LDL cholesterol", "Hypotension", "Low triglycerides"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Low HDL cholesterol is one of the key diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome, as outlined by NCEP ATP III. The lesson on metabolic syndrome specifically highlights these diagnostic criteria. Elevated triglycerides, abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose are also defining features."

            "id": "q27_5",
            "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with symptoms of perimenopause, including irregular periods, hot flashes, and mood swings. Which of the following herbal remedies has the strongest evidence for alleviating these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Ginseng", "St. John's Wort", "Black Cohosh", "Valerian Root"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Black cohosh has been shown in multiple studies to effectively reduce hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. While other herbs may offer some benefit, black cohosh has the most robust evidence base, as discussed in the women's health lesson. A 2021 Cochrane review supports this."

            "id": "q27_6",
            "question": "In the context of men's health, what is the primary role of aromatase?",
            "options": ["Converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)", "Converting testosterone to estrogen", "Stimulating the production of testosterone in the testes", "Inhibiting the production of cortisol"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Aromatase is responsible for converting testosterone to estrogen. This process is crucial for hormonal balance in men, and its dysregulation can contribute to various health issues. The men's health lesson covers the importance of aromatase balance for overall vitality."

            "id": "q27_7",
            "question": "A 7-year-old child presents with recurrent ear infections and eczema. Which of the following functional medicine approaches would be MOST appropriate to investigate as a potential root cause?",
            "options": ["Administering antibiotics", "Prescribing topical corticosteroids", "Assessing for food sensitivities and gut dysbiosis", "Recommending allergy shots"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Recurrent ear infections and eczema are often linked to food sensitivities and gut dysbiosis in children. Addressing these underlying factors is a more comprehensive approach than simply treating the symptoms. This aligns with the principles discussed in the pediatric health lesson."

            "id": "q27_8",
            "question": "Which of the following environmental toxins is MOST strongly associated with endocrine disruption and potential reproductive health issues?",
            "options": ["Lead", "Mercury", "Bisphenol A (BPA)", "Arsenic"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine disruptor that can interfere with hormone function and potentially lead to reproductive health problems. The environmental health lesson specifically highlighted the dangers of BPA and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals. A 2023 review in 'Environmental Health Perspectives' details these risks."

            "id": "q27_9",
            "question": "Client Sarah, age 38, presents with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Her initial lab results show elevated TPO antibodies and a slightly elevated TSH. She reports fatigue, weight gain, and constipation. Besides dietary modifications, which supplement would be MOST appropriate to consider FIRST, based on the functional medicine approach?",
            "options": ["Selenium", "Iron", "Vitamin B12", "Magnesium"],
            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Selenium is crucial for thyroid hormone production and has been shown to reduce TPO antibody levels in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Given Sarah's diagnosis and symptoms, selenium would be a prudent first-line supplement. This aligns with the autoimmune and women's health lessons."

            "id": "q27_10",
            "question": "A 60-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction is following a functional medicine protocol. He reports taking a statin prescribed by his cardiologist. Which nutrient is MOST important to monitor and potentially supplement due to statin-induced depletion?",
            "options": ["Vitamin C", "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)", "Vitamin D", "Calcium"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Statins are known to deplete CoQ10, which is essential for mitochondrial function and cardiovascular health. Monitoring and supplementing CoQ10 is crucial for patients on statins to mitigate potential side effects. The cardiovascular health and metabolic syndrome lessons emphasize the importance of CoQ10 in this context."
