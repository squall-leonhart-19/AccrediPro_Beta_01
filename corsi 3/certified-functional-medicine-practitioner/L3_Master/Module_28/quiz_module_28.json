            "options": ["Detailed medical history review", "Assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs)", "Psychological evaluation", "Nutritional assessment"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Immediate stabilization of vital functions (ABCs) takes precedence over other assessments in an acute crisis."

            "id": "q28_2",
            "question": "A patient experiencing a Herxheimer reaction following Lyme disease treatment presents with increased fatigue, muscle aches, and fever. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate to mitigate these symptoms?",
            "options": ["Administering a high dose of antibiotics to eradicate the infection quickly", "Reducing the dosage of the antimicrobial agent and supporting detoxification pathways", "Prescribing an anti-inflammatory medication to suppress the immune response", "Immediately discontinuing all treatment protocols"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Reducing the antimicrobial dosage and supporting detoxification pathways helps to manage the Herxheimer reaction without completely halting treatment, minimizing patient discomfort."

            "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic that distinguishes a complex case from a standard clinical presentation?",
            "options": ["Single, easily identifiable underlying cause", "Multiple interacting systems and contributing factors", "Rapid response to conventional treatment approaches", "Clearly defined treatment protocol with predictable outcomes"],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Complex cases involve intricate interactions between various physiological systems and contributing factors, making them challenging to diagnose and treat."

            "question": "According to the psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) model, which of the following best describes the relationship between psychological stress and immune function?",
            "options": ["Psychological stress invariably enhances immune function.", "Psychological stress has no significant impact on immune function.", "Chronic psychological stress can suppress immune function and increase susceptibility to illness.", "Psychological stress only affects immune function in individuals with pre-existing autoimmune conditions."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Chronic psychological stress is well-documented to suppress immune function via various neuroendocrine pathways, increasing vulnerability to infections and other illnesses."

            "question": "A 45-year-old female client, Sarah, presents with chronic fatigue, digestive issues, and anxiety. Her history reveals exposure to mold in her previous home. Which system should be prioritized for initial assessment in a systems-based approach?",
            "options": ["Cardiovascular system", "Endocrine system", "Immune system", "Musculoskeletal system"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Given the history of mold exposure and the presenting symptoms, the immune system should be prioritized for initial assessment due to its potential involvement in the client's condition."

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Phase II detoxification reactions involve conjugation, and glutathione conjugation is a key process in this phase for eliminating toxins."
