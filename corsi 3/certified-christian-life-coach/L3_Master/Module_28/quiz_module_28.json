            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST accurate definition of a crisis situation in the context of Christian Life Coaching?",
            "options": ["Any significant life change that causes stress.", "A situation exceeding an individual's typical coping mechanisms, threatening their emotional or spiritual well-being.", "A period of intense emotional distress lasting less than 24 hours.", "A situation that requires professional psychological intervention."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "A crisis is defined by exceeding coping mechanisms and threatening well-being, not merely any stress or a short duration. While professional help may be needed, it's not the defining factor."
