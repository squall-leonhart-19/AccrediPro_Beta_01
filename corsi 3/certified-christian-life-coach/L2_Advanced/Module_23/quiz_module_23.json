            "id": "q23_1",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective way to demonstrate advanced active listening in a coaching session, building upon the techniques discussed in L1?",
            "options": ["Nodding and saying 'uh-huh' frequently.", "Summarizing the client's statements and reflecting on the underlying emotions and spiritual implications.", "Asking clarifying questions without pausing.", "Offering immediate advice based on your own experiences."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Summarizing and reflecting on emotions and spiritual implications demonstrates a deeper level of understanding and engagement than simply acknowledging the client's words. This builds trust and encourages deeper exploration."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_2",
            "question": "In L2, we discussed transformational questioning. Which type of question is MOST likely to help a client uncover limiting beliefs?",
            "options": ["Closed-ended questions requiring a 'yes' or 'no' answer.", "Open-ended questions that explore the client's assumptions and perspectives.", "Leading questions that suggest a particular answer.", "Rhetorical questions that don't require an answer."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Open-ended questions encourage clients to think critically about their beliefs and assumptions, making it easier to identify and challenge limiting thought patterns."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_3",
            "question": "According to L3, which Biblical principle is MOST relevant to the process of reframing negative thoughts and cognitive restructuring?",
            "options": ["An eye for an eye.", "Taking every thought captive to obey Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5).", "Do not judge, or you too will be judged.", "Love your neighbor as yourself."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "2 Corinthians 10:5 directly addresses the need to control our thoughts and align them with Christ, providing a spiritual foundation for cognitive restructuring."

        {
            "id": "q23_4",
            "question": "A client, Sarah, states she wants to 'get closer to God.' In L4's advanced goal setting framework, what is the BEST first step to help her define a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goal?",
            "options": ["Encourage her to pray more often.", "Ask her to describe what 'closer to God' means to her in concrete terms.", "Suggest she attend church more regularly.", "Advise her to read the Bible every day."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Defining 'closer to God' in concrete terms helps create a specific and measurable goal. The other options are actions that might contribute, but lack specificity."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_5",
            "question": "Which conflict resolution strategy, discussed in L5, emphasizes understanding the other person's perspective and finding common ground, aligning with Philippians 2:4 ('Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.')?",
            "options": ["Compromise.", "Avoidance.", "Collaboration.", "Competition."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Collaboration focuses on understanding each party's needs and finding solutions that benefit everyone, reflecting the selfless attitude encouraged in Philippians 2:4."

        {
            "id": "q23_6",
            "question": "According to L6, what is the MOST effective way to help a client establish a new spiritual discipline, such as daily prayer, based on habit formation principles?",
            "options": ["Encourage them to pray for at least one hour every day.", "Suggest they find an accountability partner and start with a small, manageable prayer time at the same time each day.", "Advise them to pray whenever they feel like it.", "Tell them to write down all the reasons why prayer is important."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Starting small, using cues (same time each day), and having accountability significantly increases the likelihood of forming a lasting habit, as discussed in L6. Praying for an hour daily is often unrealistic for beginners."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_7",
            "question": "In L7, we discussed discernment of spirits. A client reports feeling overwhelmed by negative thoughts and voices. What is the MOST appropriate initial step for a Christian life coach to take?",
            "options": ["Immediately command the spirits to leave in Jesus' name.", "Refer the client to a qualified mental health professional and encourage prayer and scripture reading.", "Assure the client that it's just their imagination.", "Tell the client to ignore the thoughts and they will go away."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "While spiritual warfare is a reality, it's crucial to prioritize the client's well-being by seeking professional mental health support alongside spiritual practices. This ensures a holistic approach."

        {
            "id": "q23_8",

            "options": ["Praying with the client during sessions.", "Sharing personal experiences that relate to the client's challenges.", "Developing a close personal friendship with the client outside of coaching sessions.", "Referring the client to a trusted therapist or counselor when necessary."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Developing a close personal friendship creates a dual relationship that can compromise objectivity and exploit the power dynamic inherent in the coaching relationship. The other options are generally acceptable or even encouraged."
        },
        {
            "id": "q23_9",
            "question": "A client is struggling to forgive someone who has deeply hurt them. Building upon L3's principles of reframing, which question would be MOST helpful in guiding the client towards forgiveness?",

            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Focusing on the potential positive outcomes of forgiveness encourages the client to reframe the situation and consider the benefits of letting go of resentment. The other options may perpetuate negative feelings."

            "options": ["Avoiding discussing religious topics altogether to prevent further conflict.", "Actively listening to understand the other person's perspective with empathy and seeking common ground based on shared values.", "Assertively defending one's own religious beliefs to convince the other person of their correctness.", "Seeking legal intervention to protect one's rights and ensure fair treatment."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The case study emphasized the importance of empathetic listening and finding common ground, reflecting the Biblical call to understanding and reconciliation, even amidst differing beliefs."
