            "question": "A client reveals during a values clarification exercise that financial success is their top value, but they also express guilt about prioritizing money over spiritual growth. Which ethical principle is MOST directly challenged in this scenario?",
            "options": ["Autonomy", "Beneficence", "Non-maleficence", "Justice"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Non-maleficence, or 'do no harm,' is challenged because the client is experiencing emotional distress (guilt) directly related to their identified value. A coach must be sensitive to this conflict and proceed with care."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_2",
            "question": "According to research discussed in the 'Spiritual Gifts Assessments' lesson, what percentage of individuals are unaware of their dominant spiritual gifts before taking a formal assessment?",
            "options": ["Approximately 10%", "Approximately 30%", "Approximately 50%", "Approximately 70%"],
            "correctAnswer": 3,
            "explanation": "Studies cited in the lesson suggest that around 70% of individuals are not fully aware of their primary spiritual gifts before completing a validated assessment tool. This highlights the value of these assessments in self-discovery."

            "id": "q20_3",
            "question": "Which of the following is the MOST significant limitation to consider when using personality assessments in a Christian coaching context?",
            "options": ["Cost of the assessment", "Time required to administer the assessment", "Potential for cultural bias and misinterpretation", "Lack of scientific validity"],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "While cost and time can be factors, the potential for cultural bias and misinterpretation of personality assessments is the most significant limitation, especially when applying them across diverse populations and within a faith-based framework. Assessments may not adequately capture the nuances of cultural expression or spiritual values."

            "id": "q20_4",
            "question": "In a case study presented, a client named Sarah, age 35, consistently scored high in 'Empathy' on strength-based assessments but felt drained by helping others. Which coaching intervention would be MOST appropriate to explore FIRST?",
            "options": ["Encouraging her to take on more volunteer work to develop her strength.", "Helping her set boundaries and prioritize self-care to avoid burnout.", "Suggesting she re-take the assessment to ensure accuracy.", "Advising her to find a different strength to focus on."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most appropriate initial intervention is to help Sarah establish healthy boundaries and prioritize self-care. This addresses the potential negative impact of overusing her strength and aligns with a holistic coaching approach."

            "correctAnswer": 4,
            "explanation": "The 'Harmony' element of the F.A.I.T.H. Framework™ directly addresses the alignment of a client's strengths, values, and passions with their perceived calling or purpose, fostering a sense of integration and fulfillment."

        {
            "id": "q20_6",
            "question": "A coach interprets a client's high score on an assertiveness scale as indicating a lack of humility. This is an example of which common assessment interpretation pitfall?",

            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "This is an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, where the coach attributes the client's behavior (assertiveness) to their character (lack of humility) rather than considering situational factors or a healthy expression of confidence."

        {
            "id": "q20_7",
            "question": "When creating a personalized assessment plan, what is the primary benefit of starting with a broad values clarification exercise before administering more specific assessments?",
            "options": ["It saves time and resources.", "It provides a foundational understanding of the client's core motivations.", "It guarantees more accurate results on subsequent assessments.", "It is required by ethical coaching guidelines."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "Starting with values clarification provides a crucial foundation by revealing the client's core motivations and priorities, which can then inform the selection and interpretation of more specific assessments. This ensures a more tailored and meaningful assessment process."
        },
        {
            "id": "q20_8",
            "question": "A client expresses skepticism about the validity of spiritual gifts assessments, stating that they believe God can use people in any way He chooses. How should a coach BEST respond?",
            "options": ["Agree and discontinue the assessment.", "Explain the assessment's statistical validity and reliability.", "Acknowledge their perspective while explaining that the assessment can reveal potential areas of giftedness.", "Insist that they complete the assessment to challenge their beliefs."],
            "correctAnswer": 2,
            "explanation": "The best approach is to acknowledge the client's perspective and explain that the assessment is not meant to limit God's possibilities but rather to highlight potential areas of giftedness and strength that the client may not be fully aware of. This respects the client's beliefs while still offering the potential benefits of the assessment."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Administering an assessment to a close family member creates a dual relationship that could compromise objectivity and potentially harm the coaching relationship due to pre-existing dynamics and biases. It is best practice to avoid such situations."

            "id": "q20_10",

            "options": ["Challenge the client's self-perception directly.", "Explore the client's beliefs and past experiences related to self-worth and humility.", "Disregard the client's self-report and focus on objective assessment data.", "Recommend a different assessment tool."],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "The most appropriate initial step is to explore the client's underlying beliefs and past experiences related to self-worth and humility. This allows the coach to understand the reasons behind the client's behavior and address any potential limiting beliefs or negative self-perceptions that may be hindering their self-assessment."
