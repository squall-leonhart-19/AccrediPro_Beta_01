## 👩‍⚕️ Sarah's Persona

**Visual:** Circular avatar (warm, clinical authority) on every screen

**Bio:**
> *"I'm Sarah — a former burned-out ER nurse and single mum who discovered there's a better way to help people heal. The DEPTH Method™ changed everything for me. Let's see if you're ready for it too."*

---

## 🧠 Quiz Positioning (Hormozi Style)

### The Angle:
> *"Do you have what it takes to master the DEPTH Method™ — the clinical framework that separates real practitioners from basic health coaches?"*

### The Promise:
> *"Discover your Practitioner Type and see if you qualify for our Clinical Certification Program"*

### The Psychology:
- **Qualification** — Not everyone gets in
- **Clinical Authority** — This is REAL (not fluffy coaching)
- **Identity Shift** — "Practitioner" not "coach"
- **DEPTH Method™** — Named framework = proprietary value

### PILLAR 1: Clinical Gap Creation
*Goal: Show them why "basic coaching" isn't enough*

---

**Q1.** *"{{NAME}}, have you ever felt frustrated that generic advice — 'eat better, exercise more' — doesn't actually FIX your clients' problems?"*

- 🔥 YES — I see it fail every single day
- 😐 Sometimes — it works for some, not others
- 🤔 I haven't worked with clients yet
- 👀 I'm not sure what you mean

**🔥 REACTION (for "YES"):**
> [👩 Dr. Michelle's photo] *"Dr. Michelle felt the exact same frustration. Now she uses the DEPTH Method™ to find the ROOT CAUSE — and her clients actually get better."*

---

**Q2.** *"When someone comes to you with fatigue, weight gain, or brain fog — do you feel confident identifying the actual ROOT CAUSE?"*

- 😰 No — I feel like I'm guessing most of the time
- 🤷‍♀️ Sometimes — but I wish I had a system
- 🙂 I'm learning, but I want more structure
- ✅ Yes — I already have clinical training

**🔥 REACTION (for "No - guessing"):**
> [👩 Jennifer's photo] *"Jennifer used to guess too. The DEPTH Method™ gave her a 5-phase clinical framework. Now she KNOWS, not guesses."*

---

**Q3.** *"{{NAME}}, what's your biggest frustration with traditional health coaching right now?"*

- 🎭 It feels surface-level — no real clinical depth
- 💸 I can't charge premium prices without credentials
- 📉 My clients don't get lasting results
- 🤯 I don't have a proven system to follow

**🔥 REACTION (for "surface-level"):**
> [👩 Angela's photo] *"Angela said the same thing. 'I felt like a cheerleader, not a clinician.' The DEPTH Method™ changed that completely."*

**Progress Bar:** 30%

---

### 💬 TESTIMONIAL #1 (Authority Building)

>
> *[Verified DEPTH Practitioner ✓]*

---

### PILLAR 2: DEPTH Method™ Introduction
*Goal: Make them want the framework before they know the price*

---

**Q4.** *"The DEPTH Method™ is our 5-phase clinical framework: **D**iscover, **E**valuate, **P**inpoint, **T**ransform, **H**eal. Does having a systematic approach appeal to you?"*

- 🔥 Absolutely — I need structure
- 👍 Yes — systems help me feel confident
- 🤔 Maybe — tell me more

---

**Q6.** *"{{NAME}}, what would it mean for your career if you could confidently interpret labs, design clinical protocols, and charge $75-$200/hour?"*

- 🤔 I'm not sure I could get there

**🔥 REACTION (for "Everything"):**

>
> *[Verified DEPTH Practitioner ✓]*

---

### PILLAR 3: Readiness Assessment
*Goal: Make sure they're serious — and make them FEEL serious*

---

**Q7.** *"{{NAME}}, have you invested in health certifications before?"*

- 💸 Yes — but they were too expensive and took too long
- 📚 Yes — but they lacked clinical depth

- 🤷‍♀️ I've done free courses only

**🔥 REACTION (for "expensive/took too long"):**

- ⏳ Programs take years
- 💸 Programs cost $10K+
- 🫤 I don't feel "ready" or "qualified"
- 👥 I don't know how to get clients

**🔥 REACTION (based on answer — handles objection):**

|--------|----------|
| Takes years | *"The DEPTH Method™ takes 30 days. Not 3 years. Real clinical skills, real speed."* |
| Costs $10K+ | *"Most practitioners paid less than $100 — not $10,000. Same skills, different investment."* |
| Don't feel ready | *"Feeling 'not ready' is exactly why you NEED the framework. It gives you confidence."* |
| No clients | *"We include the Business Setup System. First 3 clients in week 1 is common."* |

**Progress Bar:** 70%
