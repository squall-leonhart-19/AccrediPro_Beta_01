================================================================================
STEP 1: INTRO (Sarah's Qualification Framing)
================================================================================
Badge: "See If You Qualify"

Title: "Hey sweet friend — I'm Sarah. 💕"

Body Copy:
"Our certification cohorts are *small on purpose*. I personally follow every 
student through the journey — so I can only accept people who are genuinely ready.

This short application helps me understand:
  ✨ Where you're coming from
  💭 What's been holding you back
  🌟 What you're hoping to build

Takes about 3 minutes. No payment info. No commitment.

I'll personally review what you share and reach out within 24-48 hours to let 
you know if you qualify for our next cohort."

================================================================================
STEP 2: BACKGROUND (Checkbox - Multiple Select)
================================================================================
Title: "What's your background, sweet friend?"
Subtitle: "Check everything that applies"

Sarah Text: "There's no \"right\" background for this work. I've had the joy 
of working with women from every path imaginable. 💕"

Options:
  🩺 Nurse (RN, LPN, NP)
  ⚕️ Other healthcare professional  
  🧘 Wellness/fitness/nutrition
  💼 A completely different field

================================================================================
STEP 3: MOTIVATION (Radio - Single Select)
================================================================================
Title: "What actually brought you here today?"
Subtitle: "Be real with me — I've heard it all, and lived most of it myself."

Options:
  💔 My own health struggles led me here
  🔥 Burned out and craving something meaningful
  🔍 Been researching... finally ready
  💕 I want to help women like me
  👋 Someone I trust mentioned this
  ✨ Something just felt right

================================================================================
STEP 4: HEALTH JOURNEY (Radio - Single Select)
================================================================================
Title: "Have you dealt with health challenges traditional medicine couldn't fully solve?"

Sarah Text: "So many of us came to functional medicine because we had to. 
Our bodies forced us to find another way. 🌿"

Options:
  😔 Yes — hormones, gut, fatigue, autoimmune... I've been through it
  😐 Somewhat — I've had struggles but managed
  💔 I've watched someone I love struggle
  🌟 Not really — drawn for other reasons

================================================================================
STEP 5: TIME AVAILABILITY (Radio - Single Select)
================================================================================
Title: "What's realistic for you in terms of time?"

Sarah Text: "Our program is designed for real women with real lives. 
Not people with unlimited free time. ⏰"

Options:
  ⏰ A few hours a week if this is right
  📅 5-10 hours a week to dedicate
  💪 I could really commit right now
  🔄 Life is unpredictable — need flexibility

================================================================================
STEP 6: DREAM OUTCOME (Textarea - Open Response)
================================================================================
Title: "90 days from now... certified and helping women heal..."
Subtitle: "What would that change for you?"

Sarah Text: "Close your eyes for a second. What would your days look like? 
How would you feel waking up? What would be different?

Take your time with this one. It matters. ✨"

Placeholder: "Take a moment to imagine... even a few words helps me understand 
you better..."

================================================================================
STEP 7: TIMING (Radio - Single Select)
================================================================================
Title: "If everything felt right, when would you want to begin?"

Options:
  🚀 Honestly? I've been waiting for this. I'm ready. [HIGHLIGHTED]
  📆 Soon — within the next few weeks
  🤔 I'd need a little time to prepare
  ❓ Depends on what I learn

================================================================================

Subtitle: "Where should I send your results?"

Fields:
  - First Name * (required)
  - Last Name (optional)
  - Email * (required)
  - Phone (optional)

Sarah Text: "I personally read every single application. This goes directly 
to me — not a bot, not a VA. Just me, with a cup of tea, genuinely wanting 
to know if we're a fit."

================================================================================
STEP 9: COMMITMENTS (Final Confirmation)
================================================================================
Title: "One more thing, sweet friend..."

Sarah Text: "I keep our certification groups small. Intentionally. Because I 
personally follow every single student through this journey.

That only works if I protect the intimacy of each cohort.

So when you submit this, know that I'm treating it seriously. And I hope 
you are too. 💕"

Checkboxes (all required):
  ☐ I understand the cohort size is limited
  ☐ I'm serious about helping women — and earning real income doing it
