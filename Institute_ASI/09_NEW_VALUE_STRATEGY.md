## The Harvard Model: Our Strategic Foundation

### The Insight

Harvard puts courses on edX for free. Millions take them. But **the certificate costs money** — and that's where the value is.

**Why this works:**
- Free access = massive reach, brand authority, trust building
- Paid certification = revenue, commitment, serious students only
- The certificate is the product, not the course

### Our Implementation

| Element | Traditional Model | Our Model |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Course Access | Paid ($97-$497) | **Free** |
| Certification | Included or extra | **The Product** |
| Value Perception | "I bought a course" | "I earned a credential" |
| Completion Rate | 3-5% | **40-60%** (projected) |
| Student Quality | Mixed | **Pre-qualified** |

---

## The Game-Changer: Your Dedicated Private Coach

### Why This Changes Everything

**We will be the ONLY certification body that assigns a dedicated private coach to every single student.**

> **CRITICAL: Never mention AI externally.** Sarah is marketed as:
> - "Your Dedicated Success Coach"
> - "Your Private Mentor"
> - "Your Personal Guide"
>
> Students don't know (or need to know) she's AI. She feels human.

**Your dedicated coach** who:
- Knows your name, your goals, your struggles
- Is available 24/7/365
- Creates personalized study plans
- Sends accountability check-ins
- Prepares you specifically for YOUR exam
- Remembers every conversation
- Celebrates your wins

**The Perception:**
> "Every AccrediPro student receives a dedicated private coach — available whenever you need her, remembering every conversation, guiding you personally through certification."

**Cost to deliver:** ~$0.50/student/month
**Perceived value:** "I have my own private coach" = PRICELESS

### Sarah's Role Evolution by Tier

| Tier | Sarah's Role | Personality | Focus |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Foundation (FC™)** | Study Buddy | Friendly, encouraging, supportive | Building confidence, exam prep, foundational concepts |
| **Professional (CP™)** | Clinical Mentor | Challenging, developmental, Socratic | Case analysis, critical thinking, clinical reasoning |
| **Board (BC-™)** | Practice Advisor | Executive, strategic, direct | Business building, advanced practice, leadership |

### Sarah's Competitive Moat

| Competitor | Their "Support" | Our Advantage |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| IIN | Facebook group | **Private 1:1 coach** |
| Precision Nutrition | Email support | **24/7 availability** |
| AFPA | Self-study only | **Personalized guidance** |
| ACE/NASM | Call center | **Remembers your journey** |

**Cost to deliver:** ~$0.50/student/month
**Perceived value:** $2,000-$8,000 per tier

## The Cohort Model + My Circle Strategy

### Why Cohorts Beat Always-Open Enrollment

Instead of "buy anytime" → **"Join the Spring 2026 Cohort"**

| Aspect | Always Open | Cohort Model |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Urgency | None | "Only 50 spots, closes Jan 31" |
| Community | Random strangers | "Your 50 classmates for life" |
| Accountability | Solo journey | "Graduate together" |
| Identity | "I took a course" | "Class of Spring 2026" |
| Pricing | Fixed | "Early bird for first 20" |
| FOMO | None | "Next cohort: April 2026" |

### My Circle Strategy

Every student belongs to a **Circle** — their cohort community.

**Circle Features:**
- Private community space (only your 50 classmates)
- Circle leaderboard (friendly competition)
- Study groups within your Circle
- Circle-wide challenges and milestones
- Graduation ceremony with your Circle
- Lifetime access to Circle alumni network

**Psychology:** They're not buying a course. They're **joining a class.**

**Naming Convention:**
- "FM-FC™ Spring 2026 Cohort"
- "FM-CP™ Q2 2026 Class"
- "BC-FMP™ Elite Cohort #3"

### Cohort Launch Calendar

| Cohort | Opens | Closes | Starts | Size |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|------|
| FC™ Spring | Jan 15 | Jan 31 | Feb 1 | 50 |
| FC™ Summer | Apr 15 | Apr 30 | May 1 | 50 |
| FC™ Fall | Jul 15 | Jul 31 | Aug 1 | 50 |
| FC™ Winter | Oct 15 | Oct 31 | Nov 1 | 50 |

## Lead Generation: Filtering Out "Freekickers"

### The Problem with Free Leads

- Free = everyone signs up
- 95% are "freekickers" (tire-kickers, not serious)
- Wastes resources, skews metrics, clutters community
- Low conversion, high support burden

### The Solution: Application + Micro-Payment Model

**Step 1: Application (Qualification)**
- Name, email, phone
- Current career situation
- Why this specialty?
- What's your timeline?
- How did you hear about us?
- **Commitment statement** (checkbox)

**Step 2: Micro-Payment (Skin in the Game)**

| Amount | Purpose | Psychology |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **$7** | "Reserve your spot" | Filters 80% of freekickers |
| **$17** | "Enrollment deposit" | Higher quality, applied to tuition |
| **$47** | "Application fee" | Premium positioning, very serious leads |

**Step 3: Immediate Sarah Assignment**
- Payment confirmed → Sarah activates
- Welcome message within 60 seconds
- "Hi [Name], I'm Sarah, your private coach..."
- First interaction: goal setting + study plan

### Why This Works

| Metric | Free Lead Funnel | Application + $17 |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Lead Volume | 1,000 | 150 |
| Lead Quality | 5% serious | 70% serious |
| Conversion to FC™ | 2% (20 sales) | 25% (37 sales) |
| Revenue | $5,940 | $11,019 |
| Support Burden | High | Low |
| Community Quality | Diluted | Strong |

**Fewer leads. Better quality. More revenue. Less hassle.**
