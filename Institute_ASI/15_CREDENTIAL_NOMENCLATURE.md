| Nutrition Coaching | NC |
| Autism & ADHD | AA |
| Stress & HPA | SH |

| Tier | Code | Position |
|------|------|----------|
| Foundation Certified | FC | After specialty |
| Certified Professional | CP | After specialty |
| Board Certified | BC- | Before specialty |

### Why BC and MC Come BEFORE Specialty?

Following medical convention:

This positioning conveys authority and aligns with professional expectations.

- **™** = Trademark (can use immediately)
- **®** = Registered trademark (requires USPTO registration)

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Can someone skip tiers?**

A: No. The path is linear and sequential:
- FC™ required before CP™
- CP™ + client hours required before BC-™
- BC-™ + years of practice required before MC-™

**Q: Can someone hold credentials in multiple specialties?**

A: Yes! Many practitioners hold credentials across specialties:
- FM-CP™ + GH-FC™ (Professional in FM, Foundation in Gut Health)
- BC-FMP™ + BC-WHP™ (Board Certified in both FM and Women's Health)

**Q: Do credentials expire?**

A:
- FC™ and CP™: No expiration (but can become inactive)
- BC-™: Annual renewal required ($197/year + 20 CE credits)
- MC-™: Annual renewal required (included in Board membership)

**Q: What happens if someone doesn't renew BC-™?**

A: Credential becomes "Inactive." They cannot use the designation until renewal. After 2 years inactive, re-examination may be required.

---

### Naming Questions

**Q: Why "Practitioner" for Board/Master but "Professional" for CP?**

A:
- **"Professional"** = Someone who does it for money (entry professional level)
- **"Practitioner"** = Someone who practices at a clinical level (advanced connotation)

Board and Master levels imply clinical expertise, hence "Practitioner."

**Q: Why does "Board Certified" come before the specialty?**

A: Medical convention. Doctors say "Board Certified in Cardiology" — the board designation takes precedence.

**Q: Why does "Certified" come first in CP™ but last in FC™?**

A:
- **FC™:** "Foundation Certified" = You completed the foundation (past tense, learning)
- **CP™:** "Certified Professional" = You ARE certified (present tense, active credential)

The word order emphasizes what's most important at each level.

---

### Legal Questions

**Q: Is the ™ legally protected?**

A: The ™ symbol indicates a claim to trademark. For full legal protection:
1. File trademark applications with USPTO (United States)
2. Register with relevant bodies in UAE/Dubai
3. Consider international trademark protection (Madrid Protocol)

**Q: Can we prevent others from using similar names?**

A: Once registered (®), yes. Trademark registration provides legal protection against:
- Identical marks
- Confusingly similar marks
- Marks in related industries

**Q: Should we trademark each specialty or just the tier structure?**

A: Recommended approach:
1. Trademark the tier structure (FC™, CP™, BC-™, MC-™)
2. Trademark flagship credentials (FM-FC™, FM-CP™, BC-FMP™, MC-FMP™)
3. Additional specialties as budget allows
