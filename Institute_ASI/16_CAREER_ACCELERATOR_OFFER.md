# ASI Career Accelerator — Official Offer Specification

> AccrediPro Standards Institute
> Board-Approved Hormozi-Style Offer
> Version 1.0 | January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The ASI Career Accelerator is a 12-month career transformation program that takes someone from zero to $10K/month practitioner. Following Alex Hormozi's value stacking principles, we've created an offer so compelling that $4,997 feels like stealing.

**Core Promise:** "From Zero to $10K/Month Practitioner in 12 Months — Guaranteed"

---

## The Hormozi Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

| Factor | How We Maximize |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Dream Outcome** | "$10K/month practitioner" — clear, specific, desirable |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | Income guarantee + 3 credentials + DFY = "they'll MAKE me succeed" |
| **Time Delay** | 12 months, BUT first paying client in 90 days |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | DFY removes 80% of work. Sarah AI does the heavy lifting. |

## The Math for Buyers

### Conservative Scenario
```
After 12 months: $5K/month income
Year 2 annual income: $60,000
Investment: $4,997
ROI: 1,100%
```

### Target Scenario
```
After 12 months: $10K/month income
Year 2 annual income: $120,000
Investment: $4,997
ROI: 2,300%
```

### Ambitious Scenario
```
After 12 months: $15K/month income
Year 2 annual income: $180,000
Investment: $4,997
ROI: 3,500%
```

**Objection Response:**
> "But $5K is a lot of money..."

"You're investing $5K to make $120K. That's 24x return. If I offered you a stock that returned 24x, would you buy it? This is better — because YOU control the outcome."

---

## Why This Offer is a No-Brainer

### 1. Board Certification INCLUDED
Competitors charge $5K+ extra for board certification. We include it because we want you to reach the highest level.

### 2. Second Track FREE
Get certified in TWO specializations for the price of one. Dual-certified practitioners earn 40-60% more.

### 3. DFY Everything
You don't have to figure out websites, tech, marketing. We build it FOR you. Just show up and learn.

### 4. Income Guarantee
All risk is on us. If you don't hit $10K/month, we keep working with you FREE until you do.

### 5. Founding Practitioner Status
First 100 get permanent recognition. This badge will mean something as ASI grows.

### 6. AI Coach Lifetime
Sarah doesn't disappear after 12 months. She's yours forever. That's ongoing support worth $2K+/year.

---

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"
"Let's do the math. You invest $5K. You make $10K/month by month 12. That's $120K/year. Your investment pays for itself in 2 weeks of that income. And if you DON'T hit $10K, we keep working with you free. What's the downside?"

### "I don't have time"
"You need 5-10 hours per week. That's one hour per day. If you can't find one hour a day for your future career, this might not be for you. But if you can, you'll have a $10K/month business in 12 months."

### "I'm not sure I can do this"
"That's exactly why we built this program. Sarah coaches you daily. Mentors meet with you weekly. Your pod holds you accountable. The DFY removes the hard parts. You literally just have to show up and follow the path."

### "What if it doesn't work for me?"
"That's why we have the income guarantee. If you do the work and don't hit $10K/month, we keep supporting you FREE until you do. We only make money when you succeed."

### "I need to think about it"
"I understand. But the Founding Practitioner bonus is only for the first 100. And the fast-action bonuses expire in 48 hours. What specifically do you need to think about? Let me address that right now."
