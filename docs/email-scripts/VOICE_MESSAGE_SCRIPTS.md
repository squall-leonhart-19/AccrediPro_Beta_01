# Voice Message Scripts for Sarah

These are the 6 voice messages Sarah needs to record. Each should sound warm, personal, and conversational - like a friend leaving a voice note, NOT a polished ad.

**Recording Tips:**
- Record in a quiet room with good acoustics
- Speak naturally, with emotion - it's okay to pause, laugh, or show warmth
- Imagine you're talking to ONE person who just joined
- Don't rush - pauses are okay
- Save as MP3, 128kbps, mono is fine

**Filename:** `sarah-welcome.mp3`
**Duration:** ~45 seconds
**Trigger:** Immediately after registration

### Script:

> "Hey! It's Sarah. I just wanted to pop in and say... I'm SO excited you're here.
>
> I know how it feels to take that first step toward something new. It can feel exciting and a little scary at the same time, right?
>
> Well, I want you to know — you're not alone on this journey. I'm going to be right here with you, every step of the way.
>
> Your Mini Diploma is waiting for you inside, and I can't wait to see what you think. Take your time, go at your own pace, and don't hesitate to message me if you have any questions.
>
> I believe in you. Talk soon!"

## 2. GRADUATE TRAINING NUDGE (Day 5)
**Filename:** `sarah-graduate-training.mp3`
**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Trigger:** Day 5, or after Mini Diploma completion (whichever comes first)

### Script:

> "Hey, it's Sarah again!
>
> I wanted to check in and see how your Mini Diploma is going. Have you had a chance to dive in yet?
>
> If you've finished it — amazing! I'm so proud of you.
>
> And if you haven't started yet, that's okay too. Life gets busy. Just pick it back up whenever you can.
>
> Either way, I wanted to tell you about something I created called the Graduate Training. It's a 45-minute session where I show you exactly what's possible with functional medicine — the real success stories, the income potential, and what it actually takes to become a certified practitioner.
>
> It's completely free, and I think it'll really help you see the bigger picture.
>
> Just head to your dashboard and look for 'Graduate Training.' I'll see you there!"

## 3. MINI DIPLOMA COMPLETION CELEBRATION (After Mini Diploma Complete)
**Filename:** `sarah-mini-diploma-complete.mp3`
**Duration:** ~90 seconds
**Trigger:** When user completes Mini Diploma course

### Script:

> "Oh my gosh, you did it! You finished your Mini Diploma!
>
> I am SO proud of you right now. Seriously. Do you know how many people download a freebie and never even open it? But you — you showed up. You did the work. You completed it.
>
> That tells me something about you. You're not just curious... you're committed.
>
> So here's what I want you to think about:
>
> What you just learned? That's just a tiny taste of what's possible. The full certification goes SO much deeper — into the protocols, the client work, the real transformation you can create for people.
>
> I've seen students just like you go from where you are now... to helping real clients... to building income that gives them freedom.
>
> And I really believe that could be you too.
>
> Take some time to celebrate what you just accomplished. Then, when you're ready, come check out the full certification program. I'll be here waiting to welcome you in.
>
> You've got this. Talk soon!"

## 4. OBJECTION HANDLING - INVESTMENT (Day 20)
**Filename:** `sarah-investment-talk.mp3`
**Duration:** ~120 seconds
**Trigger:** Day 20 of sequence, or when user visits pricing page multiple times

### Script:

> "Hey, it's Sarah. I wanted to have a real talk with you for a second.
>
> I know $997 is a real investment. It's not nothing. And if you're sitting there wondering if you can afford it, or if it's worth it, or if you're crazy for even considering it... I get it.
>
> When I first invested in my own training, I was terrified. I was a single mom. Every dollar mattered. I remember thinking, 'What if this doesn't work? What if I fail?'
>
> But here's what I've learned since then:
>
> The cost of staying stuck is so much higher than the cost of taking a chance on yourself.
>
> Think about it: What's another year of feeling unfulfilled worth? What's another year of wondering 'what if' worth?
>
> Our students earn back their investment with their first one or two clients. And then everything after that is pure profit.
>
> Plus, we have payment plans if that helps. And a 30-day money-back guarantee. So really, the only risk is... not trying.
>
> I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to tell you that I believe in you. And if you're ready to believe in yourself too... I'll see you on the inside.
>
> Message me if you have any questions. I'm here."

## 5. URGENCY - LAST FEW DAYS (Day 27)
**Filename:** `sarah-last-days.mp3`
**Duration:** ~90 seconds
**Trigger:** Day 27, when enrollment window is closing

### Script:

> "Hey, it's Sarah, and I just wanted to give you a heads up.
>
> We're closing enrollment in just a few days, and I didn't want you to miss it.
>
> I know I've sent you a lot of emails. I know you've probably been thinking about this. And I know sometimes it's easier to just... wait.
>
> But here's the thing: waiting doesn't change anything. The same questions you have today, you'll still have next month. The only difference is, you'll have lost more time.
>
> I've seen so many people reach out after enrollment closes, saying 'I knew I should have just done it.'
>
> I don't want that to be you.
>
> If something's holding you back, message me. Let's talk about it. If it's money, we have payment plans. If it's time, the program is self-paced. If it's fear... well, that's normal. Do it scared.
>
> The door is open right now. All you have to do is walk through it.
>
> I'll be here waiting to welcome you in."

**Duration:** ~60 seconds
**Trigger:** Day 30, enrollment closing day

### Script:

>
> I'm not going to give you a big speech. You already know everything you need to know.
>
> You know this could change your life. You know you're meant for more than where you are right now. You know that helping people with their health is your calling.
>
> The only question is: Are you ready to act on what you already know?
>
> If the answer is yes... I'll see you on the inside.
>
> If not... that's okay too. But don't wait forever. Life is too short to keep putting your dreams on hold.
>
> Whatever you decide, I believe in you.
>
> Talk soon."

## Notes for Sarah

- Be yourself! Your authenticity is what connects with people
- It's okay to deviate slightly from the script if it feels more natural
- If you make a mistake, just pause and re-say the sentence
- The goal is to sound like a friend, not a salesperson
- These messages are powerful because they feel PERSONAL
