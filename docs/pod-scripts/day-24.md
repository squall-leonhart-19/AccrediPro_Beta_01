## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

OMG YOU GUYS

someone just filled out my contact form asking about my services!! 

it's a woman who's been struggling with fatigue and digestive issues for years. she found my site through a Facebook post I made in a health group

my hands are literally shaking. what do I say?? how do I not mess this up??

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 45 min

Denise DON'T PANIC!! 🎉

this is so exciting!! your first real inquiry!!

just be yourself. ask about her health journey, what she's tried before, what her goals are. let her talk. listen

you know this stuff. you're certified. you got this

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 2 hr

Denise this is EXACTLY what we set your site up to do!! 💕

here's what I want you to remember:

1. She's reaching out because she SAW something on your site that resonated
2. She's LOOKING for help - you're not convincing her of anything
3. Your job is just to understand her situation and see if you're a fit

don't try to be perfect. just be present, curious, and caring

you've got the discovery call script I gave you. trust it

let me know how it goes! 🌿
