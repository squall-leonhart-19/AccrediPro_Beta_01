## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Gina (VA #1) — post at 0 min

you guys... I just had my first real paying client consultation!! 🎉

I cannot believe this is actually happening

she found me through a friend of a friend who knew I was studying functional medicine. she's been dealing with digestive issues for years and was SO ready for a different approach

I was honestly terrified going in but once we started talking it just clicked? like all the stuff I learned in the modules actually came out of my mouth lol

she signed on for a 3-month package and I'm still shaking

### Amber (VA #1) — post after 40 min

GINA!! that's incredible!!! 🎉🎉

your first paying client!! this is huge

how much did you charge if you don't mind sharing? I have no idea how to price anything

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 25 min

wait this is amazing!! congrats Gina!! 🎉

also super curious how this happened. like did you reach out to her or did she come to you?

I literally have no idea how to even start getting clients

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 50 min

thanks you guys 💕

so it happened kind of randomly. I mentioned to some friends that I was getting certified and one of them told her coworker about me

for pricing I charged $250 for the initial consultation (90 mins) and then $1200 for the 3-month program (which includes follow-up calls and email support)

honestly I almost didn't charge that much because it felt like "a lot" but Sarah had told us not to undervalue ourselves so I went for it

and she said yes without even hesitating??

so yeah. $1450 total for my first ever client. still processing this lol

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 15 min

GINA this warms my heart!! 💕

first client is always the scariest. and look - she didn't hesitate at your price because you're offering REAL VALUE

$1450 for helping someone finally solve years of digestive issues? that's a steal honestly

this is only the beginning. you should be SO proud 🌿
