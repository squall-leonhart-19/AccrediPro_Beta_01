## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

trying to figure out how to actually start my practice and I'm drowning 😭

websites?? payment processors?? email lists?? booking software??

I watched like 5 YouTube videos on building a website and now I'm more confused than when I started

I literally just want to help people with their health. why is all this tech stuff so complicated

---

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 1 hr 10 min

Denise this is literally my nightmare

I keep pushing it to the back of my mind like "I'll figure it out later" but every time I think about actually LAUNCHING something I freeze

the clinical stuff feels easy compared to all this business/tech chaos

---

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 2 hr 25 min

same here honestly

I'm still in the modules but I keep wondering how I'm supposed to learn functional medicine AND figure out how to run a business at the same time

it's a lot

---

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 3 hr 40 min

real talk... I felt the same way

I spent like 3 weeks trying to build my own website and it looked terrible. then another week figuring out how to set up payment stuff

eventually I just asked Sarah if there was a faster way and she helped me figure it out

there's definitely a shortcut but it took me way too long to find it lol

---

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 5 hr

you guys I hear this ALL the time 💕

here's the thing: you became a health coach because you want to help people heal. not because you love building websites or setting up email automations

for some people, figuring out the tech themselves works. for others, it becomes a BLOCK that stops them from ever helping anyone

I do work with some students more closely to handle this stuff so they can just focus on what they're good at. we can talk more if you're interested

but either way, please don't let tech overwhelm stop you. you're too talented for that 🌿
