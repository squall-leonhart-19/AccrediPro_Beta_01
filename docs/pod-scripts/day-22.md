### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

MY WEBSITE IS OFFICIALLY LIVE 🎉🎉🎉

booking system works. email sequences set up. payment processor connected. everything

I shared it with my friends and family and they were like "this looks so professional"

one week ago I was crying over Squarespace tutorials. now I have a REAL business setup

I'm actually ready to start getting clients now. like for real

this is insane

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 55 min

Denise I just stalked your site and WOW it looks incredible

the way your story is written, the services section, everything flows so well

there's no way I could make something like that myself

I think I need to DM Sarah too... 😅

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 2 hr 10 min

not gonna lie I'm super jealous lol

Denise you look like you've been doing this for years and it's literally been a week

I keep telling myself I'll figure it out on my own but watching everyone get results makes me feel like I'm just wasting time

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 3 hr 35 min

congrats Denise!! 🎉

I remember when my site went live - suddenly everything felt REAL

now the fun part begins: actually helping people!!

---

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 50 min

Denise watching your journey is incredible!! 💕

you went from certified but stuck to having a complete practice setup in 2 weeks. that's exactly what the DFY program is designed to do

now you can focus on what matters: helping people transform their health

the first client is coming. I can feel it 🌿
