## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

okay something shifted this week

I was going pretty slow before but suddenly everything is clicking? like I finished 3 modules in the last 4 days which is way more than I was doing before

I think once you understand the foundations the rest just makes more sense

also I might be slightly addicted to learning this stuff now lol I keep telling my husband random facts about gut bacteria and he's like "please stop" 😅

anyone else hit this point where it just flows?

### Amber (VA #1) — post after 1 hr 25 min

YES Denise!! that happened to me too around Module 5-6

something just clicks and suddenly you're flying through it. love seeing this!!

also your poor husband lol mine is the same. he knows more about inflammation than he ever wanted to 😂

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 50 min

this is exactly what happened to me!

the first few modules felt slow because you're learning a whole new framework. but once it clicks, everything builds on itself

Denise you're gonna be done before you know it 🎉

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 15 min  

Denise this makes my day!! 💕

that "click" moment is real. it's when all the pieces start connecting and suddenly you're not just memorizing - you're UNDERSTANDING

your husband sounds like a saint lol. mine now knows way too much about the microbiome 😅

keep that momentum going! you're doing amazing 🌿
