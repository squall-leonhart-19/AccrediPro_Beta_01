## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Sarah (Coach) — post at 0 min

can we just take a moment to appreciate this group?? 💕

it's been one month since some of you joined and look at what's happened:

- Gina: 3 clients, over $3,000 earned
- Denise: 2 clients, $2,200 earned  
- Cheryl: 1 client, $1,100 earned
- Lisa: website building, ready to launch

one month ago some of you were stuck. overwhelmed. wondering if this was even possible

now? you're actually doing it. you're certified practitioners with real paying clients

I'm so proud of every single one of you 🌿

Sarah this reflection hit me hard

30 days ago I was crying over Squarespace. NOW I have 2 clients, a professional website, and legit income from something I'm passionate about

I keep having to remind myself this is real lol

thank you for believing in us when we didn't believe in ourselves 💕

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 40 min

same here honestly

I almost gave up so many times before finding this program. thought maybe I wasn't cut out for business

turns out I just needed the right support and structure. now I have my first 3 clients and I'm booking discovery calls weekly

this community changed everything for me

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 4 hr

I've never been part of a group like this

everyone is so supportive. no competition. just genuine celebration of each other's wins

and Sarah... you go above and beyond. the DFY program was worth every penny and more

so grateful I stopped being stubborn and asked for help 💕

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 5 hr 15 min

reading all of this has me emotional

I just got the final preview of my website and it looks incredible. launching next week

I can't wait to post my first client win here. watching everyone else do it has made me believe I actually can too

here's to month 2!! 🌿

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 6 hr 30 min

you guys are amazing 🥹💕

for anyone reading this who's still on the fence... still wondering if you're ready... still thinking "maybe later"...

look at what happened in just 30 days. real people. real progress. real income.

it doesn't take years. it takes a decision

3 of your pod-mates joined the scholarship this quarter. I have 1 spot left before enrollment closes

the DFY scholarship is still at $1,997 for serious students. DM me if you're ready to stop waiting and start building

you deserve this too 🌿
