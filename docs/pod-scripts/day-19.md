## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

so... I just enrolled in Sarah's DFY program 😬🎉

I was up until midnight thinking about it and finally just went for it

here's my logic: I already spent months getting certified. I can either spend another 3-6 months fumbling around trying to figure out tech and marketing... or I can just START

I'm nervous about the investment but honestly more nervous about wasting another year not doing anything with my certification

wish me luck!! 💕

### Amber (VA #1) — post after 45 min

DENISE YES!! I'm thrilled for you!! 🎉

this is such a big step. you're actually DOING it not just thinking about it

can't wait to see you with actual clients!!

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 1 hr 55 min

congrats Denise!!

can I ask what made you decide to go for it? I'm still on the fence and curious what pushed you over

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 3 hr 20 min

honestly Cheryl it was Gina's story that did it for me

she said she was stuck for weeks trying to do it herself and then once Sarah helped her she had a client within a month

I don't want to be stuck for weeks. I'm already certified. I'm ready to help people. I just need the stuff set up

plus $1997 sounds like a lot until you realize one client at $1000+ pays for half of it. two clients and I'm profitable

that math made sense to me

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 40 min

Denise I'm over the moon to work with you!! 💕

we're going to build something amazing together. you already have the knowledge and the heart - now we just add the structure

welcome to the DFY family! your website build starts this week 🌿

## PSYCHOLOGY NOTES:

✅ **Real person bought** = social proof
✅ **ROI math** = logical justification
✅ **"Wasting another year"** = urgency
✅ **Explains decision** = handles objections
✅ **"This week"** = immediate action
