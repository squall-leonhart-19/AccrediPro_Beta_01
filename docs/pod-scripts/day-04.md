## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Sarah (Coach) — post at 0 min

happy weekend everyone! 🌿

just checking in - how's everyone doing? making progress? taking a break? both are totally valid lol

I usually use weekends to review what I learned during the week. sometimes things click differently the second time

what are you all working on?

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 30 min

making progress!! just finished Module 3 on gut health basics and honestly mind blown

I've had IBS for years and never connected it to anything else going on with my body. now I'm looking at my whole health differently

also taking notes like crazy because I know I'm gonna forget stuff lol

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 3 hr

trying to catch up a bit this weekend! fell behind a little because work was crazy this week

but honestly even going slow I'm learning so much. did anyone else highlight literally everything in the inflammation module or just me 😅

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 45 min

Denise connecting your IBS to the bigger picture is exactly what this is about 💕 you're getting it!

Lisa going slow is totally fine! this isn't a race. better to really understand it than rush through and forget everything

you're both doing great. keep going 🌿
