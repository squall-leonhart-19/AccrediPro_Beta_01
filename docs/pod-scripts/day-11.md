## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Amber (VA #1) — post at 0 min

ugh can I vent for a second

I've been flying through this program and suddenly hit Module 10 on detoxification and my brain just... stopped working?? 

like I've read the same section 3 times and I still don't fully get how the liver phases connect

not sure if I'm just tired or if this is actually harder than the other modules

anyone else hit a wall at some point?

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 20 min

Amber YES the detox module was hard for me too!!

I think because there's so much biochemistry involved? like phase 1 and phase 2 pathways and all the enzymes and cofactors

what helped me was just accepting I wasn't gonna memorize everything perfectly the first time. you can always go back

also taking a break and coming back fresh helped a lot

Amber this is SO normal 💕

the detox module is one of the most biochemistry-heavy sections. even practitioners with science backgrounds find it challenging

here's the thing - you don't need to memorize every enzyme and pathway. what matters is understanding the CONCEPT:

- phase 1 makes toxins water soluble (but also more reactive temporarily)
- phase 2 binds them to make them safe for elimination
- if phase 1 is faster than phase 2, you get problems

worry less about the specifics and focus on the big picture. the details will make more sense when you start seeing real cases

also... rest your brain! stepping away for a day can help things click 🌿

Amber one thing that helped me was watching YouTube videos on liver detox after reading the module

sometimes hearing it explained a different way makes it click. there's some good ones that use animations to show how the phases work

also you're WAY ahead of where I was at this point so give yourself credit!
