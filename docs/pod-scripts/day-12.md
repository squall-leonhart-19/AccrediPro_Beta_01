## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post at 0 min

quick question for anyone who's gotten to Lesson 6

I'm working through the "Decode Gut Health Labs" section and there's a part about SIBO breath testing that's confusing me

when they talk about hydrogen vs methane dominant SIBO, how do you actually use that information to design different protocols? like does it matter which type someone has or do you treat them the same?

and if someone has BOTH elevated hydrogen and methane does that change the approach?

I'm trying to understand the practical application here not just memorize the info

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 28 min

great question Cheryl and yes it absolutely matters which type they have 💕

here's the breakdown:

**Hydrogen-dominant SIBO** (most common):
- typically causes more diarrhea, urgency, gas
- responds well to herbal antimicrobials like oregano, berberine
- usually clears faster with treatment

**Methane-dominant SIBO** (technically IMO - Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth):
- causes more constipation and bloating
- harder to treat, needs specific antimicrobials that target archaea (different organisms than bacteria)
- often needs longer treatment protocols
- allicin (garlic extract) and specific herbals work better here

**Hydrogen + Methane** (mixed type):
- need to address both populations
- usually treat hydrogen first, then methane
- requires more complex herbal combinations

this is why testing matters. if you just guess and give someone berberine when they have methane-dominant, it might not work well and they'll think nothing helps

the test results literally tell you which protocol to use

make sense?

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 1 hr 15 min

wow I didn't realize the treatment was that different between types

I'm only on Lesson 13 so I haven't gotten to this yet but this is really good to know

---

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 1 hr 45 min

yes that helps a lot Sarah!

I was reading it like "hydrogen, methane, whatever" but now I see why they spent so much time breaking down the differences

the methane being harder to treat is good to know so I don't promise quick results to someone with that type

---

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 20 min

Cheryl I had a client with methane-dominant and Sarah's right, it took way longer to resolve

if I hadn't known it was methane I would've been so frustrated wondering why the protocol wasn't working as fast as I expected

the testing really does guide everything
