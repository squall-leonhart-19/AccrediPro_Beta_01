## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Amber (VA #1) — post at 0 min

curious where everyone's at! sometimes it helps to know we're not alone lol

I just started Module 7 on hormones and I'm already confused 😅 there's so much happening with estrogen and progesterone and cortisol and how they all affect each other

but I'm taking notes and pushing through

who else is working through modules right now?

---

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 1 hr 15 min

I'm on Module 9! the lab interpretation section is SO good

honestly I think the hormone module was one of the harder ones for me too. it gets clearer when you see it in context of real labs though

you got this Amber! 💪

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 2 hr 30 min

I'm only on Module 3 still 😬

work has been crazy and I keep falling behind. feeling a little like I'm never going to catch up honestly

but I'd rather go slow and actually learn it than rush through and forget everything right?

---

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 3 hr 50 min

Lisa I felt the same way in the beginning!

I'm on Module 6 now but I definitely took my time with the first few. no point rushing

also Module 3 is important so taking your time there is smart. the gut stuff comes up literally everywhere later

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 5 hr 10 min

I love these check-ins! 💕

everyone moves at their own pace and that's totally fine:
- Gina and Amber crushing it ahead
- Denise steady in the middle  
- Lisa building a strong foundation

there's no "behind" here. you're all making progress and that's what matters

Amber the hormone module IS complex but it clicks once you see the bigger picture. keep going! 🌿
