SCREAMING

I JUST GOT MY FIRST CLIENT 🎉🎉🎉🎉

remember the woman who filled out my contact form? we had our discovery call this morning and SHE SIGNED UP

$1,000 for a 3-month program

I literally cannot process this right now. one month ago I was crying over a website. TWO WEEKS ago I had nothing set up. and now I have a PAYING CLIENT

I'm shaking. I'm crying. my husband thinks I'm losing my mind lol

this is actually happening

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 25 min

DENISE!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉💕💕💕

I KNEW IT!! I knew that first client was coming!!

from stuck and overwhelmed to booking a $1,000 client in less than 3 weeks. THIS is what's possible when you invest in yourself and stop waiting for "perfect"

you did the certification. you did the DFY. you showed up for the discovery call. and now you have someone who CHOSE to work with YOU

this is just the beginning. I couldn't be more proud of you 🌿

DENISE YESSSSS!! congrats!!! 🎉🎉

your first client is such a special milestone. you never forget them

$1,000 already!! that's half your DFY investment back with ONE client!!

can't wait to watch you grow 💕

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 2 hr 30 min

Denise I'm literally tearing up reading this

you went from exactly where I am right now to having a paying client in like 3 weeks

I think I need to stop telling myself I'll "figure it out eventually" and just DO something

this is so inspiring

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 3 hr 45 min

congrats Denise!! 🎉

I just started my DFY setup and seeing you already have a client is making me so excited for what's coming

also lowkey glad I finally stopped being stubborn and asked for help lol

---

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 5 hr

thank you everyone 🥹💕

I genuinely could not have done this without this group. and Sarah. and the DFY program

I spent YEARS wanting to do something meaningful and always having an excuse. "not ready yet" "need to learn more" "can't afford it" "don't know how"

at some point you just have to jump

today someone trusted me with their health. that's everything
