### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

you guys I just realized I'm on Module 18

like... there are only 20 modules total?? when did that happen

I remember feeling like this would take forever and now I'm almost DONE

not gonna lie I'm getting nervous about the final exam but also so excited

has anyone taken it yet? any tips?

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 55 min

wait Denise you're almost done?! that's amazing!!

I'm way behind you but honestly seeing you this close to the finish line is motivating me to pick up the pace

you're gonna crush that exam I just know it 💕

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 10 min

Denise the final exam is totally doable!!

I was SO nervous before I took it but honestly if you've been doing the work and understanding the concepts (not just memorizing) you'll be fine

my biggest tip: don't second-guess yourself. your first instinct is usually right

also... celebrate when you pass because it's a BIG deal 🎉

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 3 hr 35 min

Denise you've come so far!! 💕

the fact that you went from "this will take forever" to "wait I'm almost done" shows how far you've come

for the final exam:
- trust what you've learned
- read questions carefully 
- don't overthink the scenarios
- you know more than you think you do

you've got this. I believe in you 🌿

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 5 hr
