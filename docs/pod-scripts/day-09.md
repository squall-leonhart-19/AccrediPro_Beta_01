## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Lisa (VA #3) — post at 0 min

okay I need to be honest about something

I'm loving the content and I'm learning so much but sometimes I get this voice in my head like "who are you to be doing this?"

like what makes ME qualified to help people with their health? I'm not a doctor. I'm not even in healthcare

I know this is all in my head but I can't shake it. does anyone else feel this way or am I just weird? 😅

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 45 min

Lisa I literally felt the EXACT same way

I was a nurse for 15 years and I STILL had imposter syndrome when I started this. like "who am I to think outside the box when doctors know more than me"

but here's the thing... sometimes the people who AREN'T stuck in the traditional system see things more clearly. we're not limited by "this is how it's always been done"

you're learning a different approach. that's valuable

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 1 hr 55 min

Lisa this is so common and I'm glad you brought it up 💕

here's what I want you to understand:

you're not trying to be a doctor. you're becoming a health COACH. you guide people, support them, educate them, and help them make better decisions

doctors have maybe 15 minutes per patient. you'll spend HOURS understanding someone's full picture

the medical system is great for emergencies and acute care. but for chronic health issues? people need someone who actually listens and looks at the whole picture

that's you

you don't need to replace doctors. you complement what they're missing 🌿

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 3 hr 30 min

Lisa I had the same fear!! 

what helped me was remembering why I started. people are struggling and the current system isn't helping them. they need people like us who care enough to learn something different

you being here means you care. that's literally half the battle 💕

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 4 hr 50 min

you guys are gonna make me cry lol

okay I needed to hear all of this. especially the part about not replacing doctors but complementing them. that makes so much sense

I'm not trying to be a doctor. I'm trying to HELP people. that's different

thank you 💕 this group is the best
