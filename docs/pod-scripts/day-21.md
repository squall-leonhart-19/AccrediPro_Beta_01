## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Gina (VA #1) — post at 0 min

small update: just booked my SECOND client!! 🎉

this one came from an Instagram post I made about gut health. she DM'd me asking about my services

$1200 3-month package. that's $2650 total now from just 2 clients

I know that's not life-changing money yet but like... I literally had ZERO clients 6 weeks ago??

this is becoming real

### Amber (VA #1) — post after 1 hr 5 min

Gina you're killing it!! congrats!! 🎉

the fact that she found you from Instagram is so cool. you're building something real

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 2 hr 20 min

this is so motivating honestly

I'm still in the modules but seeing you actually do this is making me feel like maybe I can too

$2650 from 2 clients is really good!! especially since you just started

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 3 hr 45 min

Gina I love watching your journey!! 💕

you went from "how do I even get clients" to booking your second one in like a month. that's FAST

and the Instagram thing? that's organic marketing working. you share value, people see it, they come to you

this is what's possible when you stop overthinking and just start doing 🌿
