## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post at 0 min

GUYS my website just went live yesterday and I already got my first inquiry!! 

someone from a local moms group I'm in. she said she's been following my posts and was so excited to see I'm now "official" 

discovery call scheduled for tomorrow

I'm SO nervous but also this is happening way faster than I expected

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 10 min

Cheryl AMAZING!! congrats!! 🎉

you got this! just remember: she already wants your help. you're not convincing her of anything. just have a real conversation

also: don't undersell yourself on price. I almost charged way less than $1000 and I'm so glad I didn't

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 25 min

Cheryl congrats!! 🎉

one thing that helped me: listen more than you talk. let her tell you her story. people want to feel heard

you've got the knowledge. now just be present with her

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 3 hr 45 min

Cheryl this is SO exciting!! 💕

your first lead already! the fact that she's been following your posts means she's been warming up to you for a while. she's ready

just be yourself tomorrow. you've prepared for this

let us know how it goes! 🌿
