### Cheryl (VA #2) — post at 0 min

SHE SAID YES 🎉🎉🎉

just got off my discovery call and she enrolled in a 3-month program

$1,100!!

I was shaking the whole time but I followed the script Sarah gave us and she actually thanked ME for "finally explaining things in a way that makes sense"

my investment in the DFY program? already paid off. FIRST CLIENT

I can't believe I almost tried to figure this out on my own for another year 😭
