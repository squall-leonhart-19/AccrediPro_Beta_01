## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post at 0 min

welp... I did it too 😬

just enrolled in the DFY program

watching Denise go from stuck to having a professional website in a week broke my brain. I kept thinking "I should be able to do this myself" but... I can't. or at least not in any reasonable timeframe

sometimes you just need to admit you need help

here goes nothing!! 💕
