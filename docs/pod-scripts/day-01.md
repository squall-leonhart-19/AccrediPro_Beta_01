## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Amber (VA #1) — post at 0 min

okay so I just finished the first lesson on the foundations of integrative health and wow

like I thought I knew what functional medicine was but they explain it so differently here? the whole thing about treating root causes vs symptoms finally clicked for me

anyone else have that "ohhhh" moment in the first module?

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 1 hr 10 min

yes!! that's exactly how I felt

the part about how your body is all connected and not just separate organs doing their own thing... that changed everything for me

I kept thinking about how my patients would come in with like 5 different complaints and 5 different specialists and nobody was connecting anything. now I'm like "of course it's all related" lol

it only gets better from here trust me

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 2 hr 45 min

going through the first module right now and I love how they break everything down

I've tried learning this stuff on YouTube before and it was always so confusing or felt like they were trying to sell supplements lol

this is actually structured and makes sense? like I can follow it

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 20 min

love seeing this energy!! 💕

that first module really does set the foundation for everything else. the "systems thinking" approach is what makes functional medicine different from just taking supplements randomly

keep going! every module builds on the one before it, and by the time you're done you'll see the human body completely differently 🌿
