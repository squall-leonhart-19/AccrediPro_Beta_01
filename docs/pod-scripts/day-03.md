## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Gina (VA #1) — post at 0 min

okay I have to share this

so I've had these random headaches for like 2 years and doctors kept saying "drink more water" or "it's stress" which okay fine but that didn't help

after going through the gut health module I decided to try cutting gluten for 2 weeks just to see

you guys... the headaches are basically GONE

I'm on day 11 and I've had maybe one mild headache vs the 3-4 per week I was having before

I'm lowkey shook because I never thought FOOD could do this??

### Amber (VA #1) — post after 55 min

GINA!! that's amazing!! 🎉

the gut-brain connection is SO real. I had something similar with my brain fog - cut out dairy and it cleared up within like a week

it's crazy how much food affects everything and we're never taught this

so happy for you!!

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 2 hr 10 min

this is EXACTLY why I love functional medicine 💕

Gina what you're experiencing is a perfect example of the gut-brain axis in action. for a lot of people, certain foods trigger low-grade inflammation in the gut, which then sends inflammatory signals to the brain

headaches, brain fog, mood issues, even anxiety - so much of it can be traced back to what we're eating

and the beautiful thing is you figured this out yourself just by applying what you learned

THIS is what becoming a practitioner is all about. you're already doing it! 🌿

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 3 hr 45 min

okay this is really inspiring

I keep wondering if this is actually going to work or if I'm just wasting time learning stuff... but seeing Gina actually apply it and get results in like a week?? 

that makes me want to keep going

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 5 hr 20 min

thank you everyone 🥹

honestly I was skeptical too Cheryl. like "okay sure food matters but MY headaches are different" lol

turns out they weren't different at all

if I can figure this out for myself just from the first few modules imagine what we'll be able to do for clients once we finish everything
