## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

I can't believe I'm typing this but

I just officially completed my certification and passed my final exam 🎓

I'm sitting here at my kitchen table with my laptop and it says CERTIFIED and I actually started crying lol

my husband came in like "what's wrong" and I was like "nothing's wrong, I actually DID something, I'm officially certified now"

I don't know what happens next or how I'm going to build this into a real practice but right now I just feel so proud of myself

for anyone still working through modules... keep going. it's worth it. you can actually finish this

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 20 min

DENISE!! 🎉🎉🎉

I'm bursting with pride for you

you showed up. you did the work. you finished something you said you were going to do. and now you're CERTIFIED

that matters so much

take today and just celebrate yourself. you earned this

tomorrow you can think about next steps but today just feel how good this feels 💕

thank you everyone 🥹

honestly this group has been such a huge part of why I kept going
