## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post at 0 min

I don't usually share personal stuff but I feel like this group is safe so...

the reason I'm doing this certification is because of my sister. she's been dealing with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia for 8 years and I've watched her go from doctor to doctor getting nowhere

every time it's "here try this antidepressant" or "it's probably stress" or my favorite "have you tried yoga" 

like... she can barely get out of bed some days and they're telling her to exercise more??

I know I can't fix her but I want to at least understand what might actually be going on. and maybe help other people who are stuck in that same cycle

sorry that got heavy lol just wanted to share why I'm here

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 40 min

Cheryl this is literally why I'm here too 😭

my mom has autoimmune stuff and watching her struggle while doctors just keep adding more medications is so frustrating

I don't think you're trying to "fix" your sister - you're trying to UNDERSTAND. and that's huge. most people in our position just accept "that's just how it is" and do nothing

the fact that you're learning this stuff means you care enough to look deeper. your sister is lucky to have you 💕

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 1 hr 55 min

Cheryl thank you for sharing this 💕

this is exactly why functional medicine exists. so many people like your sister are failed by a system that only looks at symptoms instead of root causes

chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia are often connected to things like gut dysfunction, chronic infections, nutrient deficiencies, HPA axis issues... things that standard medicine doesn't really look for

you're in the right place. and whether you help your sister directly or help hundreds of other people who feel just as lost - you're doing something that matters

I'm so glad you're here 🌿

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 3 hr 20 min

Cheryl your story hit me hard

I'm here because of my own health journey. spent years feeling "off" and being told everything was fine. finally figured out I had hashimoto's that was never properly diagnosed

once I started learning about functional medicine everything made sense. now I want to help other people not waste YEARS like I did trying to figure out what's wrong

we're all here for a reason and yours is beautiful 💕

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 4 hr 50 min

okay I'm actually crying at my phone rn lol

thank you guys. I wasn't expecting this response at all. sometimes I feel like I'm crazy for thinking there has to be a better way

knowing other people get it really helps. I'm definitely in the right place 🌿💕
