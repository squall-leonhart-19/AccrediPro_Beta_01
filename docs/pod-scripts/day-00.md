### Sarah (Coach) — post at 0 min

hey everyone! we have a new member joining us today 🌿

welcome to your study pod! I'm Sarah and I'll be here with you throughout this whole journey

this is your space to ask anything, share wins, work through the hard parts, and just connect with other students who get it

quick things:
- I'm here daily so literally ask me anything
- no dumb questions exist in this group
- celebrate everything, even the small stuff
- we support each other here

some of you are further along than others and that's actually perfect. you learn from the ones ahead and help the ones behind you

introduce yourself when you get a chance! tell us what brought you to functional medicine 💕

### Gina (VA #1 - Leader) — post after 45 min

omg welcome!! 🎉

so happy you're here. I started like 6 weeks ago and honestly it's been the best decision

I was a nurse for 15 years and I got so tired of watching patients just cycle through meds without ever actually getting better you know? when I found functional medicine it just made sense finally

this group is seriously the best and Sarah actually responds to everything which is rare lol

what made you decide to start?

### Amber (VA #1 - Leader) — post after 1 hr 20 min

welcome!! 💕

I'm Amber, about halfway through right now and really enjoying it

one thing that helped me - don't try to rush through everything. I know it's tempting lol but the info really builds on itself so taking your time actually helps

also everyone here is super supportive. whenever I got confused about something I just asked and someone always helped

so glad you joined! 🌿

### Cheryl (VA #2 - Questioner) — post after 2 hr 15 min

hi!! welcome!

I'm Cheryl, started about 3 weeks ago and on Module 5 now

honestly I was kinda nervous at first because I wasn't sure if I could actually do this? but everyone here is so nice and Sarah explains stuff in a way that actually clicks

what part of functional medicine interests you most? I'm really into the gut health stuff so far it's fascinating

### Lisa (VA #3 - Struggler) — post after 3 hr 30 min

hey! welcome 🌸

I'm Lisa and I literally just started last week so we're pretty much in the same place!

I was SO nervous to join omg but everyone has been so welcoming. and the content is actually really good - I was scared it would be over my head but it's explained well

I'm doing this mostly for my family honestly. my mom has autoimmune stuff and I just want to understand what's actually going on instead of watching doctors throw pills at her

what brought you here?

### Denise (VA #4 - Buyer) — post after 4 hr 45 min

welcome!! 🎉

I'm Denise, been here about a month now and I seriously wish I started sooner lol

I spent SO long overthinking it... researching everything, being scared I wasn't "qualified" or whatever, all that stuff. finally just did it and wow I'm so glad

the certification is really thorough and Sarah genuinely cares about us which you can tell

can't wait to see your journey! we're all cheering for you 💕
