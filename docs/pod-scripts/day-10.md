### Lisa (VA #3) — post at 0 min

okay I'm on Lesson 15 now and have a question about the protocol stuff

so they talk about how to sequence protocols for someone with multiple system dysfunctions - like if someone has gut issues AND thyroid problems AND adrenal fatigue

I understand each piece individually but when it comes to applying this to a real person I get confused about where to actually start

anyone else working through this part or am I overthinking it?

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 35 min

such a good question Lisa and this is honestly where a lot of new practitioners get stuck 💕

here's the framework I use when clients have multiple system dysfunctions:

**Always start with gut foundation first** - even if thyroid or adrenals seem like the "main" issue. Why? Because if the gut is leaky and inflamed, nothing else you do will stick. nutrients won't absorb, hormones won't balance, detox pathways won't work

So week 1-4 is typically: remove triggers (food sensitivities, infections), repair gut lining, restore beneficial bacteria

**Then address adrenals before thyroid** - this is critical. if someone's in adrenal dysfunction and you try to support thyroid, you can make them feel worse. the adrenals need to be stable first

Week 5-8: support stress response, balance cortisol patterns, rebuild adrenal reserve

**Then thyroid support** - once gut is healing and adrenals are stable, thyroid protocols actually work

Week 9-12: thyroid-specific nutrients, conversion support, address any remaining barriers

but here's the thing... you're not IGNORING the other systems while you focus on one. you're just prioritizing the sequence while keeping the whole picture in mind

does that help clarify?

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 50 min

Lisa when I had my first client with this exact situation I was so overwhelmed trying to figure out what to work on first

Sarah walked me through this same framework and it made everything click

the gut-first approach really does work. I had a client with Hashimoto's who was convinced her thyroid was the problem but once we healed her gut for 6 weeks her thyroid symptoms improved without us even directly addressing thyroid yet

trust the sequence, it works

### Amber (VA #1) — post after 1 hr 30 min

this is super helpful because I'm on Lesson 13 right now working through the therapeutic nutrition protocols and I keep wondering the same thing about how to sequence everything

glad you asked this Lisa!

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 2 hr 10 min

okay this makes so much more sense now

I was trying to create these elaborate protocols that addressed everything at once and it felt so overwhelming

gut first, then adrenals, then thyroid. I can remember that

thank you both 💕
