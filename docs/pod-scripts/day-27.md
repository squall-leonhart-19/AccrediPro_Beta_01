### Denise (VA #4) — post at 0 min

so remember how I was worried my first client was just luck?

WELL... I just got my second one 🎉

another discovery call this morning. she found me through a referral from a friend who saw my Facebook post about my practice

$1,200 this time. 4-month program with weekly calls

I'm at $2,200 in less than a month. is this real life??

Denise this is insane in the best way

also quick update: my website is almost done! Sarah's team is finishing the booking system this week

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 3 hr 30 min

Denise this is not luck. this is what happens when you're visible + credible + ready to serve 💕

$2,200 in your first month. you've already made back more than you invested in the DFY

and Cheryl - you're next! your site looks amazing and I have a feeling you'll be posting your own client win very soon 🌿
