## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Sarah (Coach) — post at 0 min

okay I want to share something that took me YEARS to figure out and I wish someone had just told me upfront

when a client comes to you with multiple symptoms - let's say fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, and skin issues - the temptation is to try to address everything at once

don't do that

here's the framework I use now:

**Step 1: ALWAYS start with gut**
even if gut isn't their main complaint. 70% of the immune system is in the gut. if the gut is inflamed, nothing else will work long-term. fix the gut first

**Step 2: Then stress/adrenals**
chronic stress messes with everything - hormones, digestion, sleep, immune function. once gut is stabilizing, address the stress response

**Step 3: Then specific systems**
NOW you can look at thyroid, hormones, detox pathways etc. but only after the foundation is solid

I used to try to do everything at once and my clients would get overwhelmed and not follow through. or they'd get temporary results that didn't stick

this order works. trust it

you'll learn this in the modules but wanted to give you the cliff notes 💕

### Cheryl (VA #2) — post after 2 hr 10 min

okay this actually makes so much sense

I was reading through the protocols and thinking "how would I ever decide what to do first??" and was lowkey stressing about it

gut first, then stress, then specific stuff. that's so much simpler than what I was doing in my head lol

thank you for breaking this down Sarah

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 3 hr 40 min

bookmarking this!! 🔖

I literally screenshot this whole thing because I know when I'm actually working with clients I'm going to need this reminder

also the part about clients getting overwhelmed when you do too much at once... I can already see how that would happen

thank you for sharing your experience so we don't have to learn the hard way 💕

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 4 hr 25 min

so glad this helps!! 

the "gut first" approach is kind of controversial in some functional medicine circles because everyone wants to go straight to the "exciting" stuff like hormones or detox

but I've seen it work too many times to ignore. clients who follow this order get results. period

keep learning and keep asking questions! you're all doing amazing 🌿
