## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Sarah (Coach) — post at 0 min

hey everyone 💕

a few of you have been asking about how to handle the business/tech side of things so I wanted to share something

I do have a small program where I personally help set everything up for you. website, booking system, email sequences, client scripts - all of it

I call it the "Done-For-You Practice Launch"

the idea is simple: you focus on helping people. my team and I handle the tech and marketing setup

I only open 4 spots per quarter for this - it's very hands-on and I want to give everyone my full attention. right now I have a couple spots left before I close enrollment

it's not for everyone - some people genuinely enjoy building their own stuff and that's great. but for those who just want to skip the frustration and start seeing clients... this might be a fit

happy to share more details if anyone's interested. no pressure at all 🌿

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 30 min

Sarah this is exactly what I've been looking for 😭

I literally spent 4 hours yesterday trying to figure out Squarespace and wanted to throw my laptop

yes please share more details!! what does it actually include?

---

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 45 min

Denise I did something similar with Sarah a while back and it was honestly the best decision

I was spinning my wheels for weeks trying to do everything myself. once she helped me get set up, I had my first client within a month

just saying... sometimes getting help is worth it

### Lisa (VA #3) — post after 4 hr 10 min

this sounds amazing but probably way out of my budget right now 😅

is there like a payment plan or something? asking for myself lol

---

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 5 hr 25 min

Denise I'll DM you the full details! 💕

Lisa I totally understand - and yes there are options for different budgets. I never want money to be the reason someone stays stuck

the full program is normally $9,997 (you can see everything in the programs section) but I do have a scholarship for engaged students at $1,997 (one time, no monthly fees)

most students make that back with their first 2 clients honestly

anyway, no pressure. just want you to know the option exists 🌿
