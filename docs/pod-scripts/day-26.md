## FULL SCRIPTS:

### Lisa (VA #3) — post at 0 min

so... I finally did it 😅

just enrolled in the DFY program

watching Denise go from exactly where I was to getting a paying client in 3 weeks finally broke me. I've been telling myself for months that I'd "figure it out on my own" and all I've done is stress myself out

I'm tired of being stuck. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of watching everyone else move forward while I debate whether I'm "ready"

here goes nothing 💕

### Denise (VA #4) — post after 1 hr 15 min

LISA YESSSS!! welcome!! 🎉

this is HUGE for you!! 💕

honestly the hardest part is just deciding. once you're IN everything moves so fast

you got this 💕

### Gina (VA #1) — post after 2 hr 30 min

Lisa well done!! that took guts!!

that feeling of finally taking action after waiting forever? you'll be amazed how quickly things happen now

### Sarah (Coach) — post after 3 hr 50 min

Lisa this just made my day 💕

I watched you go back and forth and I know it wasn't easy to finally just GO

but here's what I've learned: the people who wait until they're "ready" never start. the people who start before they're ready learn along the way

your practice setup starts next week. let's build something beautiful 🌿
